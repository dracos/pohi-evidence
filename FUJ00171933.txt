cristina,

Ir agree from looking at the data that something looks off here.

[there are examples of concurrent logins being detected when it appears all the 01 and 02 login are both logged out. At first I
thought it might be a case that the user was logged in at different nodes with the same ID (which is permitted providing other
sessions are locked), but looking at the example for 30th Aug if you track the node logins and logouts, when the concurrent login
as triggered at 12:55, the 01 and 02 logins were both logged out of all nodes.

IT thought the issue was that the user was trying to change SU associations whilst having a locked session for the same Horizon
tb, but if you look at the below sequence, the starting point for which is that 02 is logged out everywhere and 01 is logged in
to node 5 and locked. By the time you get to Event ID 7 which is basically to denote the event where a user tries to change SU
associations for the same Horizon ID which is logged in elsewhere with a locked session, it is pretty clear that the 01 login is
jonly logged in one place at that time (node 5), so there are no other sessions to ‘mark as failed’.

> 01 is locked on SU HH
2. 02 logs on to SU HH and is not locked

3. 01 is unlocked kicking out the 02 login (there should be a message displayed at this point about concurrent sessions, but
Incthing is seen here in Rep Events)

4. This triggers SU HH into a state where a recovery is required
5. 01 then tries to change the attachment from HH to AA when the SU is in a recovery state and that is triggering the issue.
[this is speculation on my part, but there is clearly something amiss. I suggest you get this raised to the IT Helpdesk with a
request for it to be passed to Fujitsu. Please let me have the reference number for the call when it has been raised, and in the
meantime, I will try and reach out to some contacts in Fujitsu.

lcood afternoon,
It looked over the Rep Events Data (I have also attached it to the email).

II have looked at only one user, although the Post Master says this is happening with all users in branch.
so confirmed that the office was not balancing on any of these dates and times.
[This is what I found, can you please let me know what you think.

[cid: image003.png@01N56183.C26CFBFO]
I''m a bit confused about a few things, so I’ve added my notes below.

Jol unlocked HH, Node 3
Jol Log out HH, Node 3

Both users are now logged out - 13:25:09 27-Aug-2019

13:25:43 27 Aug-2019 - 01 Log out HH, Node 2 - How is this possible?

lo2 Log on HH, Node 3

lo2 Log out HH, Node 3

3:26:04 27-Aug-2019 - 01 Log on HH, Node 2

3:26:10 27-Aug-2019 - 01 Log out HH, Node 1 — Logged out in the different node than the one he logged on

Jo Log on HH, Node 1

3:26:35 27-Aug-2019 - 02 Log out HH, Node 1 — 02 is logged onto node 2, so how can it log out on node 1?

jo2 Log on HH, Node 1

Jol Log on RH, Node 3 - 01 looks like it’s logged onto HH on Node 1 and 3 at the same time

3:27:36 27-Aug-2019 - 02 Message: Concurrent login detected for User JS) Node 2 (not locked with 01 user, would this be why
the message appear:

[cid: image004.png@01D56183.C26CFBEO}

It don’t know why he is getting the message on this one as he is logged out with 02 user and with 01 user as well, so why the
essage?

tater on the same day the message comes up again and I have a few questions on this one as well.
[eid: image005.png@0156183.C26CFBFO]

Logged onto HH with 02 on Node 2 and HH with 01 on Node 5 ~ Both Unlocked
joi Attached to AA, Node 5 (existing session for user 01 marked as failed) didn’t lock 02

jo2 Log on HH, Node 2 - was logged out because he did not lock before??

lol Attach to HH, Node 5 (existing sessions for user 01 marked as failed) didn’t lock 02

loz Attach to AA, Node 2 (existing sessions for user 02 marked as failed) didn’t lock 01

02 Log out AA, Node 2 - Would he have been logged out of this automatically?

jo2 Log on HH, Node 2

lol Lock HH, Node 5

jo Log on HH, Node 5 - He locks 01 on HH, Node 5 and then logs onto the exact same stock unit and position?
lo2 Lock AA, Node 2 - He was logged onto HH with 02, so how is he locking in AA?

16:01:13 30-Aug-2019 - 01 Message: Concurrent login detected for User JSifm-jNode 5

sorry about all the questions, I just want to understand this well, so I can explain it to the branch.
Please let me know your views on this, when you can and/or if you need anything else.

[Start of Response]

Users logon to the counter using a Horizon User ID (HUID) but behind the scenes these are linked to a Smart ID (also known as a
PoID). It is possible for multiple HUIDs to be linked to the same POID.

6:28 User:Darran Avenell

[fhe counter should only be displaying message MSG40050 and terminating sessions if the same HUID has an ACTIVE or RECOVERING
lsession elsewhere, not if they have a different HUID but the same POID.

Itt would appear that the system is incorrectly checking for all HUIDs with the same POID though rather than just checking for the
lsame HUID with the same POID. Additionally, it is terminating sessions for any HUID with the same POID instead of only
terminating sessions for the HUID they are logged in as.

lpco279713 has already been forwarded to development for investigation / fix. There is no financial impact but it is
understandably confusing to the users.

in the meantime, the branch users will simply have to accept the current system behaviour.
