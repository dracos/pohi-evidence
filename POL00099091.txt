Subject: RE: Draft statement

Hello Paula, I know we will be speaking in the morning, but I thought it
only fair let you know that apart from a few general points there is one
comment that we, JFSA, would have a problem with if asked

“The report confirms that no systemic problems have been found in relation
to the Horizon system, but suggests that the Post Office should examine its
support and training processes for subpostmasters."

It is the "no systemic problems" comment, and from reading the report it
seems to be because they replaced the word "systemic" with "thematic".

In the past I have made it very clear to many others that it is the
“systemic failures of Post Office" in areas relating to investigation,
support, training, etc., that we believe have been the root cause of so many
victims problems. with that comment as it stands undoubtedly I would be
asked many questions about it.

It seems the use of the word “systemic” is causing us both concern, is there
an alternative?

Regards
Alan

Subject: Fwd: Draft statement

Dear Alan, I haven't heard back from you, so I trust you don't mind
receiving this mail on a Sunday evening. (I texted earlier this evening to
check if it would be ok to send you our draft statement and a copy of the ss
report.)

I understand you already have the report. I attach the Post office draft
statement. We have worked hard on this to retain balance but also to
demonstrate as I mentioned when we spoke on Thursday and Friday, that I am
very serious about how we do respond - with openness to listen and with a
keenness to improve where things could be better.

You will see that I have suggested three commitments, which we will put in
place and I hope as you indicated on our calls, that you will be prepared to
work with us to participate collaboratively and to oversee or help implement
the recommendations.

Additionally, I will as promised meet with you personally after tomorrow, to
hear the detail on how one or two of the past cases were handled, which you
think should be brought to my attention.

Alan - I have just received your text. That is fine, I will try to call you
around 9am tomorrow. And we can fix up where to meet at 3pm at the same
time.

Kind regards,

Paula
