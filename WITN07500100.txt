5. June 2000 — June 2003 Training Officer at NBSC, Dearne House.
6. June 2003 — February 2004 Sick leave and restricted duties.

7. February 2004 — July 2006 Support Administration maintaining a Post Office

database until redundancy so therefore no connection with the

Horizon System.

8. My time as a Postal Officer was at the Leighton Buzzard Crown Office where |

gained experience of manual balancing and Horizon.

9. As the early adopters of Horizon (1993 | think) | do not recall any balancing

problem that did not result from user error.

10.We had one week of training on the Horizon system.

11.My time at the St Albans Helpline dealt with non-Horizon queries.

12.At the NBSC | was involved training Tier 2 Advisors. This was a two week
course covering counter transactions. We had dummy Horizon terminals to

give the trainees an overview of balancing.

13.As the cash account was more specialized it was left to the on-site trainers

who visited the sub-postmasters.

14.For the Tier 2 Advisors we held weekly half hour training sessions to look at

new products and on going changes.

15.As far as | remember the calls from the sub-postmasters were dealt with
professionally using the Knowledge Base which was continually updated by

the Knowledge Base Team.

16.| have no knowledge of any specific request for support that would be relevant

to this inquiry.

17.The most common calls from the sub-postmasters were some of the more
complex transactions like Passport applications, Foreign Currency, Motor

Vehicle Licenses (V10/V11) etc.

18.Wednesday evenings were mostly balancing queries.

19.As a Training Officer | did not deal with the calls directly. My comments are
based on the feedback from colleagues in the training sessions. This enabled

us to prepare remedial training where necessary.

20. The Knowledge Base was the Support Advisers main tool with support from

their Team Leader.

21.1 believe the relationship between NBSC and the Sub-postmasters was good.
We trained them to be as helpful as possible and to call back with answers

that needed further inquiry.

22.|n my view we provided a high standard of support.

23.The Training Team for NBSC Tier 2 were not aware of bugs, errors or defects

in the Horizon System.
