Mick,

I think it would be helpful if you were able to prepare a note outlining what we are doing and why we are doing
it and covering off the input you have taken from various parties including ACPO(S), COPFS, Scottish Agents
etc. I appreciate it would create a bit of extra work for you but it will aid understanding and Scott (and others)
can use it as a reference when briefing his team about the changes. Additionally, it might be helpful if you could
update the interview aide memoire so investigators have a guide. What do you think?

Happy to discuss.

thanks

Rashid

Scott
Thanks for your feedback.

I can appreciate a degree of frustration when you have been following a system for years that seemed to work
and now obstacles are put in your way. The thing is we want to make sure that all our convictions are safe and
that any lines of challenge are minimised.

The two changes that are suggested have worked in England, Wales & Northern Ireland for many years. All
investigators in the other jurisdictions tell suspects that they are not under arrest and are free to leave. Very few
do.

If they do you will have to consider the best way of securing any available evidence and if an arrest is
appropriate as the offence is serious and an arrest is necessary.

Mick,

You asked for feedback and I've summarised some initial thoughts

In addition to being informed of their right to legal advice, whenever a suspect, who is not under
arrest, is cautioned, they should be informed that they are not under arrest and that they are
free to leave. See Above

We don't arrest, therefore we have to inform everyone we interview that they are free to leave? but
we'd prefer if they could stay to be interviewed under caution??? if we are to bring that in I'd prefer
some guidance on the legalities rather than a simple change in policy. I am amending the
Procedures and Standards to give further guidance and I should have them with you today.

Offering legal advice, not sure how we access the web site during an interview, do we all get
phones with Internet access? I am not sure this point is serious but if it is the GS001(S) can be
completed prior to the interview starting, or the interview can be suspended whilst you obtain legal
advice, or you could even go to the interview with a pre-prepared list from the internet.

Are we (Royal Mail) going it alone on the changes or are other non Police reporting agencies doing
likewise. Scotland is fairly unique and changes to legal issues like this are usually doomed to fail!
aren't we in danger of bolting the stable before the horse has even considered its next move? Lets
be progressive and show them the way.

Come 20th October if the decision fails do we revert back to the current position? if so what's the
point changing? It would be an easy to go back to the current system. The point in changing is that
for the next 4 months we ensure that suspects human rights are maintained.

Not sure where this is going, yet again "Best Practice" over legal necessity. Best practice in my
view should always be encouraged.
