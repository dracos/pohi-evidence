terms of a Family Transfer (no monies involved) i.e Mrs Wolstenholme mother

was the previous sub-postmaster and the office was situated in her mothers

Para (7) Ranvir ? I do not remember / nor record the contact number. I was

visited at my home address by a gentleman about the case but cannot remember

who he was.



Para (8) Other than delivering the termination of services letter, I had no further

involvement about Mrs Wolstenholme's contract.




that was the end of my involvement - other than arranging the removal of all

POCL equipment, cash, stock etc. from the premises.




Para (11) I do not recognise any of the names in your paragraph 11
                                                                                             WITNO9530100

        Para (12) A better resolution would have been for Mrs Wolstenholme to allow

        POCL to trade from her premises. She would have been able to receive rent

        from the use of her premises.




        Para (14) Mrs Wolstenholme makes no mention that her husband/partner used

        the Horizon system and was involved in all aspects of the running of the office.
