Subject: Letter from Freeths

Laura,

Yesterday we received a letter from Freeths informing us that they had issued proceedings, on 11 April 2016, against
POL on behalf of 91 claimants. The claim form has not however been served and the letter provides no indication of
when, or indeed if, it shall be. If it is not served within 4 months, the claim falls away unless a new claim form is
issued.

Further, POL has not been provided with a formal letter of claim, which would set out the actual factual and legal
basis of the claim and the remedies sought. Freeths intend to provide this within the next 14 days.

POL is unaware of any new developments in the underlying disputes which might lead us to believe we are any more
exposed on the substance now than previously,

Regards

Mark
