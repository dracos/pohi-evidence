Hi Nick

Please see below the email I sent at 09.54, No idea why it didn't arrive as it hasn't bounced back. I have also re-sent it to Sue in case she didn't receive it. Could I ask

you to let me know that you have received the second attempt please?

Thanks

Subject: Today's Conference Call

SENT ON BEHALF OF GEORGE THOMSON, GENERAL SECRETARY
Dear Sue & Nick
To facilitate the best use of time during our conference call this afternoon, I would like to lay out a framework for a potential agreement as follows:

1. 26 Months compensation for compulsory exiters:

Best year since 2010
Potential community offices named/comfort

Fund to help with outrider leases/recent purchases
Appeal process in exceptional cases (leases, etc.)

2, 1 year of full salary plus agreed extra years for voluntary switchers to PO Local model

© EXAMPLE - if someone with sufficient retail on a £50k total/€12k fixed pay salary switched to a PO Local from traditional, if they signed up quickly, we could give
them 3 years of fixed pay (3 x £12k) = £36k plus £50k lump sum. This £86k could, if POL cash flow allows, create a fantastic new branch.

© No compulsion to switch

© For both Mains (out of hours) and Local switchers, significantly slimmed down and simplified product range.

3. Lump sums to all Post Office agents/operators/subpostmasters:

© £1,400 (2013-14)
© £1,000 (2014-15)
© £1,000 (2015-16)

These payments could be paid as an upfront payment for switchers. I am open to discussion if they should be paid to exiters for all 3 years.

4. POL and NFSP to sign a 15 year contract for the NFSP to represent all post office operators. This will include

Financial agreement
£500k payment 2013-14

£1.25m payment 2014-15

£1.25m payment 2015-16

£2.5m payment 2017 onwards to 2028

This process allows for the drop off of our present membership fee, and facilitates the change from check off towards POL charging a fee from all agents which is
passed directly to the NFSP.

Memorandum of Understanding to be worked on with rights and responsibilities on both sides.

© Ifnecessary, NFSP will drop Union badge to sign contract.

Please note - a signed agreement with the blood of both myself and Paula is necessary on the future of the NFSP before any agreement is granted on either NT and other
points.

To further facilitate our conference call, could I be provided with, for my own use under the terms of the NDA, the following information:

List of branches deemed to be in a strategic location (2,000)
Main Network (2,700)

Community offices (2,000

Current and potential outreaches (2,000)

Current and potential PO Locals (5,000+)

Regards
George
