Subject: Update on Horizon roll-out and results of cash audits as part of the pilot

Mike,

I spoke to Neil Corrick, POL today about the roll-out of Horizon Online and the cash-audit issue.

However, I wonder if this is another example of POL flagging-up a potential issue for concern (such
as the likelihood of significant numbers of sub postmasters resigning at the end of Network Change
when they didn't receive compensation) only for nothing (much) to come of it?

Neil confirms that audits of 150 sub post offices for the initial Horizon Online pilot revealed sufficient
problems around cash to warrant a full cash audit of all branches as part of the full Horizon Online
roll-out. [though surely 'best-practice' would require a full cash audit when implementing any new IT
system responsible for recording cash transactions at branches?]

However, Neil was keen to downplay the significance of the results of the initial cash audits.

He emphasised that - by being open with sub postmasters about the need for a full cash audit in the
communications being sent out about the roll-out - POL doesn't expect there to be major problems
around cash from the audits (as sub postmasters will have had an opportunity to ensure that
everything is in order?).

Neil also made the point that while the letters will clearly flag-up the cash audits they won't make a big
deal about them [my wording, not his].

Finally, Neil confirmed the following:

12 post office branches to receive Horizon Online by the end of this week
Horizon Online to be rolled-out to a total of 260 branches by the end of January
1,170 branches will have received Horizon Online by mid-February

Horizon Online will be rolled-out to all post offices between March and May.
