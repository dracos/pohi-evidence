Alan,

I've now gone through and annotated them as before:

<< File: 8822.ARQEvents2.xls >>

1. ARQ261: There are lots of occurrences of one message. They are all overnight so shouldn't be an issue for
ARQs if no one logged on at the time.

1. ARQ262: Again quite a few timeouts but all at 10pm so provided no one logged on should be OK.

1. ARQ264: Lots of errors from CASEPOSSDailyRecon. SSC need to decide if these are benign. Also a number
of other errors to be investigated further. Mainly restricted to a few days so may not be in ARQ period.

1. ARQ265: Again a lot of unexplained errors that need further investigation. OK if not in ARQ range. I’ve also
marked a number of events as “Ignore” which indicate significant hardware issues so some of these may be side
effects.

1. ARQ266: 2 remaining unexplained errors. Need to get SSC to check them out if they are at vital times.

1. ARQ267: All Clear!

1. ARQ271: 2 remaining events. OK if no one logged on (10pm again)

Regards

Gareth
