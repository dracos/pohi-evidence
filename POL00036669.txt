Classification and Criticality.
Each of the criteria are initially classified as either "hard" or "soft." The former are considered to be within the direct control of the EUM programme. The latter include the establishment of BAU governance arrangements, of which,
the negotiation and agreement of supporting contracts between the various participants is an integral part. They also include work undertaken by individual participants internally to their own businesses.

‘The differentiation between "hard" and "soft" criteria will influence the means by which an assessment will be undertaken on the individual functional areas as well responsibility for providing actual progress information.

POLO0036669
POL00036669

The criteria are also classified as either "critical" or "important". Criteria considered critical (the majority) have to be available at Go-Live. Criteria considered important may not by themselves, signal that a positive decision to Go-Live

should not be taken. However, consideration will need to be given to the cumulative effect of non-availability.

Associated Project activity

Where possible, details of the relevant project work are provided. These are likely to be visible on the implementation plan with progress tracked through regular highlight reports

Target

Reflects the extent to which the functional area is expected to be available at the designated Go-Live date. Because of the inherent criticality of the functional areas, in most examples, a target of 100% has been selected.

RAG rating

The evidence provided shows that, for this area of scrutiny, there are no major outstanding issues that, at this stage,
‘would appear to threaten delivery significantly.

The evidence provided shows that, for this area of scrutiny, there are a number of issues which require management
attention. These appear resolvable at this stage and, if addressed promptly, should not present a project cost/schedule

‘overrun.

The evidence provided shows that, for this area of scrutiny, there are major issues, which at this stage do not appear to be
manageable or resolvable. The project may need re-scoping and/or its overall viability reassessed.
