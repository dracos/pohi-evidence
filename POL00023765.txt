Worth noting that the branch did not have any issues with the mismatched transactions because this was fixed before they did
ihe roll. The branch is not aware of this and it's best that the branch is not advised.

s detailed above, the two POLFS incomplete summaries issues have been resolved.

#The counter problem which caused the first issue has been corrected by inserting a message into the messagestore, for equal
ut opposite values/quantities, as agreed with POL (OCP 17510)

4
As a result of this corrective action, the net effect on POLFS is zero, and POLPS figures are in line with the branch. POLMIS
Keceived both the original message and the corrective message.

nce the problem was corrected, there should have been no impact on the branch. However it has been noted that the stock unit
‘BDC had a loss of $1000, which was generated after the correction was made. We have already notified Gary Blackburn at POL
(email attached). This appears to be a genuine loss at the branch, not a consequence of the problem or correction.

dhen reconciliation is complete, please return the call to SSC so we can pass it on to development.

‘Summary for development:

single SC line was written for $1000 (£484), with no settlement, in the middle of two RISP transactions.

gua

the line was missing some AdditionalData so it wasn't harvested properly, but the main problem was the lack of settlement. POL
buthorised us to insert an equal but opposite message, to prevent a discrepancy (in theory anyway) and to avoid problems on
POLPS. Please note that this is exceptional and must not be seen as a convenient avoidance in place of a fix.

ubsequent investigations showed that a second packed pouch barcode had been scanned, before the receipt for the first had
inished processing. See the audit log / messages on counter 7 26th Nov at 12:43 / 12:44.

00147357 is already with development for what I think is a similar problem - Mode revert:
