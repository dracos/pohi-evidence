Hi Gayle and Jeff — you have both sent me messages today on related topics.
Gayle re escalation and response processes re enquiries that may come from branches.
Jeff re suspense account.

As per your requests, FSC does indeed need to be involved in both. There is also an interaction between each of these
topics.

Andy Winn, Alison Bolsover and myself are all offsite at a finance event today but we would want either ourselves or
an FSC Change Team colleague (from Paul Lebeter’s team) to be involved.

I shall get back to you as a matter of urgency but will start by mentioning to Ali and Andy this pm at our event today.

With Simon Baker on hols just now, who are you taking a lead from here in his absence in a kind of project
management lead across this whole area? I need to catch up with that person.

Thanks, Rod
