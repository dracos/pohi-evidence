Dear Luke

You will recall that late last year Post Office Limited requested from Royal Mail copies of the pre-2011 audit
reports of Horizon produced by Ernst and Young. It was confirmed then that Royal Mail would only be
prepared to provide that material (which we understand includes material Royal Mail considers to be
commercially sensitive) pursuant to a Court Order, but not otherwise.

We are currently in trial in the Post Office Group Litigation, and the Claimants have made a further request
for those audit reports.

Could you please reconsider Royal Mail's position that it would not be willing to provide copies of these
documents without a Court Order compelling disclosure. Post Office’s solicitors Womble Bond Dickinson
(Andy Parsons and Amy Prime cc’ed) will also be sending you a letter more formally making this request.

As I am sure you are aware, the trial into Horizon is currently being heard. Please could you therefore
respond to this email as a matter of urgency.

With thanks and kind regards,

Rodric
