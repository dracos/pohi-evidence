inland Revenue Cashcheques ~ correct accounting
procedure

Operational Focus week 45, article 1 gave details of the new style Inland Revenue Cashcheques which were introduced on
Saturday 1 February 2003.

Unfortunately a large percentage of these Cashcheques are being brought to account wrongly as DWP/SSA(NI)
(Green/Violet) Girocheques. For example, 1,820 cheques were incorrectly brought to account in week 3.

For clarity, branches should summarise each type of cheque as follows:

Inland Revenue Cashcheques

© Treat Inland Revenue Cashcheques as any other Corporate Cashcheques and account as a Girobank withdrawal

© The cheques are summarised on the Girobank Daily Record of Withdrawals (G9902MA) as normal.

Spirit Group Limited ~ change giving account number
correction

Operational Focus week 10 article 1 informed branches that change required for Spirit Group Limited must be drawn
against account number 101 5389 using a Change Giving Transfer form.

Unfortunately the Weekly Accounting section for this article quoted the wrong account number that should be used on
the Weekly Change Giving Summary Form (P3872 for directly managed and franchised branches, P3873 for all other
branches). This should be account number 101 5389, as per the rest of the article, and not 435 9720.

Post Office® card account application form P6168 ~
entering the reference number correctly

We are currently experiencing some operational issues with Child Benefit customers incorrectly recording the reference
number on their card account application form P6168

One of the reasons for this is that the P6168 requests the customer's National Insurance number, whilst the Child Benefit
Personal Invitation Document (PID) uses the customer's Child Benefit number as a reference number.

Counter procedure

To help us control this issue, please follow this procedure when a customer presents their PID at your branch and requests
a Post Office® card account application form:

¢ Take the application form out of the ‘Guide to your card account’ booklet and write the reference number from the top
of the PID into the space provided in Section 1 of the form, next to the words ‘National Insurance number’.

Please note: The reference number on the PID will either be a Child Benefit number or a National insurance
number. Nation: ance numbers have nine charac hild Benefit numbers hav racters, If the
teference number is not in either of these formats the ust not be accep! The
customer referred to the Issuing Authority.

if the reference number on the PID is a National Insurance number:

® write all nine characters in the space provided on the application form.

If the reference number is a Child Benefit number:
© write the first nine characters only on the application form.
* Put the form back into the ‘Guide to your card account’ booklet and pass it to your customer along with their PID.

The delivery address for pre-order Bureau de Change orders _ In addition to the envelopes, a small supply of Cash Advance
