1 Introduction

This document has been produced as one in the series of strategy documents
reflecting the processes involved in the implementation of the Horizon
counter systems. This document defines ICL Pathway’s strategy for the
phasing of the rollout of the Horizon counter infrastructure, whilst giving
consideration to requirements defined by POCL, which relate to the order in
which the post offices are implemented.

2 Scope

The scope of this document is as follows:

e To define the various phases of the programme leading to the start of
national rollout

e To provide a high level overview of the implementation programmes
covering the UK for the national rollout

« To define the implementation programmes and their association with large
conurbations and BA districts, in addition to defining the criteria by which the
programme will be undertaken. Sequencing of the rollout by BA District within
each implementation programme is defined in Ref[1] and Ref[2].

3 Rollout Strategy

The Rollout of counter equipment into post offices has been defined into a
number of distinct phases, which cover the live trial of the early releases of
Horizon. Upon successful completion of the trial phases, the national rollout
of counter equipment will commence through four defined Implementation
Programmes. The preparation of the post office infrastructure to allow the
installation of counter equipment will start prior to and be conducted
separately from the rollout of counter equipment. However, the infrastructure
programme will be undertaken in an order to ensure timely availability of
prepared post offices to satisfy the installation phase.

For each programme the sequence of rollout activities within each post office
has been split into two separate programmes, the Infrastructure programme
and the User Awareness and Installation programme. The Infrastructure
programme covers the activities for each outlet from the issue of the regional
general manager letter through to completion of the site preparation activities
such that the outlet is ready for installation. The User Awareness and

Installation programme covers the Awareness/Training events for the outlet
staff, the installation of the counter equipment, the migration, acceptance and
the transition to steady state.

3.1. Rollout Phases
The defined phases of the rollout are as follows:
3.1.1. Phase 1 - Initial Go Live (Release 1a) installations
During September/October 1996, ten post office outlets in South Wales and
South West region had equipment installed to automate the payment of child
benefit by utilisation of the benefit payment card. The counter systems
installed utilised some hardware components, which were specific to this
exercise and therefore not used in later phases of the rollout programme.
Only one counter position per post office outlet was installed.
Post offices in this phase were in the following BA Districts :
District BA District
Number I District Name
Ref
4.01 101307 _I Bristol Brunel
3.1.2 Phase 2 - Release 1b installations
The outlets identified to receive the Release 1b system are located in South
Wales and South West Region and North East Region. The Release 1b
system introduced the automation of the order book control system (OBCS).
These outlets had counter equipment installed between May 1997 and
September 1997. The number of outlets originally installed was 201. These
post offices, supplemented by those outlets undertaken in Phase 1 would
form approximately two thirds of the post offices required for the live trial.
Post offices in this phase were in the following BA Districts :

Phase 3 - IGL upgrades to Release 1c

Release 1c introduced support for benefit encashment and order book
control. The systems identified as part of Phase 1 were upgraded to target
hardware configurations and with the introduction of release 1c were able to
operate the order book control functionality in addition to the existing
capability of child benefit encashment through payment card.

Post offices in this phase were in the following BA Districts :

Phase 4 introduced release 1c to those post offices installed as part of Phase
2 and enabled these post offices to process child benefit encashment through
payment card, in addition to continuation of the order book control
functionality. The completion of this exercise introduced parity of software
release and hardware component configuration across all currently
automated post office outlets.

Phase 5 - Release 1c upgrades to New Release 2

This phase introduced Release 2 software to the post offices with currently
installed equipment. All installed counter systems were upgraded to new
release 2.

Phase 6 - New Release 2 new installations

This phase introduced 103 new post office outlets, in addition to those
installed in earlier phases. The outlets identified under Phases 1 and 2 were
largely smaller sub post offices. These additional outlets were larger sub post
offices and branch offices, some of which had other automated equipment

Phase 7a — National Rollout Infrastructure Programme - initial start up (3
weeks )

The start of National Rollout Infrastructure Programme was undertaken at
lower than the target beat rate of 300 post offices per week, for a period of 3
weeks. Details of ramp up rates and the associated BA Districts are detailed
in Ref[1]

Phase 7b - National Rollout Infrastructure Programme

This phase is the environmental preparation of the post offices in readiness
for the installation of Horizon counter equipment. The infrastructure
programme is separate to the installation programme and completing post
offices within this programme ensures the post offices are RFI prior to
scheduling into Phase 8. The infrastructure programme began well in
advance of the installation and awareness programme and look to create an
operating surplus of offices. The activities which constitute the infrastructure
programme are defined in Ref[3]. Dates relating to the infrastructure
programme are defined in Ref[1].

Phase 8a — National Rollout Installation Programme - initial start up (11
weeks )

The start of National Rollout installation programme was undertaken at lower
than the target beat rate, for a period of 11 weeks up to the Christmas 1999
period. Details of ramp up rates and the associated BA Districts are detailed
in Reff2]

offices which are available to be scheduled into the installation programme at
the appropriate point in accordance with Ref[2]. Post offices, which are not
available, will be scheduled at a later time in accordance with re-availability of
the post office and the availability of the necessary ICL Pathway resources.
Processes for the management of “sundry” post offices, which cannot be
rescheduled, into this phase, will be detailed in lower level documents. The
activities, which constitute the installation programme, are defined in Ref[3].
Dates relating to the installation programme are defined in Ref[2].

Implementation Programmes

ICL Pathway will manage the national rollout within four Implementation
Programmes. The sequence and concurrency of these programmes is
defined in Ref[2]. These Implementation Programmes map onto the post
office regions as detailed in Table 1 below.

Table 1 - Implementation Programmes to PO Regions

the North East region and post offices in Tyne and Wear

4 I North Thames, East Anglia and the South East region

Implementation Cycle

Following the implementation of approximately 200 post offices running
release 1b and the subsequent surveys and in some cases re-surveys in an
additional 450 post offices, it was apparent that a significant number of
outlets in the post office real estate required extensive site infrastructure
works, to enable the installation of Horizon equipment. In order to undertake
this work and thus de-risk attaining and sustaining the prescribed national
rollout beat rate of 300 post offices per week, the implementation cycle has
been significantly revised. To manage the more volatile activities such as
survey, re-survey, modification and preparation and thus reduce the risk to
the installation beat rate defined in Ref[2], the original implementation
process has been segregated into two discrete and independent

programmes. The activities which constitute each of these programmes is
defined in Ref[3]. The two programmes are

i. Infrastructure Programme
ii. Awareness and Installation Programme

These two distinct programmes are separated by a minimum planning period
of 4 weeks to allow :

a) Scheduling of the post offices within an IBAD into installation units
(InstU’s), at the prescribed rate as defined in Ref[2].

b) Notification of appointment dates to outlet managers or their designated
responsible individuals (DRI).

Where post offices are encountered which cannot be completed due to
external business related influences, these will be managed independently of
the main programme and thus potentially may contravene the defined
implementation cycle. The process for managing post offices such as these
will be detailed in a lower level document relating to the rescheduling
process.

A detailed definition of the implementation cycle is available in Ref[3]

Criteria for Implementation

Where it is stated in relation to specific criteria detailed below, that
reasonable endeavours will be made to ensure they are satisfied, these
criteria are not contractual and therefore do not have any penalties
associated where conformance cannot be achieved.

Rollout Criteria 1

Within each Implementation Programme area, both the infrastructure and
installation and user awareness schedules will be phased by BA districts.
Schedules will then be further sub divided into implementation units (IU’s). An
implementation unit represents a logical grouping of post offices into a single
week of the rollout programme and these are designated as InfrU’s or InstU’s
as appropriate to the programme they are being scheduled into. IU’s will be
scheduled into the infrastructure programme as InfrU’s, for completion of the
defined activities. The IU’s will then be redefined as InstU’s and rescheduled
into the user awareness and _ installation programme. However, this
scheduling process will ensure that requirements 972 and 941 are adhered
to, namely :

¢ Installation will take place in major conurbations first (See Section 3.6)

3.4.4

e The M25 and Northern Ireland will be subject to separate rollout plans.
(See Criteria 4 and 5)

e The M25 rollout will take place during the second half of the overall
timetable. (See Criterion 5)

Reasonable endeavours will be taken to ensure sequencing of the
implementation activities is undertaken in the following order :

1. Completion of BA Districts that are part of the live trial requirement.

2. BA Districts will be undertaken consecutively normally bordering on
an already installed district.

The major conurbations will be completed first within specific implementation
programmes, however later completion of major conurbations, in one or more
implementation programmes will not constrain the continuance of other
implementation programmes.

Rollout Criteria 2

Where post offices within a BA District are not available to be scheduled at
the start of the implementation cycle (e.g. due to planned relocation, major
refurbishment etc.), or become unavailable during the implementation cycle,
then these post offices will be re-scheduled at a time, later in the programme,
to enable the most effective utilisation of ICL Pathway’s field based
resources. This will not conflict with the continuing rollout programme. When
post offices within a BA district, which are not available for scheduling have
been identified, the remaining post offices are grouped into an IBAD.

Rollout Criteria 3

All post offices, which can be scheduled into IBADs, will be implemented in
one continuous programme.

Rollout Criteria 4

Post Offices in Northern Ireland will be implemented as a separate
programme. The implementation of Northern Ireland will take place at the
earliest point within the scheduling of activities in Implementation Programme
1, while giving due consideration to the influencing activities within that IP,
namely

1. Utilisation of ICL Pathway’s and POCL’s field resources in
Implementation Programme 1 to avoid adverse weather conditions
in remote areas of Scotland

2. Scheduling of activities within the Province to avoid the constraining
effects of the Marching Season.

The installation of the BA Districts that have post offices that operate the
ALPS system will commence in the second half of phase 8. The BA districts,
which constitute the “ALPS offices”, are detailed in section 3.9 of this
document.

Rollout Criteria 6

Post offices in Implementation Programme 1 may finish earlier than the other
3 implementation programmes.

Rollout Criteria 7

Rollout activity will be restricted during Christmas periods. The Christmas non
activity periods are defined in Table 2 - Definition of Christmas Periods
relating to the Infrastructure Programme, for the Infrastructure Programme.
For the Installation Programme constraints on activities during the Christmas
periods differ between Christmas 1999 and Christmas 2000. These are
detailed in Table 3 - Christmas 1999 Constraints — Installation Programme for
the Christmas 1999 period, and Table 4 — Christmas 2000 Constraints —
Installation Programme for the Christmas 2000 period. Unless otherwise
defined the Christmas period will be deemed to have ended by the first
working day of January of the New Year. Rollout activities may be undertaken
in post offices during this period by prior agreement between ICL Pathway,
the outlet manager, and the POCL Horizon Implementation Manager.

-1 Infrastructure Programme Christmas Periods

The Infrastructure Programme is undertaken separate to and prior to the installation
programme. As a result, the Christmas 1998 period affects the infrastructure
programme, but has no impact on the installation programme

3.4.7.2 Installation Programme Christmas Periods — Rollout Constraints

The installation programme as defined in Ref[2] spans Christmas 1999 and
Christmas 2000. During the Christmas 1999 period there will be a period of
11 weeks where installation and migration activity will not be scheduled to
take place. As a consequence, training relating to these outlets will also not
take place for an 11-week period. However, because training activities take
place a prescribed period prior to installation and migration activities, the
start and completion dates of the 11-week non training activity period will be
displaced accordingly. Activities other than training of outlet staff, installation
of Horizon equipment and data migration may take place in 5 weeks of this 11-
week period. During Christmas 2000 the Christmas Period will span 4 weeks.
Details of the installation activities on a weekly basis during the Christmas
periods are defined in Table 3 and Table 4.

3.4.7.3 Rollout Constraints — Christmas Period 1999

As a consequence of some activities taking place during some weeks of
Christmas periods, such a period is known as a Reduced Activity Week. A
week of a Christmas period in which no activity takes place in outlets is
known as a Non Activity Week. This concept only applies to the Christmas
1999 period.

3.4.7.3.1_ Reduced Activity Weeks — Christmas 1999

A reduced activity week during Christmas 1999 is defined as a restriction on
which activities of the installation cycle are allowed to take place, rather than
reducing all activities to a lower beat rate. The activities which can take place
in reduced activities are all those activities in the installation cycle as defined
in Ref[3], with the exception of :

Training Of Outlet Staff

Installation of Equipment into Outlets

Migration of Outlets to Horizon
Exceptionally, and in agreement with POCL, outlets originally scheduled in
preceeding weeks to the Christmas 1999 period which have not completed
these activities by the beginning of the Christmas 1999 period, will be allowed

to complete such activities during the Christmas 1999 period, rather than
leave them incomplete for the 11 week period.

3.4.7.3.2 Non Activity Period — Christmas 1999

Those weeks during the Christmas period 1999 designated as Non Activity
Weeks will have no activities scheduled. Exceptionally, installation activities
may be scheduled in agreement with POCL, but these will not extend to :

Training Of Outlet Staff
Installation of Equipment into Outlets
Migration of Outlets to Horizon

3.4.7.3.3 Christmas 1999 Constraints

Table 3 - Christmas 1999 Constraints below defines the weeks of the
Christmas 1999 period and details within the table those activities
which are permitted to take place during each specific week. All
activities defined in this table, refer only to activities being undertaken
in post office outlets and do not constrain any non outlet based
activities (e.g. HFSO training).

3.4.7.3.4 Uncompleted Sites

There is an additional column detailed in Table 3 - Christmas 1999
Constraints, namely “Uncompleted Sites.” This defines the week in
which completion of installation activities can take place where sites
have failed to complete prior to the start of the Christmas 1999 period.
Sites, which can be completed during this week, will be those sites
which have not been completed in their scheduled week, due to issues
which have since been resolved. Completion of such sites will be
agreed between POCL and ICL Pathway prior to agreement being
sought with the outlet manager. Completion of these sites can only
take place in the week commencing 8" November 1999.

The overall sequence of BA Districts by Implementation Programme is
defined in Ref[1] and Ref[2]

Lists of post offices by BA District, due to be scheduled into the infrastructure
programme, will be generated and distributed to POCL regions 6 weeks prior
to activities starting in a single or the first of a series of BA Districts. These
will be in units of 4 weeks and could therefore span one or more BA districts.
Post offices not available to be automated will be highlighted by POCL
regions. The available post offices within a BA District(s) will therefore
constitute an IBAD. POCL Regions must return information detailing office
availability, 3 weeks prior to the start of the infrastructure cycle for those post
offices. The post offices are then scheduled into implementation units (IU’s)
and schedule information issued to POCL and ICL suppliers from the rollout
database via the prescribed and agreed routes, 2 weeks prior to the start of
activities.

Outlets being scheduled for the installation will all be assumed to be
available, on the basis that outlet managers will have received prior
notification of their inclusion in the installation programme through the RGM2
letter.

Completion of acceptance, following the installation and migration activities,
in all post offices on a given day of rollout activity, will be notified to POCL.
