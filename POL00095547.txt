As I have not had any issues raised from a fraud perspective over the declaration issue, the decision on implementing the
proposed options will rest with Network (Michael).

Michael / Neil — As the impact will only be on branches (No impact on end users of COH data), the final decision of what
change is made (if any) can be resolved between yourselves and Gareth.

As mentioned briefly yesterday this is details of the bug fix that the IT team have offered to fix. Michael Haworth has a
better understanding of the issue and will ultimately make the decision on whether this is implemented. I

Hi Doug,

I understand Carol has forwarded you Gareth's proposal document around handling declarations and would welcome your

As per my e-mail to Carol & Jane, I’m happy to set up a conf call with Gareth if that would help.

Neil

Ultimately Doug Brown is the person you need to be talking to as his team use the declarations.

I have sent him your mail and I think it would be best to contact him to discuss the proposal.

We have not been able to complete the Flexible Planning /POLSAP comparison since HNGX go live.
Cheers

Carol

Hi Carol & Jane,

Wonder whether you could have a look at the attached paper from Gareth Jenkins. I know we had lots of issues with
declarations during the Horizon Online rollout last year, but I have not been involved in this area since then, so would
welcome your expertise in commenting on what Gareth is proposing.

As far as changes to requirements in DOORS, I can do that, really just need some business direction in how we want to
play this.

Happy to discuss and maybe arrange a call involving Gareth as well if that helps.
If there’s anyone else who you think would add value here please let me know/feel free to forward this on.

Regards,

Neil,
I’m not sure if you’re the right person to ask: if not, perhaps you can suggest who is.

We've identified an issue with Declarations that could cause confusion if there are old Declarations that are
not updated.

I’ve tried to summarise the scenarios in the attached note and I’ve also suggested some simple changes we
can do to try and reduce the confusion and make things a bit more consistent. I’ve also suggested some
improvements that could be made if you would like to sponsor an enhancement in this area.

<<Declarations.docx>>
'd appreciate your views.

If you’re happy with the proposed approach we will make the changes under Peak. We will also suggest some
improvements to the UCs / BRUs via the QA process so that they are clear in future.

Happy to talk this through if that’s easier.
Regards

Gareth
