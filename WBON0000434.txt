I’m happy to delete the underlined bits you want to delete and I agree with your reasons for wanting to delete
them.

I fully understand about victimisation. Let’s see what (if anything) the client is willing to live with and then discuss
next week.

I think we are getting there, by the way. I’m beginning to like the letter!

Thanks Tony
This all looks good save for a couple of points.

I'm still slightly uncomfortable about 11.1.2 on victimisation. I think giving any form of concession will come back to
haunt us. We'll leave it in for now and then perhaps we can discuss next time we speak

Para 5.14 on training assistants, currently reads (emphasis added):

"As explained in Section 4, Post Office accepts it has a duty to offer training to postmasters. That offer has to be

accepted by Postmasters. It has no duty to train assistants where not requested by postmasters. As is clear from
Section 15, Clause 7 of the Standard Subpostmasters Agreement, responsibility for the training of assistants falls on

the postmaster."

I'm not sure this is correct or would be accepted by Post Office. I think Post Office would say that it has no obligation
to train assistants whatsoever. From an operational perspective, a duty to train assistants, even if it is conditional on a
request from the SPMR, could cause Post Office major difficulties. There are about 50,000 registered assistants using
Horizon and if POL suddenly had requests to train all of them, it would grind the business to a halt.

I'd like to delete the bit underlined in the above para. I'd also like to delete the reference to assistants in 4.35.2 —
underlined below.

"It is accepted that Post Office is required to provide (through the Helpline or otherwise) such technical advice
and support as would be necessary to enable a competent and diligent postmaster and/or a suitable,
competent and diligent assistant to operate the Horizon system sufficiently well to discharge the postmaster's
accounting and related obligations under the agreement."

Thoughts?

Dear Andy,
Here’s the letter.

You will see that I have tracked the changes since the version I sent you yesterday. You will also see some
comments on consistency of formatting etc at the beginning of the letter, and that the body of the letter has more
than a couple of changes (not least because I did a spellcheck this time). I hope that these changes don't cause
you any problems — the ones I would really like you not to leave out are in paras 22.1.3 and 6.34 and 11.1.2 (a
suggestion on victimisation which would make our lives easier). I have suggested some changes to sections 9-13
which I think make them better but are not crucial.

Best wishes,

Tony

Very good, I'll send them over later, having tracked the changes from the version I sent you earlier.

By the way, regarding the Willers v Gubbay case which I have referred to in the letter in the context of malicious prosecution, I see
that the case has already gone to the court of appeal and will I think be the subject of a judgment of the Supreme Court to be
handed down next Wednesday (see attached email). On any view, what I say about the case in the letter is not the last word and
the case will need to be reviewed before the letter is sent out.

Dear all,

Here is where I have got to with the letter, working too fast and without checking things, proofreading or even making a

spellcheck. I have just about got to the end of section 8, although my review of everything from section 7 was quite hurried.
Thave not looked at the remaining sections of the letter but I have looked at the schedules and have many proposed amendments
for them. They are not huge amendments but they will improve the quality and avoid some hostages to fortune. Do you want me

to klet you have them? If so, I will not be able to turn to that until after 3pm.

Let me know what you wat me to do. Please note that I expect to be out of circulation for almost the whole of the weekend and
much of the early part of next week. However, that may suit you!

I'm not sure the nature of the proceedings are key ~ the key point for us may be that the tort of abuse of the process (Crawford
does not call it malicious prosecution) requires bringing proceedings for a purpose other than the recovery of the money sought in
the proceedings, which is clearly not our case and which they do not even allege here.

Hold on, though — who’s currently in charge of the travelling draft?

Iwas going to ignore it as they haven't put forward a case on this. May be we just add a footnote.

Paul, Would you mind addressing this point? I think you can only bring an MP claim for certain types of civil proceedings, not all
civil proceedings. Ask Amy, she might know the case law on this.

Andy, is anyone proposing to deal with their argument that we are liable for malicious prosecution in relation to the civil
proceedings we have brought? For this purpose, they are relying on Crawford Adjusters v Sagicor. Should the letter not be

We agree with your amendments. We'll tidy up the letter, chase down your questions and get this sent.

On the Comm Ct point, I agree that if this is to be even a viable option we need to do it in a transparent manner which means
setting it up in correspondence first.

Do you have an ETA on the sections you / Owain were amending on the LOR?

Dear Andy,

Here are my suggestions for your letter. I hope they are self-explanatory. Given the time pressure, I have not rigorously gone
through the order to ensure that it all fits together on our case (that it should be in the commercial court etc).

Tom’s suggestion really is brilliant. However, if we suddenly made an application to the commercial court in an attempt to steal a
march on the other side, this would go down very badly with both courts. I have added some wording to the letter and have
amended the Order in ways that are designed to provoke an unequivocal response from Freeths that they will absolutely never
agree to transfer. If and when that happens, and depending on how they express themselves, we might have an opportunity to reply
by saying something like (1) the parties agree that there should be a GLO and it is now clear what the issues are because we’ve
served our letter of response, (2) it is also clear that we are never going to agree on forum, and that this is the most urgent issue,
and (3) we've considered how best to resolve that issue and it seems to us that the quickest and most appropriate procedure is
through an application for a GLO to be made by the commercial court, and (4) obviously, the claimants will not be making this
application but the defendant will and (5) the claimants can expect to receive the necessary papers shortly.

I’m more than a little concerned that this could end up rebounding on us, but let’s decide once we've sent our letter of response.
Best wishes,

Tony

Subject: GLO Letier [(BD-4A-FID26859384] ~~

Tony
Please find attached a draft letter to Freeths and an amended GLO for your comments.

Tom P came up with an interesting, if slightly mischievous, idea on the issue of moving matters to the Commercial Court. Both
Claimants and Defendants can apply for a GLO at any time, even before a Claim is issued or served. Post Office is therefore at
liberty to apply to the Commercial Court for a GLO. The fact that Freeths have issued in the QBD doesn't prohibit such an
application.

Therefore, rather than try to transfer the QBD Claim to the Commercial Court, we could simply make our own application to the
Commercial Court for a GLO (which would include the usual direction that all claims be moved to the Management Court ie. the
QBD claim would be moved to the Commercial Court).

Too mad or worth consideration?
