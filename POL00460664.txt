Jane, just before we close for the weekend, i thought i would comment on your exchange with Tom and Henry.
A reluctant support for a 5% pay increase, a 3 year £150k retention and possible support for a 50% STIP/LTIP
for next year is insulting/risable, particularly given what was being recommended pre Christmas. I fell played.
Please will you arrange for a formal meeting with Henry on Monday.
