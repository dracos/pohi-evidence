1.0 Introduction

This document reports on the issues of the failure of Fujitsu Services to Deliver APS Client
data files and CTS reconciliation’s issues.

This report covers:
- How the problems came to light
- The impact on the branch service
- The investigation
- The resolution
- The root cause

- Actions and recommendations to prevent recurrence

2.0 Scope

The scope of this report covers the failures of Fujitsu Services to Deliver AP client data to a
number of AP clients, those of which do not receive files on all 7 days of the week, between
the period 10" July — 15" July 04. Attached at Annex A provides a complete list of clients

It also covers the failure to produce automated APS reconciliation reporting accurately in the
form of the daily CTS file produced, between 10" July 04 — 29" July 04. It should be noted
that whilst automated process was non operational manual reporting was being covered daily.

3.0 Management Summary

The problem was initially discovered following the weekend of the Data Centre upgrade 9" —
10th July 04. Following the overnight schedule on the 11" July 04, at approximately 09:30
Monday 12" July 04, POL informed fujitsu service’s, service Management that there was
possible errors in the CTS file. It was suggested that this file was considerably less value than
would have been normally expected the approximate value of transactions expected being
reduced by up to £30 million.

Throughout these problems the correct escalation routes — including to POL — were followed

Full services were resumed on 15" July 04, following successful development and testing of
the required scripts prior to release into the live estate for all AP client stranded data.

The fix for the CTS reconciliation’s problem was delivered to live on 29" July 04.

COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 24th-Aug-2004

5.1 Symptoms and Business Impact
5.1.1 Symptoms as seen by Branches & Post Office Ltd.
5.1.2 CTS File Impact

The CTS file had been reported as being considerably under value than expected. The effect
of the reconciliation reports being incorrect would have impacted POL’s financial settlement
with their AP clients. Volumes of client enquiries to POL regarding the missing data and
subsequent client settlement, meant that POL had to settle a number of client account on
previous trend data. The effort required to settle client accounts and the subsequent
adjustments once the true figures had been obtained caused a considerably amount of extra
work involved.

4.1.3 AP stranded Transactions Impact

The potential impact of the incident where AP transactions were not migrated from Dynix to
Solaris during the S60 Data Centre upgrade was high. All clients who do not receive files 7
days a week were impacted by this, 5 -6 day a week clients did not received data harvested
Friday 9th and Saturday 10th July and 6 day a week clients did not receive data harvested
Saturday 10thJuly.

The impact is both visible to the AP Clients and their customers with no record of their
transaction being received by the AP Client, this could cause red bills, customer
disconnections for utility companies and BT, penalty charges or court action due to late
payments, cancellation of insurance for AON and would be very visible to the customer.
Branches would be receiving complaints from customers who had paid but their account had
not been debited and the Helpdesk would have been receiving calls both at Post Office and the
AP Clients.

5.2 Detailed explanation of the incident

Clients affected are those that receive files on a 5 day or 6 day basis. These clients receive a
‘mop up’ file on a Sunday, which includes Friday and or Saturdays files plus any from the
Sunday. The clients had been sent the Sunday file but this file only contained Sunday data and
did not include the data from Friday and/or Saturday.

This has been diagnosed as affecting those Post Office clients whose transaction data, put
through the system on Friday prior to the Solaris port, was scheduled to be sent on

Monday. As per normal operation, these transactions were captured in 'Pass Through’ files,
generated by Dynix. There was a migration step missed in the port to Solaris and these
transactions were not migrated into the Pass Through tables in the Solaris database. The net
effect being that any transactions generated on the Dynix database not processed that evening
for transfer to the clients are still being held in the Pass Through files.

« There were 581,481 transactions in the pass through files that were not processed.
These include Reversed/Reversal pairs that should not be sent to clients.

« There are 578,091 transactions not placed into client transmission files.

« These transactions had a value of £22,421,647.86

The difference between these figures and those supplied _on Monday 12" July 04 is explained
by the inclusion of Saturday and Sunday transactions that were sent to clients. These figures
are shown on reconciliation report APSS2133 in the reconciliation error line for processing
dates 11/07/2004 and 12/07/2004.

Note that the reconciliation reports include Reversed/Reversal pairs .

It should be noted that, additionally, senior management in POA and, onwards, senior
management in POL were advised of these issues during the day.

7.0 Problem Management

The problem (PM0000503) was raised on 12" July 04 at 12:01, the problem was well
managed and the appropriate procedures were followed. POL were kept fully informed as to
the Root cause, actions being taken & the expected fix time, daily conference calls were set-up
to monitor the progress and overall understanding of the problem, theses were then handed
back over to formal problem Management procedures on Tuesday 13" July 04 at 16:00. Daily
updates were provided to POL and Fujitsu Business Managers until the problem had been
rectified.

The script (fix) for the stranded APS client data was delivered into live the evening of the 14"
July 04, for overnight processing 15" July 04 following successful development and LST
testing. The problem is still active on the PMDB at the moment following a period of
monitoring, the forecast closure date being 4th Aug 04.

APS Client CTS file errors, the above problem reference number exist for both calls. POL
were kept fully informed as to the Root cause, actions being taken & the expected fix time
scale. The final fix for this was delivered to live on 29" July 04, after extensive development
and testing, this being more prolonged due to the extraordinarily amount of data that had to be
checked.
