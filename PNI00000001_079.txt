Dear Sirs,

Re: R-v-Maureen McKelvey
Crown Court Dungannon 13.09.04

Your correspondence dated 22 July 2004 addressed to D/Con Coyle has been passed
to me for reply.

Please note that all correspondence relating to this matter should be addressed to this
office. By forwarding correspondence to police direct, you delay the matters raised
from receiving attention.

I confirm that I have asked the officer in charge to liaise with Suzanne Winter in order
to deal with your request for further disclosure and will write to you again in due

course.

Yours faithfully,

Brian Curran
Western Circuit
for Director of Public Prosecutions.
