Andy

Updated draft factfile is attached incorporating further comments from Gayle and Andy Holt. Generally, Andy said he
could provide detail on the extensive processes involved with making amendments/software updates to Horizon (it's
not a case that Post Office make changes whenever they want and they are audited each year) —- maybe see what
feedback we get from the Programme Board? I can pick this up with Andy if it would be useful.

I have also addressed the point’s in Rod Ismay's emails (attached), though some of the jargon is hard to follow (the
paragraph references to correspond with our draft as we have added in paragraphs — I think they are generally about 2
out).

I have emailed Rodric — will let you know if I get anything from him this evening.
