[Informat ioi

pm has checked for stock adjustments in the trans. log and
this showed that pm had adjusted his stock from £155 to zero
because on the tue no transactions where done and chq

figure should have been zero.

Jpn then looked in adj stock again and £155 was still

there, pm called hsh several times and was unable to remove this
amount, rolled over on wed with a minus of £155 in chs.

information: attempted contact pm: no answer.

ill need to make further checks: check Rem summary report
(c.weekly) for any rem reversals or rem in in error, check

hat figure on the listing report from tues. night, ie was

the wrong figure remmed out tues night, leaving £155 on the
jreport? was a POCL cheque remmed in incorrectly?

lAdvice: this trnasaction was done after 2.30pm but the clerk who
was attached to the individual SU went home at 2.30. the SU is
called EE and the transaction could possibly be a road
ltax..they only know this because of the value this is all the
info the PM has available..he understands that it cannot be
reversed now he has rolled the office but would like it
investigated just for piece of mind

IPRESCAN -

this is not a software problem, it is a training issue, SSC do not provide a
"find the transaction service” currently, the PM must make more creative use
lof the transaction Log.
