Just a brief update. The FT is running a piece on Horizon tomorrow, focussing on a "dream turns to nightmare" angle.
We are currently reviewing the copy and will challenge inaccuracies and any other issues.

The BBC One Show is planning a further piece to coincide with the parliamentary debate next Wednesday. We are
putting a lot of work into preparing our position for that and I will update you as things develop.

We are also planning to produce a film for internal audiences to explain the issue and what we are doing. I hope to have
this ready to air by Wednesday.

Any questions please don't hesitate to ask.
Best wishes

Mark
