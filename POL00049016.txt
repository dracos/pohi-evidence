REGINA v JANET LOUISE SKINNER

HULL CROWN COURT

CONFISCATION HEARING - 29" AUGUST 2007
CASE NO: POLTD/0607/0108

The above named appeared at Hull Crown Court on the 29" August 2007.
The prosecution was represented by Patricia Doherty of Counsel.

You will recall that the Defence were arguing that the proceedings were an
abuse of process as the Defendant was charged with false accounting thus
could not have benefited. You will be pleased to hear that the Judge did not
accept the Defence argument.

Negotiations did take place in which the Officer was involved. It was agreed
that the Defendant had benefited by her criminal conduct to the sum of
£59,175.39. The recoverable amount was assessed at £11,000.

The Court ordered that the Defendant should pay within 6 months and imposed
12 months imprisonment in default.

I understand that a copy of the Order was handed to the Officer, however I
will arrange for a further copy to be sent to me.
