Mike,

Alice has requested a defensive line if we're pushed on whether CO should do the review rather than a POL appointee.
Pls cd you and Ronan/Mike work up an appropriate line - majoring on the opening words of our line, ie operational
matter which POL is taking clear steps on.

will.

Ronan

Many thanks.

Our suggested defensive lines if approached are:

‘The issue is an operational and contractual matter for Post Office Ltd. Its Horizon computer system,
operated in all branches for over 10 years, has been rigorously tested using robust independently -
assured processes.

POL has commissioned an independent, external review of a small number of individual cases,
raised by MPs to provide clarity to the MPs concerned. POL remains fully confident about the

robustness and integrity of its Horizon system and related accounting processes."

Any further media queries should be directed to POL press office.

POL00143205

For my background at this stage, is there clarity yet on whom, in the final para of the JA statement,
MPs (and if wished MP's spm constituent) will meet. Is this POL or the case reviewer ? And who will
be undertaking the individual case reviews?

Regards

Hi Mike

Mike Granville has asked ne to forward this to you

Post Office spokesman said: "The Post Office continues to have absolute confidence in the
robustness and integrity of its branch accounting processes. Over the past ten years, many millions
of branch reconciliations have been carried out with transactions and balances accurately recorded
by more than 25,000 different subpostmasters. The Post Office has no hesitation in agreeing to an
external review of these few individual cases that have been raised with us by a number of MPs."

* This affects a very small number of individual cases (about 10). To put this into context, over
the past ten years, many millions of branch reconciliations have been carried out with
transactions and balances accurately recorded by more than 25,000 different subpostmasters.
+ The Post Office continues to have absolute confidence in the robustness and integrity of its
branch accounting processes.

+ We are not independently reviewing our systems. We have agreed with MPs to commission
an external review of a small number of individual cases and report back on these. We already
have processes in place to ensure that systems and processes are fully audited and are robust.
* Post Office Ltd will be funding this work. We must therefore have due regard for making sure
that public funds are spent sensibly in considering the specific numbers of cases where we will
undertake these processes.

+ Post Office Ltd is happy to respond to the need for information from MPs who are responding
to concerns by a small number of their constituents. The activities we have put in place in
agreement with these MPs are proportionate and should help to clarify often complex issues.
