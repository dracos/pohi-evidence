Both — thanks for your respective emails. I will take a look and amend Jo’s speech accordingly but given that I am
about to get in a car for a couple of hours to drive back home I thought it might be expedient to get this off to you
now to do it a sweep of things we shouldn’t say. I hope I haven’t gone too far — the problems is that ideally we
wouldn’t be having this debate, but as we are Jo has to be able to say something reasonably concrete in response to

the accusations.

Thanks to both of you for your help to date on this.

Cheers
R
