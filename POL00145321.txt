Dear Paula

Many thanks for the update; I've been following the issue as it emerged.
T have a cup of tea scheduled with James on Thursday this week, so I'll let you know how that goes.

Keep smiling and best regards

Simon, hi. I have just tried to call you but no signal (could be my problem as Duncan and I were cut off).

Just to advise that our minister has decided to make a statement in the House. She is likely to say
Horizon appears to be clear, but that bugs happen, and where they have it and the business have
responded appropriately. (This is the main issue that has been covered by the BBC.)

She will also say that there are training and support issues that can be improved for those struggling;
but that in the main most Spmrs are well supported by the overall system.

Thank you both for your support.
Paula
