Bates & others v Post Office

Board Sub-committee: 21 February 2019

Speaking note

Headlines

e The trial in March is focused on the Horizon system. There
are 15 questions for the Judge to address, which fall under
three core topics:

1. Is Horizon robust or does it cause shortfalls in SPM
branches?

2. Are PO and FJ able to manipulate Horizon data in
secret and without the knowledge of SPMs?

3. And finally, a group of factual questions about certain
aspects of the system that if determined now will be a
useful foundation in other trials.

e In my assessment, the evidence weighs in favour of Horizon

being a robust system. There is little risk of the Judge saying

that Horizon is bad but he may find that it is only "ok" and/or
that in some areas it could be improved

This trial will come down to whose expert is more credible.
We believe the evidence of our expert, Dr Worden, has a
better methodology and is more cogently evidenced that the
Cs expert, Mr Coyne._His approach has been to pick as

many holes as possible without considering them or their
impact too carefully, which lacks balance.

e The secondary battle will be keeping the Judge focused on
what is important. The Cs will attempt to draw attention
away from the experts (where they are somewhat weaker)
and towards eye-catching issues such as Fu's ability to
remotely change Horizon data and side issues such as a
perpetual complaint that PO has provided insufficient
disclosure of documents. They will use this to paint Post
Office and Fujitsu in a bad light but these points don't go to
the core of whether Horizon works.

e We also have to factor in a good deal of jJudicial risk as this
Judge as acted in ways that are truly extraordinary as you
will have already heard from David Cavender on the
Common Issues trial.

Our case

e The core argument we will run in Court is as follows.:
o Horizon like all IT systems is not perfect but it is a very
good system.
= This is not about proving that Horizon is perfect
and that there are no bugs in Horizon.
= In the context of this litigation, it is about showing
that Horizon accurately records transactions the
vast majority of the time so that PO, SPMs and
the Court can safely start from an assumption that
the branch accounting information held on
Horizon is sound.
o No-one has found a fundamental flaw in the system or
its support processes. We are nowhere near a
I situation where this a bad or even average system. In
practical terms, tFhis is a decision between whether
Horizon is good or very good.
I o One would expect imperfections and bugs to occur in
any large system of this sort. But Horizon has been
designed and supported carefully over many years,
with many countermeasures in place to spot and

AC_154286889_1 2

WBD_001292.000002
WBON0001422
WBON0001422

correct problems as they may arise. The service
history of Horizon is comprehensive and shows these
countermeasures in action time and time again. They
were plainly effective in practice.

o The highest the Cs can put their case is that of the
many thousands of issues which inevitably arise on a
system of this scale, they have identified a couple of
dozen bugs over 20 years which according to them, did
or may have caused loss to a SPMR:

= SeveralMany of the "bugs" they claim to have
found are no such thing. They are simp!-not
bugs at all. Indeed, they often supportpreve PO's
cases that there were effective countermeasures.

= Of the Anyactual bugs found, many have no
bearing on the critical issue in this case, i.e. those

bugs either did not affect branch accounts or they
were picked up and fixed relatively quickly in the
ordinary course of Horizon’s operationare

: = ; ,
system.they-are not even in_parts_of the system

that-are in everyday use._They are obscure.

= Many of thosethe bugs are also triggered by
relatively unusual events: —SPMs doing
unexpected things with the system and some
cases doing things that are in breach of PO's
operating rules.

*oCs argue that there could be thousands of undetected
bugs lurking in the system, but this is based on little
more than the (obvious) point that it is not possible to
say that all bugs are always detected whenever they
appear. Cs have no evidence to justify the supposition
that that there could be many lurking bugs having a
significant impact on a significant number of branch
accounts. PO’s expert has a persuasive analysis
suggesting that there is nothing like the number of
undetected bugs in Horizon that there would need to
be in order to explain even a material portion of the
losses alleged by the Cs. The Cs’ expert does not

AC_154286889_1 3

WBD_001292.000003
WBON0001422
WBON0001422

have a rival analysis and, although he tries to pick
holes in PO’s analysis, he does not really grapple with
it.

The simple fact is thath-anyevent, taking into account

the size of the Horizon estate and the period of its
operation, the volume of bugs Cs have found is tiny.

About 20 bugs over an 18 year period, against a back
drop of 30,000 active users and 50m transactions a
week.
= Even if one assumes that the Cs case is entirely
correct, Horizon would still be a robust system.
= This is PODrWerdenr's expert's clear and well-
explained opinion.
= Cs expert cannot even bring himself to give a
clear opinion that Horizon is not robust, which is
very telling as to the truth of the matter.

e This is the narrative that we are proposing be put to the
Court and around which we will arrange our detailed
submissions and the evidence.

e The strength and formulation of this narrative may need to
be adjusted in light of -the Cs supplemental expert report
served on 1 Feb this year.

o Up to Christmas, we were feeling confident about PO's

AC_154286889_1

position. The Cs first expert report was poor and we
had answered it comprehensively in Dr W's reportwere
prepared to respond _to it.

On 1 February, they served their supplemental report.
It is anything but supplemental. It raises a whole new
range of issues, including about 15 new alleged bugs
in Horizon that have not been raised before.
Consideration was given to whether to seek an
adjournment to the trial but this would have been be
Aigh-impossible with our Judge who is obsessed with
speed of resolution at all costs, even if that creates an
unfairness. An adjournment would not have been

supported by Cs.

o The legal team and FJ are now working ferociously to
investigate these new points. Progress so far has
been good. E-xtracting relevant and reliable
information from FJ in a timely fashion can be difficult,
but and-se-we are hopeful, but not certain, that we will
have credible counter-points to raise to most of
Coyne's new attacks.

e My assessment of the case is therefore premised on FJ
being able to supply good ammunition to counter-act
Coyne's late arguments. This seems likely but until the
investigations are complete we cannot be certain and we
are about a week away from that point.

Risk 1: High bar.

e PO has necessarily set its case very high: that Horizon is
robust and extremely unlikely to cause shortfalls. It has
done this for two reasons:

e First, this was the finding from Deloitte's investigation into
Horizon at the outset of the litigation and on which PO
premised its legal position.

e Second, PO's operating models are built on the assumption
that Horizon works.

o The heart of this litigation is whether SPMs should be
liable for shortfalls. The Cs main line of attack is that
the shortfalls were not caused by them but by bugs in
Horizon.

o Inits interactions with SPMs, PO's starting assumption
is that Horizon works. It habitually looks first for errors
in branch before looking at Horizon. Its contracts with
SPMs are structured to in line with this approach, and
the experience of PO and FJ is that this starting
approach is the right one to take.

o This approach can only be sustained if Horizon is so
reliable to justify a starting, but rebuttable, assumption
that Horizon is accurate.

AC_154286889_1 5

WBD_001292.000005
WBONO001422
WBON0001422

o If Horizon does not meet this bar, then that may require
PO to test the accuracy of Horizon in relation to every
branch shortfall going forward before seeking to
recover any monies.

o It would also pose a risk to its decisions over the last
18 years in relation to the recovery of shortfalls and the
termination of SPMs: which heightens the possibility of
successful claims within the litigation.

e Although this bar is high, Dr Worden has felt comfortable
giving an opinion saying that Horizon is robust and
extremely unlikely to cause shortfalls in branches, which
aligns with Deloitte's earlier work.

Risk 2: Witnesses

e Unlike the Common Issues trial, this trial turns heavily on the
quality of witness evidence.

e In any litigation there is a risk that witnesses may break
under cross examination. That applies to both our evidence
and the Cs’ evidence

e The Two key risk areas are:

o Dr Worden relies on statistical models to show that
incidence of bugs in Horizon is tiny when compared to
the size of the system. Some Judges dislike data and
maths-heavy analysis and so this approach may fall on
deaf ears.

= We have mitigated this risk by ensuring that Dr
Worden also includes a qualitative opinion
alongside his quantitative views.

o The main evidence for Post Office is being given by
technical personnel from FJ. We have encountered
difficulties in the evidence from FJ.

= Ina relatively small number of places, the
evidence has been incorrect and needed to be
corrected through further statements.

AC_154286889_1 6

WBD_001292.000006
WBON0001422
WBON0001422

= We are therefore concerned that under cross-
examination further cracks in FJ's evidence could
be exposed.

= We should make clear that FJ have been very
cooperative — this is not due to a lack of
engagement from them, particularly now.

= The problem is that they are being asked to give
factual evidence on issues that arose years,
sometimes, decades ago on highly technical and
often obscure points. In some cases, the points
they are addressing are hypothetical and so FJ
are having to speculate rather than draw the
answer from first-hand experience.

= This problem is exacerbated by the fact that
several of the points now being emphasised by
Cs’ expert were either only raised or only given
emphasis in the last month or so (ina
supplemental witness statement by Richard Roll,
who worked for FJ about 15 years ago, and in Mr
Coyne’s “supplemental” expert report). For
reasons related to the way in which the Judge has
managed these proceedings, Cs’ case has been a
moving feast. The result is that not all the factual
issues are now in play that were addressed in the
FJ and PO witness statements previously served.

= We have mitigated thatthis through extensive
discussions with FJ, probing their evidence as far
as we can as lawyers with no technical knowledge
and I have even met with FJ direct on a number of
occasions. Nevertheless, it remains a real
concern whether FU's witness will withstand cross-
examination.

= 4rfacttThe sorts of areas where FJ might be
attacked should not, in our view, necessarily lead
to PO’s overall case being undermined. For
example, -if the Judge finds that FJ used its
powers of privileged access to edit or delete
branch data more frequently and with less

AC_154286889_1 7

WBD_001292.000007
WBON0001422
WBON0001422

discipline there is a greater availability of remote
acceess-than FJ previously said, that does not of
itself mean that there were problems with the
Horizon system. So the case does not stand or
fall with the performance of FJs witnesses on
every issue, but it needs to be recognised that if
they perform poorly it gives the Judge a route to
finding against PO if he wants to.

Risk 3: Remote access

e Weaved into the heart of the Cs case is a conspiracy_theory
that PO and FJ are frequently meddling with branch
transaction data in secret and that this is either deliberately
or casually causing falsethe shortfalls to appear in branches.
This has become known as the "remote access" problem.

e The difficulty is that PO's and FJ's case on remote access
has changed over the years.

o During the mediation scheme, FJ advised PO that
remote access was not possible and PO passed that
message on to Second Sight.

o At the end of the mediation scheme, the FJ position
changed to there being a limited capability to add new
transactions to a branch's accounts, but with no
capability to edit or delete existing data.

o Deloitte's work then revealed that the editing or
deleting existing data was possible in certain
circumstances.

o Fujitsu’s witness statements indicate that various forms
of remote access have been and are possible, more
than previously admitted.

o The Cs’ experteyne is now saying that there are even
more ways that data can be edited and deleted —
andtheugh we are still investigating these allegations
with FJ.

e Viewed in its proper context, the fhe Remote Access
problem adds little substance to the basic question whether

AC_154286889_1 8

WBD_001292.000008
WBONO001422
WBON0001422

Horizon is robust. Bbut it dees-gives the Cs lots of
damaging forensic points.

o There is no evidence of wide-spread data manipulation
but there are circumstances where FJ do need to
change se-data to correct problems in the system.

This is normal, but the history of this issue and FJ’s
apparently inability to give even POL a full and account
of the remote access facility and its use feeds Fhese
examplesfeed oxygen to athe conspiracy theory _of
widespread secret meddling.

o Itis ‘s-also-difficult to imagine any rational reason why
FJ would use this capability to maliciously manipulate
branch data, or that it would do that so carelessly to
cause widespread problems.

o But the changing position on FJ's capability to edit and
delete transaction data exposes PO to criticism of
covering up some untoward activity. The Cs will say
that they have had fight to draw out the truth from PO.

o The remote access point can also be used to tarnish
the credibility of FJ's witnesses.

e At trial, this tepic-will attract disproportionate fets-of
attention. Human nature will attract the Judge and the media
to this topic.

e Our approach is that sunlight is the best antiseptic. We
won't be denying the existence of remote access capabilities
but we will be saying that it’s a red herring when it comes to
deciding whether Horizon is robust._But for this purpose, we
are seeking to produce a clear and comprehensive account
of the remote access facilities that have been available to FJ
over the last 18 years. This is not as easy as it we could like

it to be.

WBON0001422

Risk mitigation

e Because of the above risks, we are building risk mitigations
into the legal strategy.

e First, we will are-drawing a clear distinction between the old
version of Horizon; that existed before 2010, and new
Horizon, that is currently in place. Much-eftThe Cs’ -attacks
are mostly on old Horizon. If the Judge were to find that old
Horizon was not robust, then-this would be far from ideal
baectin the context of the litigation but it should cause less
operational disruption to PO as that system is no longer
used.

e Second, where possible, we are laying down markers that
the steps taken to reach this trial were unfair. The Cs have
(again) served evidence that is not consistent with what the
Judge said he wantedinadmissible-and-was-_prohibited by
Gourterder. Mr Coyne's supplemental report effectively
makesraises a whele-new case. With Aa more engaged
and even-handed Judge, -weuld net have-allowed-such
things would not te-have happened. But they have
happened and tthe possibility of appealing the Horizon
Issues judgment is limited. T-with-the only likely ground is
being-pprocedural unfairness and that is a very difficult
ground to make out, particularly in the context of group
litigation, in which Managing Judge’s are expected to
fashion unusual procedures to ensure the swiftest and most
efficient means of resolving the points in dispute.

e Third, we are taking urgent steps to investigate whether we
can produce some short witness evidence addressing some
of the issues which the Cs are now placing emphasis. FJJ
are being cooperative, but this is not an easy or quick
process, we are not yet in a position to determine how
useful it will be and there is no guarantee that the Judge will
allow any further evidence to be adduced.

e Fourth, due to the level of reliance on the quality of witness
testimony, we are planning to only submit short opening
submissions. This then allows us flexibility to adapt our
closing submissions to the quality of evidence given during

AC_154286889_1 10

WBD_001292.000010
WBON0001422
WBON0001422

trial. But this does also come with the risk of criticism by the
Judge that we are not being clear about our case on
awkward issues and/or we-that when we address them
have, we will be raising +aised-new points late in the day.

Conclusion:

e Inconclusion, as matters stand, I believe that the Judge will
likely find that Horizon is a robust system, but that we will
get some criticism about FJ's ability to remotely change data
and about the processes they apply in identifying and fixing
bugs in Horizon. This assessment assumes that FJ can
provide answers to most of Coyne's late attacks.

e The outcome will however turn heavily on what actually
happens at trial with the witnesses perform well or not.

e I will therefore be keeping my assessment of the position
under continuous review over the next few weeks and
during the trial and will flag if I believe the position has
changed.
