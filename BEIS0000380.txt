BA/POCL AUTOMATION PROJECT: DRAFT LETTERS FOR THE
PRIME MINISTER TO SEND TO THE POST OFFICE CHAIRMAN
AND THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF ICL

Jeremy Heywood’s letter of 1 March to Paul Williams recorded the Prime
Minister’s invitation to my Secretary of State to see the Post Office Chairman
on the future of the Horizon project, and indicated that the Prime Minister
would subsequently wish to write to Neville Bain. My Secretary of State’s
minute to the Prime Minister on Friday (5 March), copied to the Chancellor
and the Secretary of State for Social Security, reported that he had now seen
Neville Bain, and promised draft letters for the Prime Minister to send both to
Bain and to Keith Todd of ICL.

I should be grateful for quick comments on either text. I can see some merit

in the Prime Minister writing to ICL at this stage, though the letter from
Jeremy Heywood did not commit the PM to doing so.

David
