Thank you for your letter of 22 November 2000 concerning your client Mr G S Dhillon,
formerly subpostmaster at Fleetdale Parade Sub Post Office.

As I explained in my letter of 10 November to Howard Stoate MP, responsibility for
decisions relating to the day-to-day running of the postal businesses, such as the
contractual terms and arrangements of subpostmasters, including termination of contracts,
rests with Post Office management. It would not therefore be appropriate for me to seek to

intervene in Mr Dhillon’s case.
