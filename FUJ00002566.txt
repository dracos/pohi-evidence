1.3.1

Introduction

1.1

Information Security Definition

Information is an asset which, like other important business assets, has value to an organisation
and consequently needs to be suitably protected. Information security protects information from
a wide range of threats in order to safeguard customers and staff, ensure business continuity,
minimise business damage and maximise operational efficiency.

Information can exist in many forms. It can be printed or written on paper, stored electronically,
transmitted by post or using electronic means, shown on films, or spoken in conversation.
Whatever forms the information takes, or means by which it is shared or stored, it should always
be appropriately protected and is subject to the provisions of this policy document.

Information security is characterised here as the preservation of:

Confidentiality: ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorised to have
access;

Integrity: safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing
methods;

Availability: ensuring that authorised users have access to information and associated
assets when required.

Information security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of countermeasures, including
policies, practices, procedures, organisational structures and technical measures. Therefore by
using an Information Security Management System (ISMS), this provides a systematic approach
to managing sensitive company information so that it remains secure. It also encompasses.
people, processes and IT systems

1.2

Information Security Purpose

The purpose of Information Security Management is to provide an appropriate level of protection
for information assets from relevant threats, whether internal or external, deliberate or

accidental.

The implementation of this policy is important to maintain our integrity as a supplier of services
to stakeholders and to support Post Office Ltd’s (POL) Legal and Regulatory obligations with the
parameters of Fujitsu’s Contractual obligations.

1.3. Information Security Scope

This Information Security Policy specifies mandatory information security requirements to be
applied throughout the Post Office Account (POA) in delivery of its contracted HNG-X Services

to POL.

This Information Security Policy covers all activities undertaken by the POA in the provision of
these services including design, development, integration, deployment, operation and support of
services, as well as the programme management, stakeholder management, governance and
administrative procedures applied by executive management to oversee those services.

Excluded from Scope

Information Security risks within POL sites that are outside of the scope of the Services provided
by the POA are excluded from the scope of this Information Security Policy.
