1.3.2 Business Impact Review

Prior to 3LS passing any resolved incident to 4LS for root cause analysis or code fixing, the peak will be
reviewed by Business Impact Forum to agree that a root cause analysis or a coded fix are required to
maintain the operational service. It is expected that BIF will ensure that a business impact statement is
provided on peak prior to the peak being passed to 4LS.
