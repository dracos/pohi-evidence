Document Title: Group Definitions for the Secure NT Build
Document Type: Requirement Definition
Release: CSR+
Abstract: The ACP requires that access to Pathway systems be

controlled by the use of pre defined roles to which users can
be assigned. Such roles will allow users to access only
those parts of the system, with associated objects, they
need in order to complete the tasks associated with that
particular role. This document summarises this requirement
and defines the roles, with associated objects, domains and
access requirements.

ICL Pathway Group Definitions for the Secure NT Build Ref: RS/REQ/016
Version: 4.0
COMPANY IN CONFIDENCE Date: 06/02/01

1 Introduction

The nature of the Pathway system requires that access to the core systems
should be strictly controlled. [ACP] states that effective control depends on
having a clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of all personnel who
need some form of access to the system. Users will gain access by being
assigned to these roles. This will be core to Pathway implementing the
principles of least privilege.

This document summarises the requirement and defines the human roles that
will be implemented for NT platforms; which objects will be used by each role;
the domains each role will function within; access point for the role; and
associated privileges.

2 Scope

This document addresses the roles to be implemented as part of the Pathway
central NT systems and access rights assigned to each role. Each role within
this document access the datacentre through the Pathway NT Domain
Structure referenced in [NT DOM]. CP2630 removes Roll Out Database and
FRODB domain from the Secure Managed Environment and is now out of
scope.

Roles used by SMC, SMG and Girobank are specifically excluded from this
document as they authenticated on separate NT systems which form part of a
managed service.

Roles used and defined by OSD are described in this document for
completeness. Configuration of these roles in the live estate may be partly
provided by SDU and T&I PIT or completely by OSD.

3 Requirements

The requirement to implement a role based access control system emanates
from [ACP]. [ACP] further defines the roles that are required for access to the
Pathway Systems and the responsibilities of these roles.

It should be noted that the Pathway solution has moved on since Version 2 of
the ACP was issued and, as such, the Groups defined at Appendix A do not
always correlate with the roles defined in [ACP]. This will be addressed by
feeding these role definitions into the current review of the ACP which will be
subject to a CP once all necessary changes have been agreed.

4 Implementation

Each role will be set up as a Group within NT. Individual users will be
assigned to these Groups in which access to objects, domains, servers and

associated privileges will be controlled. These Groups are defined in
Appendix A.

Roles will have defined access points which will have an accompanying
Platform Design Document. Access to objects will be made available to each
role at the relevant access point. This document specifically covers the
Groups accessing the data centres. The Horizon Helpdesk and SMC/SMG
roles are the responsibility of the appropriate managed service for the
provision of suitable client systems compliant to the SFS and ACP.

The definition of the users will be held in a spreadsheet, or similar, and
automated tools will be used for the production of the relevant command
scripts.

Human roles and service users, as defined in this document, will be
implemented using automated command scripts. By doing this, it will simplify
the implementation and maintenance of the roles and service users defined in
Annex A and B. Exceptions to this are those roles within the support
services, ICL Outsourcing and SSC, who will also access toolsets via the
command line. All roles only have authority to access the toolsets specified
in this document.

Human users created from the defined roles may only be members of one
role/Group definition. This is required to ensure the user is only provided
with one appropriate toolset.

Implementation of the toolsets for the ICL Outsourcing roles will be the
responsibility of the managed service and profiles will be set up locally on the
NT client. In these instances there will be no user profile on the PDC.

Implementation of the menu structure for each Group will ensure that users
assigned to that Group will be able to access the application set necessary
for them to fulfil their duties. Not all tools will be available through a direct
menu option; for example, Business Objects Universes will be accessed via a
Business Object menu option. The Business Objects Administrator will be
responsible for allocating the appropriate universes to users. Those ‘tools’
prefixed with ‘>’ will not typically be assigned as a menu option through the
PDC.

NT Administrator User

The Windows NT operating system is provided with a super user known as
the ‘Administrator’. This user has full administration and configuration
privileges which is exercised at both system/server and domain level. This
capability cannot be removed from Windows NT. Pathway recognises the
power that this user has and the ability that a human user, using the
administrator user, has to interfere with the day to day operation of the
Pathway solution.

To address this issue, Pathway will limit and restrict the use of the NT
Administrator User. This will be achieved by:

> Renaming the Administrator User on all NT Servers so that it is hidden
from the system. The account name and password will be specified by the

FUJ00232472

Version: 4.0
COMPANY IN CONFIDENCE Date: 06/02/01

Pathway Security Manager, which will be strictly controlled and stored in a
secure safe.

> Restrict full administrator privileges to the ‘Operational Management’ role.
Use of this role will be subject to the management and procedural controls
set out in the ‘Pathway Code of Practice’, PA/STD/010.

5 Notes that apply to Annex A

Those ‘tools’ prefixed with ‘>’ will not be assigned as a menu option from the
users workstation/access point. Instead the tool will be made available to the
user from the Command Line.

The term NT Resource Kit will mean the full complement of NT Resource Kit
utilities will be made available to the user role.

The term NT Resource Kit* {Toolname} will mean only the specific Resource
Kit utility or utilities specified by {Toolname} will be made available to the user
role.

The term NT Server Tools will mean the default Administrative Tools
(Common) executables delivered with the NT Operating System.
