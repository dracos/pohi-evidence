Key points from Second Sight meeting:

e Nothing particularly new came up — no startling new accusations (from my point of
view anyway — there were some that BNR had not heard before)

e Interesting snippets include:

oc Ron Warmington used to work with former POL GC Susan Crichton at GE —
that is how they were introduced to JA

0. SS link the “change in approach” by POL to Crichton’s departure (in
November 2013 according to LinkedIn)

0°. Slight dig at how POL are “on their third or fourth GC since Crichton left”

olan Henderson worked for the CCRC for 4 years. Said they take a very narrow
and technical view of miscarriages of justice.

e RW went to great pains to emphasise how sceptical JFSA were of them to start with
and how important it was to “carry JFSA with them” if the investigation was to be
worthwhile.

e SS think that POL has poor corporate governance because it has no shareholders
except Government and we don’t scrutinise it enough

e Think that POL prosecutors are guilty of misconduct in a number of cases (not
following Crown Code etc)

e No mention at all of actual flaws in the system (other than things that “could have
been better” and “took a long time to fix”). Mostly focused on POL’s behaviour. Very
strong against POL.

Readout I gave POL (I agreed the thrust of this with BNR’s office) was:

e Anumber of issues were discussed, none of which were new or would surprise you

e BNR recommended they meet Tim Parker and they agreed to do that

e SS were positive about Tim Parker and we got the sense they would engage
constructively with him

e I thought the meeting went as well as could be expected

e BNR seems in a good place — the meeting did not cause any wobbles, and she seems
reassured that she has done what she needs to and can now leave this to Tim, CCRC
and mediation.
