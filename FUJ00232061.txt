Gents

Current charge for an ARQ is approx £180 (covers 1-31 days of data) so based on this cost 7 years would = approx £15K
based on our standard service charges

For the previous submission of CT1147 we dropped this to approx £6k

There is a lot of work required for this amount of data and so I personally would not like to drop much less than 3K per
outlet — my own view obviously

I have also attached a draft doc for it — will need the cost bit doing once you have decided on it — or please feel free to
bung in the recycle bin - ©

Cheers
