Alwen will do a note of the meeting for you and attach, on a personal basis, a document which JA gave me.
I won't duplicate that but would like to talk to you about this once you've had a chance to read them and
what follows.

I think JA genuinely wants to seek a resolution to the difficulties concerned and is willing to believe
that we will do the right things. There is a real prize for us in finding an effective way of convincing
him and his fellow MPs that things are as they should be. He believes that this would quieten down
Private Eye and would prevent proposed escalation eg adjournment debate etc. To do this, we might
commission a new independent review of the Horizon related questions (my thought) or invite him
accompanied by someone from Computer Weekly to visit the Model office and be shown how Horizon works (his
suggestion) or something else altogether.

I promised to go back to him once I had had the chance to consider all this. I would like to do so by
Easter, or at least have fixed a further meeting by then.

I am asking Glenda to set up a meeting to discuss this amongst ourselves in the next couple of weeks.

All the best

Alice
