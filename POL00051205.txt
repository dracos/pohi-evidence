POST OFFICE LIMITED v PETER ANTHONY HOLMES
GOSFORTH MAGISTRATES COURT - 30™ MARCH 2009 AT 10AM
CASE NO: POLTD/0809/0128

I have sent Instructions to Messrs McKenzie Bell & Sons, Solicitors of 19 John
Street, Sunderland SR1 1JG (Tel.No.0191 567 4857) to prosecute on behalf of
Post Office Limited and to inform the Court that the Prosecution considers the case to
be more suitable for trial on Indictment.

If Not Guilty pleas are entered, I shall inform you and would ask that you please
prepare, as advised on 16" February 2009, one set of typed copies of statements and
exhibits together with typed draft lists of statements and exhibits. The papers must be
sent to this Office at least 21 days before the proposed committal proceedings.

In the event that you have informed me whether there is any material which might
reasonably be considered capable of undermining the Prosecution case or assisting
the Defence case, please let me know as soon as possible and please also provide
Forms CSO06C, D and E duly completed. I shall prepare Form 14A to accompany the
committal papers.

If you wish me to apply for Investigation costs please let me have the amount in due
course.
