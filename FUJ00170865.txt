Andrew

I spoke to you briefly about this at Bradford. Nothing has been received from Andy I.

It may be that he

has sent it to the Guildhall as that was the last communication address he had for me but I have asked for it to be sent to

Springburn.
Can you assist in contacting Andy as this is urgently required by the PF.
Regards
Robert

Hi Andy

Please find attached a schedule 8 certificate in relation to the CD you provided me with for Craigton Post Office last year.
The case currently sits with the Procurator Fiscal in Scotland who has instructed me to complete schedule 8 certificates for all
productions (exhibits). As the data for Craigton was downloaded on to a CD and produced by yourself I need you to sign and

date the attached certificate.

Can you print it off, sign, date and post back to myself at the address below.

Any queries please give me a call.
Regards
Robert
