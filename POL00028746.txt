[Start of Response]

n 02-Jun-04, user SMUOO1 carried out a Transfer Out [T0] txns on counter one
jand left the session running, therefore Automatic system logout occurred. It
jappears that the system did not complete the txn tidily after the forced
logout which occurs after 55 minutes of activity
Is a result, the selected transfer could not be completed, as it was
perceived by the system as currently being processed by another user, i.e.
lsmuoo1.
leven though user ASU001 appears to have TI the txn, in actual fact the

riginal TO txns were still outstanding until the original user, SMU001
transferred them, TI. Investigation continues..

It attempted to call the 2M at 18:05 but there was no reply. SMC please
update the PM when s/he next call in.

lll nodes were connected at the time that the TransferIn txns were attempted
io session transfers took place during that day.

leventlog from node 4 suggests that Riposte replication had not been
successful and so while node 3 had successfully TI the txns, this information

jas not apparent to node 4 thus it was perceived by node 4 that those txns
ere outstanding waiting to be TI. Therefore when the user SMU001 logged
nto node 4, he was presented with Outstanding Transfer message which had to
e accepted or declined. The user chose to accept them even though he tells
@ that at this stage he was a little concerned because he was certain that
luser ASUO10 had already TI on node 3. This has created a discrepancy on
their Cash Account £22,290.00. Also the Host has reported a reconciliation
error in TPSC256 for £44,580.00.

lapparently the discrepancy will keep appearing each week until the amount is
committed to the Suspense Account. There is little point in Development
trying to manually tweak the messagestore to remove this problem as the
Jiamage was done when the first discrepancy was accepted. Now the problem is
isible it should be dealt with in the Suspense Account.

t'11 transfer the call to Martin for him to clarify where necessary. Martin
can you return Advice and Guidance please.

attached will be a spreadsheet and the set of transactions that I think are
responsible for the error. The spreadsheet is ALL transactions that account
to StockUnit BB and I have presented a data view for the discrepancies
committed. I do not even know if I am expected to be doing a summary
linpsection nevertheless the attached give a 'view' as stated.

lds far as the system is concerned, there seems to be a flaw in riposte
informing Counter 4 that the transfer object BB-1-492803 has been erased.
This is an Escher Riposte problem as far as I concerned, the transfer
echanism already has a belt and braces approach, if we can't trust the
nderlying software to replicate this information through to all other
counters, what are we supposed to be able to do? If someone wants to press
for a fix, I suggest this is pointed at the Escher team for them to sort out.

Please see earlier evidence and comments on this bug. I think a third party

should verify the amounts etc. that may be sanctioned as the Stockunit being
jactually out by, I'm not sure the PM will be happy with what I've presented ,
ut I can only go on what I have found.

Problem could have been avoided if the PM had not accepted the second TI.

fhe Riposte Error events were apparent on SMC's Tivoli Website, however, they
took no action until the PM raised a call about the dodgy Transfers. In
future, SMC would need to monitor these events and contact the office
requesting that they avoid using the eventing Node and reboot it.

I've checked with Mike King; the BIMS report for this problem was sent to POL
n 22/6 and should have resulted in an error notice being sent to the branch.
ike says he will send a note to POL saying that the PM has been chasing this
issue; I've asked HSH to inform the PM that they should have received an
error notice and to check with the department that issues them.

fhe corrected cash account that was sent still had an R&P mismatch. The
Jiouble Transfer In causes a mismatch both because of the transfer and because
lof the discrepancy which has been erroneously generated. The host-calculated
A ignores the transfer but is still affected by the accepted discrepancy
hich should not have been generated. It is not really possible to provide a
fully balanced CA (email on this subject sent by Mik Peach to Richard
Brunskill then on to John Moran, I have not seen the outcome of this)
