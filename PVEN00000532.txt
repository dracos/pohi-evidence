Paula,
Am just back in the U.K.

What | have learned from inquiry /
Parliamentary

committee ..questions is very
damaging.

Nick was a poor witness.
Chairman gone. He will be next.

When it was clear the system was
at fault, the PO should have raised
ared flag, stopped all proceedings,
given people back their money and
then tried to compensate them for
the ruin this caused in their lives.

| think you knew..

No Moya, that isn't the case.

| want to believe you.

| asked you twice. | suggested you
get an indépendant review
reporting to you. | was afraid you
were being lied to.

You said system had already been
reviewed multiple times.

How could you not have known?

Moya, the mechanism for getting to
the bottom of this is the Inquiry. I've

made it my priority to support it
fully.

Delivered

The Post Office did not.. they
dragged their heels,, they did not
deliver docs, they did not
compensate people .

Paula.. you appealed the Judges
decision!

lam sorry.. | can't now support you

| have supported you

All these years..

to my own detriment.

| can’t support you now
After what | have learned
