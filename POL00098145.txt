Simon,

Happy in the main but I would like confirmation from Gareth that the system details a gain in the week in question.

Thanks,
Angela

Simon,
Angelia made 3 comments which I have responses for:

1. AVi: “What does this mean? Is there anything on the system/logs that tracks from a gain to a loss?” where
“this” is “the Discrepancy committed to the accounts”

When a Stock Unit is Balanced, a check is made as to any Discrepancy between the system derived Cash Figure
{calculated by adding up all the Cash movements since the last Balance) and the Cash Declaration (that has to be
done as part of the Balancing process). if they differ, then a transaction is generated to alter the system Cash
figure to match the Declaration. In order to maintain the double entry, then the balancing transaction is posted
to a “Discrepancy account”. There are actually 2 Discrepancy accounts — one for gains and one for losses
{products 145 and 222).

When the SU is rolled into a new TP, then the Discrepancy Account is cleared by generating a transaction such
that the nett value of the sum of 145 and 222 is zero, with the Balancing transaction being written to the Local

suspense account.

When the final SU in the Branch is Balances the SPMR is required to Clear the Local Suspense account by either
making good or Settling Centrally.

All these transactions are visible in the system logs. The Discrepancies are written in Mode 17 (DDP}, while Local
Suspense transactions are in Mode 15 (Housekeeping).

So are we saying that there was a corresponding gain (albeit not the exact amount but in the range) in the same
week?

2. AV2: “What evidence is there that this LTSB card is a credit card?”
i did not intend to suggest it was. What I arn trying to say here is that there is nothing to indicate an attempt to
use a Card as a method of Payment. I have also observed that for a BT Bill only a Debit Card would have been

acceptable.

Had a card been attempted as a MoP, then even had it failed, a transaction would have been recorded in the
logs. There is not such record.

POL-0097728
POLO0098145
POL00098145

Whether it was a Credit or a debit card is not really relevant as there is no sign of any card being used.
Apologies I've misread — but it is now clear that there is no logged attempt to use a card as MOP.
3. AV3: “How do we know that these LTSB cards aren’t one and the same thing?”

ican only see the use of a single card and that was used as a banking Withdrawal. The SPMR has stated that
there was an initial attempt to use it as a MoP and that is not substantiated by the Logs.

The Logs show the first 6 digits of the PAN which enables me to check with reference data what type of Card it
is. This confirms that the card used for the banking withdrawal was a LTSB card and also that it could be used as

a Debit card.

However there were other customers where this did happen and it is possible (or even probable) that he didn’t
recall the precise sequence of events as it was some time later that he made the complaint.

Hopefully that clarifies Angela’s questions. The second relate to section 6 point 1 of the report which although factually
correct are probably not too relevant to the overall report.

Regards

Gareth

This isn’t quite ready to release out for Susan, Alwen and your approval which is the last step before releasing to second
sight, but as you have been involved in this case, I wanted to give you a heads-up for your early comment.
