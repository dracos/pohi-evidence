Dear Nick ,

Thank you for forwarding your letter to Alex Chalk as requested . I was surprised to read it
following our conversations that we would not become involved in any way in what is a very
difficult decision for Government and our justice system .

You say that we are not making a value judgement but then attach a letter from our lawyers
which makes the statement " It is highly likely that the vast majority (..... of Post Masters )
who have not yet appealed were in fact guilty as charged ". If that is not a value judgement I
do not know what is . He also makes another value judgement that no one would have a more
generous approach than POL - a view I would not share based on my assessment of our past
behaviour .

A third party would see this letter as Post Office's lawyers " continuing to defend the
indefensible " ," Post Office has not changed " etc . That assessment of others would do a
huge disservice to the efforts of the current Board and management team as we seek to
accelerate justice and generosity for wronged Post Masters .

Please ring me over the weekend to discuss .

Henry
