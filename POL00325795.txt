Andrew,

This is something which we should discuss carefully. I'm afraid the position is rather complicated
and the proposed approach gives rise to enormous risks. Any potential admission of liability will
create potential problems with defendants unhappy with their conviction, sentence and
confiscation order. I think it would be a good idea to have a conference at 148 Old Street early next
week,

Jarnail, Could a conference be accommodated at short notice?

Kind regards,

Martin.

Martin

In a number of cases investigated so far, Post Office believe (in hindsight) that they could have spotted a SPMR's
problems early. For example, where losses were prevalent over long periods or losses were escalating; or where the
cash position in the branch was clearly far too low or high compared to the cash demands of the branch.

In these cases, Post Office is considering accepting some fault (ie. if POL had intervened earlier the losses may have
been less). This would not of course the excuse the underlying misfeasance / negligence that led to the losses in the
first place: it is more about stopping the losses escalating earlier.

I appreciate that this is a very broad hypothetical question but. do you think this could or would cause a criminal /
prosecution risk?

My (completely novice!) initial view is that if a SPMR commits false accounting or theft, the "amount" of that false
accounting or theft does not affect the conviction (but I guess could have an impact on sentence).

Happy to discuss.

Kind regards
Andy
