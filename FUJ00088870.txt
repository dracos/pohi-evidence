FUJITSU Data Centre Operations Service: Service Description
FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

1 Service Summary

14 The Data Centre Operations Service consists of three (3) component services:

a) the Data Centre Operations Service — this service is described in sections 2 and 3 of this
document;

b) the AP Client File Re-Send Service — this service component of the Data Centre
Operations Service is described in Annex A: PODG Client File Re-Send Service of this
document;

c) POLSAP Service — this service component of the Data Centre Operations Service is
described in Annex B: POLSAP Service of the document.

1.2 The Data Centre Operations Service is responsible for the provision of all Data Centre
operations, which includes, for example; all the agents, servers, and databases used to
manage and support the Branch Infrastructure and HNG-X Central Infrastructure used to
deliver the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities irrespective of technology platform or
geographical location.

1.3 The primary elements of the Data Centre Operations Service cover the day to day
management and operational control of the Data Centre environments located in the live Data
Centre and the Disaster Recovery (DR) Data Centre applying ITIL best practice within these
environments.

14 Operational staff will be appropriately trained to carry out the Data Centre Operations Service
process, which includes monitoring capability within each of the respective Data Centres to an
agreed level.

1.5 The Data Centre Operations Service provides on-site operational support in order to identify /

minimise interruptions to the HNG-X Services provided by Fujitsu Services.

1.6 The management of the Data Centres shall be aligned with the operational requirements
within the Branch Infrastructure.

1.7 Changes to the Data Centre environments shall be made without impacting the live service
and in accordance with Fujitsu Services’ corporate working practices and operational
standards. No changes will be carried out within the Data Centre without an approved change
record.

18 The Data Centre Operations Service shall be fully compliant with the security management
standards and policies and follow approved procedures as set out within the Contract
Controlled Document (CCD) entitled: “Security Management Service, Service Description”
(SVM/SDM/SD/0017).

1.9 The live Data Centre will run in an active / DR mode with the DR Data Centre being used for
testing. The live Data Centre (including the communications in and out of the building) is, in
its own right, fully resilient. There are single high capacity network links in each data centre.
Resilience is achieved by triangulation, for example, of the single network link into the live
Data Centre fails then traffic will use the single high capacity link into the DR Data Centre and
traverse the inter campus link. Also many network components are active / active across the
data centres. Business Continuity testing is completed during the week (Monday to Friday) for
a maximum of two (2) weeks per year, during which operational testing will not take place at
the DR Data Centre.

1.10 Notwithstanding any provision in any Schedule, CCD or CRD to the contrary, for the POLSAP
Service, Fujitsu Services shall provide the Application Support Service (Fourth Line) in
respect of the POLSAP Service.

2.3.2 Service Level Relief

The “HNGX Capacity Management and Business Volumes” (PA/PER/033) sets out the limits
(the Contracted Volume) which, if exceeded over a monthly period, will entitle Fujitsu
Services to adjust the measurement of performance in respect of the Data Centre Operations
Service SLT’s, and Liquidated Damages Targets (LDT's) if applicable and affected by this
excess. Such adjustments shall be made on the following basis:

1.

a)

b)

Fujitsu Services shall identify, for joint consideration with Post Office, any failure to
achieve the Data Centre Operations Service SLT’s and / or LDT’s within the month
due to the limits being exceeded. Post Office and Fujitsu Services (acting
reasonably) will agree the reasons for that SLT or LDT failure if it has been caused
or contributed to by Fujitsu Services:

if the SLT or LDT failure occurs as a result of a Default by Fujitsu Services, no
adjustment shall be made to the performance measurements for the affected SLT’s or
LDT’s in respect of that month;

if the SLT or LDT failure is agreed to be as a result of the limits being exceeded, the
performance measurements for the affected SLT’s and LDT’s in respect of that month
shall be reported as reasonably required by the Parties;

Following each Service Level Measurement Period, Post Office and Fujitsu
Services will assess whether, on average during the relevant Service Level
Measurement Period, any of the limits have been exceeded by 10% (ten per cent)
or more. In making that assessment, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall
consider the cause of any daily peaks in excess of the daily averages during the
relevant Service Level Measurement Period and disregard the measurements in
respect of those days where the peaks have arisen as a result of a Fujitsu Services
Default. If, having made this assessment, Post Office and Fujitsu Services agree
that a limit has been exceeded by 10% (ten per cent) and within any three (3)
consecutive months, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall meet to discuss, (acting
reasonably) any appropriate changes to the applicable Data Centre Operations
Service SLT’s and LDT’s; and

Any dispute between Post Office and Fujitsu Services arising in connection with the
application of this section 2.3.2 of this Data Centre Operations Service, Service
Description shall be resolved in accordance with the Dispute Resolution Procedure.

2.3.3 Rectification Plan

5.2.7 Resilience

The PODG service is configured on two pairs of servers (PODGe and PODGi).

Within a datacentre each server is deployed on a blade in a blade server. The blade server
provides resilience to a single blade failure. If a blade on which PODG is running fails then
the blade server will automatically restart the PODG instance on a different blade.

To provide resilience against major failures one pair of servers is located in each datacentre.
Only one pair of servers is running the live service at any one time.

The data storage used by the PODG service is mirrored between the two data centres. Data is
automatically synchronised between the mirror copies.

In the event of a site failover, the IP addresses advertised by PODGe to Post Office clients
for incoming connections are unchanged.

5.2.8 Business Continuity

The PODG service is deployed in the Fujitsu data centres.
The PODG service is configured with:

« — The primary PODG service in the IRE11 data centre and a standby PODG service in the
IRE19 data centre;

* The PODG data storage is synchronised between the IRE11 and IRE19 data centres;

e The Fujitsu Services data centre network infrastructure, including the internet and ISDN
network services in both the IRE11 and IRE19 data centres.

In the event of a Major Business Continuity Incident (MBCI) with potential impact on business
continuity of the PODG service then the standard Fujitsu Services business continuity plan
(HNG-X Services Business Continuity Plan (SVM/SDM/PLA/0002)) will be invoked.

If there is a failure in the live (IRE11) datacentre, and Disaster Recovery is invoked, then the
PODG service will be operational from the standby datacentre (IRE19) within 5 hours of
approval for invoking datacentre disaster recovery being given by Post Office Limited (see
also section 2.9 Business Continuity).

5.2.9 Service Levels or Targets

There are no contractual service levels or targets for the PODG service.

Fujitsu Services Post Office Account shall use reasonable commercial endeavours to meet
the operational targets documented in the Operational Level Agreement between Fujitsu
Services Post Office Account and Post Office Limited for the Post Office Data Gateway

cover) the period of waiting for Royal Mail to commence investigation and resolution activities
that falls within the Collect & Return Service hours will not be counted against the KPI's for
availability or incident resolution.

e KPI measurements are suspended in the event of a disaster being declared and the disaster
recovery process being invoked.

e Inthe event of a disaster KPI calculations will only be resumed once the Collect & Return
Service has been restored to normal operation.

« Where an emergency period of service outage has been agreed in advance with Post Office and
Royal Mail and takes place within the supported hours of operation, this period will not count
towards the availability KP! calculation.

e The KPI's identified only apply within the hours of 08.00hrs to 18.00hrs Monday to Friday and
08:00hrs to 13:00hrs on Saturday’s excluding Bank Holidays.

e Service availability is calculated using complete loss of service periods during the supported
hours of operation, ignoring any loss of service which has been pre-agreed with Post Office and
Royal Mail for application of an emergency changes and ignoring any period in which a disaster
has been declared and the service is not operating from the prime data centre.

e The calculation of resolution times for incidents is based on the supported hours of service. For
example a severity 3 incident reported at 15.00hrs on a Wednesday will be regarded as fixed
within target time if it is resolved before 15.00hrs on the following business day.
