When we know the likely audit date Denise will have a conversation with David Sears to put some
feelers out.

Lin,

Do we have anyone that you know who would be likely to take it on as a Temp, would it be worth
speaking to them now unofficially, we do not have to name the branch

Tony
I think this is only a matter of time — he owes about £35k in rent at Winsford, not sure about Wells.
We'll see what the audits bring but we may need to have contingencies lined up to maintain service.

Hi Lin et al,

End of last year we agreed to pay grant an Overscale of 1k per month for the next 6 months. He has
now called me again saying that he had the bailiffs in and they were demanding money from him for

outstanding rent (I understand he owes a whole years rent). He managed to get rid of the bailiffs by

paying them 4k, 2 he had and the other 2 he borrowed.

Sufficed to say grant needs more than 1k and has asked if perhaps we could pay him 20k per year. I
have asked him to provide me with some data and the exact figure he needs in order to run the branch
as there is no point in providing him 20 and then 3 months down the line he rings saying he needs
more. My reasons for asking him this is not so much as I am being generous but more to the point that
I want to know if it would be better for us to get a temp in

I am becoming deeply concerned since he has also said he is sleeping in the branch and his wife has
had to return to her mums as they could no longer afford to pay the rent.

Andrew, I really don’t think Grant would put his hand in the till but I feel it would not be right if I did not
bring this to your attention; I think this branch does warrant an audit for our peace of mind if for nothing
else.

Thanks and look forward to yours views.

Can you confirm whether you have recently had any contact with Grant Allen from the above branch
regarding an overscale request / payment?

Thanks
