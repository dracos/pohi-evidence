Witness Statement

and 5B, MC Rules 1981, r 70)

Statement of Nigel ALLEN

Age if under 18 Over 18 (If over 18 insert ‘over 18’)

This statement (consisting of one page signed by me) is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and I
make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it
anything, which I know to be false or do not believe true.

Dated the 25 Day of June 2007

Further to my previous statement I would now like to add the following

When an applicant is interviewed for the position of Subpostmaster they would be offered the
normal training package. In cases where the applicant is an existing Subpostmaster, or an
assistant who is experienced, then the training would still be offered, but in the vast majority of
cases, applicants will only ask for training on any areas where they feel it is necessary. As the
Requirements For Incoming Subpostmasters form (Item Ref NA/01) indicates that no training
is required, I can only assume that Mrs Hamilton declined the offer of additional training,
presumably due to the fact that she had been running the branch, and doing the balancing, on

behalf of the previous nominee Subpostmaster, for a fair period of time.
