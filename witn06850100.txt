                                                            Dated: 29 December 2023

                        POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




           FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF DONNA MARIA MUNRO




I, MS DONNA MARIA MUNRO, will say as follows:

Introduction

1. I am a former employee of Fujitsu Services Limited ("Fujitsu"), having left the

   business in 2015.


2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the

   "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request provided to me on 29

   November 2023 (the "Request"), to the extent I have or had direct knowledge of

   such matters. My long-term and short-term recollection has been affected by

   recent medical issues, and I have very limited recollection of the events covered in

   the Request. For this reason, the content of my witness statement largely focusses

   on the documents provided to me by the Inquiry. Where I have referred to

   documents which have assisted my response, the URNs of the relevant documents

   are set out in this statement.


3. I was assisted in preparing this statement by Morrison Foerster, who represent

   Fujitsu in the Inquiry.

                                                                                    WI TN06850100




Professional Background


4. Prior to joining Fujitsu, I worked for a technology company processing orders,

   providing customer support and performing general administrative tasks.


5. I believe I joined Fujitsu in or around 2001 as a Systems Management Centre

   ("SMC") Technician in the Royal Mail Group Account team ("RMG Account").

   However, I have been shown a Powerhelp call log which I opened on 15 December

   2000, which suggests I must have started my role at Fujitsu in at least December

   2000 ([FUJ00144084]). The SMC conducts Fujitsu's internal monitoring of the

   Horizon system and operates 24 hours a day, every day.


6. My recollection of what this role involved is very limited due to the reasons set out

   above. I recall that I was part of the team that was responsible for monitoring the

   rollout of the Horizon system through management of calls from Post Office

   branches in relation to the remote upgrades deployed to Horizon counters. This

   involved ensuring that Horizon counters within specific offices were deployed or

   rolled back on time. If an issue arose, I would refer to the known error log ("KEL")

   and/or engage the Software Support Centre ("SSC") and/or Management Systems

   Support ("MSS") to resolve the issue. As part of the SMC, I was also responsible

   for monitoring alerts of the Tivoli system for error messages produced by branch

   counters and back-end systems.


7. I did not receive formal training for this role, however on-the-job training was

   delivered by experienced senior team members. Due to the passage of time, I

   cannot recall the names of these individuals, but I do recall that Horizon system




                                      Page 2 of 18
                                                                                         WI TN06850100
                                                                                       WI TN06850100




   architects Ian Bowen and Glen Stephens would also assist with the team's

   technical knowledge and understanding of the solutions used for raised issues.


8. I progressed to SMC Team Leader, responsible for management and workload

   distribution of six individuals in the team. I cannot recall specifically when I

   progressed to this role, but I think it is likely to have been at least one year after I

   joined Fujitsu. In 2005, I left the RMG Account team to support different projects

   across the Fujitsu business.


9. In or around June 2009 I was offered the role of Security Operations Manager in

   Fujitsu's Post Office Account team (the "PO Account"). This was a start-up role in

   the team which I believe I was offered given my experience in differing roles within

   Fujitsu. I did not have much experience within Security at the start of my role, and

   I raised this with the PO Account Manager, Peter Thompson. He and the Chief

   Information Security Officer ("CISO") offered support throughout my role. The role

   of CISO was held by various individuals across my time on the PO Account,

   including Tom Lillywhite, Howard Pritchard and Brad Warren.


10.On joining the PO Account, my main focus was on gaining an understanding of

   how the teams worked. I reviewed a number of the services provided by the

   Security team, including access control (implementing a joiner leavers movers

   process), Security clearances, patch management/monitoring, antivirus updates,

   and reconciliation services (the "Reconciliation Service"). I reviewed the

   documentation in place for each of these services and where appropriate produced

   work instructions for each process, including how and why each task was

   performed. The purpose of such work instructions was to ensure that any team

   member, after initial in-house training, could follow the instructions to complete the



                                       Page 3 of 18

                                                                                 WI TN06850100




   task. An index of these documents was kept. [FUJ00088799] is an example of a

   work instruction I prepared for the User Access Process and documents how the

   Security team gained access to physical and technical assets within the PO

   Account.


11.The Inquiry has referred me to document [FUJ00230968] which includes an email

   from myself to Penny Thomas, Andy Dunks and Rajbinder Bains on 9 February

   2011, requesting they each populate a Security Operations document index with

   the processes for which they were responsible. This is an example of how I

   performed the role described at paragraph 10 above.


12.The Security team also offered litigation and/or fraud support services (the

   "Litigation Support Service") to Post Office Limited ("POL"). Documentation for

   the Litigation Support Service was established prior to my joining the PO Account.

   The Inquiry has referred me to documents [FUJ00152221] and [FUJ00152225],

   which are examples of this documentation, which was produced, well-maintained

   and updated appropriately by Penny Thomas, the Subject Matter Expert ("SME").

   I made no amendments to these documents during my time working on the PO

   Account.


13.1 was also responsible for management of the Security team, including sickness,

   leave and performance monitoring, and workload distributions.


14. In my day-to-day work I reported directly to Peter Thompson in relation to PO

   Account services and there was an open line of communication between us. I

   would report my daily activities, changes I planned to implement, and any team

   issues. I also maintained a working relationship with the CISO and would reach out




                                    Page 4 of 18

                                                                                   WI TN06850100




   to him for questions relating to more technical/security matters of the work carried

   out by the Security team.


15. From 2012, my focus moved to supporting the Payment Card Industry Data

   Security Standards ("PCI DSS") compliance programme, though I still maintained

   an oversight of the Security team. Initially, I supported Bill Membery (Quality and

   Compliance Manager, PO Account) in the assessment of the programme, and later

   I took on responsibility of the PCI DSS work, working alongside the support teams,

   the PCI Qualified Security Assessor and POL's representative, Connie Penn, to

   understand the programme's compliance requirements. I organised interviews with

   each of the aforementioned teams to evidence that the compliance requirements

   of the PCI DSS programme had been met.


16. 1 left Fujitsu in 2015 to take up a role as a PCI DSS consultant within another

   company. Since then, I have completed several PCI DSS qualifications and

   attained the ISO 27001 Lead Auditor certification.


Other Fujitsu employees

17. In my role as Security Operations Manager, I was line manager to the SME

   responsible for the management and carrying out of the extraction of audit data

   ("ARQ data"). When I joined the PO Account team, Penny Thomas held this role,

   supported by Andy Dunks. Rajbinder Bains joined the team a few months later.


18. As SME, Penny Thomas was responsible for the provision of the Litigation Support

   Service and supported the Reconciliation Service. She was supported by the SSC

   (including Anne Chambers) and Gareth Jenkins as and when required.

                                                                                   WI TN06850100




19. In the day-to-day performance of her role, Penny Thomas reported to the PO

   Account Manager and the CISO, rather than to me. As her line manager, I was

   copied into some of Penny Thomas' email correspondence so that I could

   understand and manage the resourcing levels and capacity of the team. Penny

   Thomas also liaised directly with POL in the performance of her role as their direct

   point of contact for the Litigation Support Service. From memory and review of the

   documentation, Penny Thomas would occasionally copy me into email

   correspondence with POL so that I had visibility of her capacity. Penny Thomas

   would only reach out to me for assistance in relation to the Litigation Support

   Service for things like arranging cover when she was away, as I managed the team

   workloads. I do not recall Penny Thomas raising concerns relating to the service

   itself, as these would normally be raised with the PO Account Manager or CISO. I

   did not offer subject matter support to the Litigation Support Service.


20. Penny Thomas provided training in all areas of the Litigation Support Service and

   Reconciliation Service, to Rajbinder Bains and Andy Dunks. Penny Thomas also

   trained in the other areas of the Security services. The aim of training both

   Rajbinder Bains and Andy Dunks was to ensure that the Litigation Support Service

   and Reconciliation Service would continue to function even if a member of the team

   was absent.


21.1 believe that Gareth Jenkins was a Senior Solution Architect for the Horizon

   system. He assisted Penny Thomas in understanding the ARQ data she retrieved

   as part of the Litigation Support Service and I believe he was, on occasion, called

   as an expert witness in prosecutions conducted by POL. I did not work with Gareth




                                     Page 6 of 18
                                                                                       WI TN06850100
                                                                                     WI TN06850100




   Jenkins on a technical basis, and only spoke with him on a rare occasion, briefly

   saying hello' around the office.


22.Anne Chambers worked in the SSC providing third- and fourth-line support to the

   Horizon system. I recall one occasion where she assisted Penny Thomas with her

   understanding of ARQ data retrieved as part of the Litigation Support Service, and

   I assume this will have been a similar type of support to that offered by Gareth

   Jenkins, though I am uncertain of any further details of this occasion. I did not work

   with Anne Chambers on a regular basis in relation to Security operations. I began

   to work with Anne Chambers and the SSC on a more frequent basis when I joined

   the PCI DSS compliance programme in 2012. This would have been regarding the

   requirements and controls needed as part of audits.


23.Andy Dunks was the Crypto Key Manager for the team and provided Security

   Analyst support to Penny Thomas. The Crypto Key Manager was responsible for

   the renewal of counter encryption keys, a secure process carried out by two Key

   Custodians and overseen by a third person, who I believe needed to be a team

   manager or alike. From recollection, on my joining of the Security team there was

   no clear work instruction in place for this process. Therefore, I worked through the

   process step-by-step and documented the work instructions. I was a Key

   Custodian alongside Andy Dunks. In the day-to-day performance of his role, Andy

   Dunks would report to me.


24. Rajbinder Bains joined the PO Account Security team in 2009 with a focus on

   access control and anti-virus clearances. She also provided Security Analyst

   support to Penny Thomas after training as described above. In the day-to-day

   performance of her role, Rajbinder Bains would report to me.

                                                                                  WI TN06850100




25.At a high level, I was aware of the process the team carried out to extract ARQ

   data. The team worked in a secure room to access the audit servers via the audit

   workstation and would extract the ARQ data requested by POL. If required, the

   team would produce a corresponding witness statement in respect of how the ARQ

   data was gathered. The team were responsible for providing the ARQ data and

   witness statements to POL. If required, they could also be asked to present this

   evidence at court. I understood that the extraction of ARQ data was a contractual

   requirement of Fujitsu's relationship with POL.


26. 1 did not have any role in the extraction of ARQ data, provision of witness

   statements or the legal proceedings which followed. As mentioned above, Penny

   Thomas reported directly to the PO Account Manager and CISO in regard to

   matters of the Litigation Support Service, including in circumstances where issues

   needed to be escalated. As her line manager, I would be copied for awareness of

   potential resourcing impacts, as in documents [FUJ00154969] and [FUJ00225720]

   referred to me by the Inquiry.


Relationship with Post Office Limited (POL)

27.Throughout my role as Security Operations Manager, I attended monthly meetings

   with the CISO and POL's Senior Security Manager, Dave King, to discuss Security

   activities. At the monthly meetings, Fujitsu and POL would agree a Security report.

   Due to the passage of time, I cannot now recall the usual contents of this report,

   however document [FUJ00231986] appears to be a copy of the April 2011 report

   delivered to Dave King by the PO Account team. On occasion, POL's Head of

   Information Security, Sue Lowther, would also attend the meetings, however she

   would usually meet with the CISO independently.

                                                                                    WI TN06850100




28.I do not recall any specific discussions regarding the Horizon system's integrity

   with POL at the monthly Security meetings.


29. In the Request, the Inquiry asked that I consider [FUJ00225729]. It appears that

   Peter Thompson received an urgent ARQ request from POL on 1 October 2010,

   which originated with Paula Vennells. This was forwarded to me for information,

   and Penny Thomas actioned and responded to the request. I do not recall the

   matters discussed in this email chain, and I had no relationship with either Paula

   Vennells or Helen Rose. I assume communication with Paula Vennells would be

   via the CISO or PO Account Manager, though I do not know what kind of issues

   would be discussed. I do not recall there being a line of communication between

   anyone below the PO Account Manager or CISO level and Paula Vennells.


Audit data from Horizon

30. There was a contractual requirement for Fujitsu to retrieve different types of audit

   data from the Horizon system to support POL, including ARQ data, banking records

   and Help Desk call logs. This was provided through the Litigation Support Service.


31.There were agreed limits on the number of requests and days per requests which

   could be made per annum. POL could request additional data over these

   thresholds and, at that point, a Change Proposal would be raised and costed to

   provide the additional data. The Inquiry has referred me to documents

   [FUJ00229537],         [FUJ00231940],        [FUJ00231939],         [FUJ00231959],

   [FUJ00229495] and [FUJ00156632] which have aided my recollection of the

   process undertaken by the PO Account to provide additional data to POL. In most

   cases, POL would make requests for additional data to Penny Thomas or the

   supporting team (Rajbinder Bains and Andy Dunks), and they would have raised



                                      Page 9 of 18
                                                                                       WI TN06850100
                                                                                     WI TN06850100




   the Change Proposal with me listed as the `owner' as their line manager. I was not

   responsible for the drafting of the Change Proposal or the calculation of the cost of

   additional ARQ data. Penny Thomas would provide costings for the provision of

   additional ARQ data and raise the relevant change paperwork, with the support of

   Change Manager Ken Westfield. Costs would be calculated by reference to an

   agreed spreadsheet of man-days and daily rates, which was held by Ken Westfield.

   I believe that additional costings were always based off of this spreadsheet. Penny

   Thomas would then communicate the rates and additional costings to POL.


32.As mentioned above, my role was focussed on managing the team in terms of

   workload and team welfare. I was not directly involved in the extraction, retrieval

   or provision of ARQ data to POL.


Issues with ARQ data

Duplicate Transactions issue

33.The Inquiry has referred me to documents [FUJ00097033], [FUJ00097035],

   [FUJ00097036],         [FUJ00097042],         [FUJ00097046],        [FUJ00097047],

   [FUJ00097052],         [FUJ00097053],         [FUJ00097054],        [FUJ00097055],

   [FUJ00097056],         [FUJ00097057],         [FUJ00097058],        [FUJ00097059],

   [FUJ00097060],         [FUJ00097062],         [FUJ00121097],        [FUJ00122903],

   [FUJ00122904],         [FUJ00122961],         [FUJ00122958],        [FUJ00154902],

   [FUJ00154905],         [FUJ00154918],         [FUJ00155517],        [FUJ00172046],

   [FUJ00097037],      [FUJ00156217],       [FUJ00225752],       [FUJ00225785]       and

   [FUJ00228770] in relation to an issue identified with audit data. I do not recall this

   event from memory and therefore my recollection has been supported by my

   review of these documents.

34. I recall being made aware of the issue by Penny Thomas but, until reviewing the

   documents referred to me by the Inquiry, I could not recall any details of the issue

   or how it was resolved. From my review of the provided documents, the issue was

   identified in June 2010 whereby duplicate transaction records were being shown

   on the retrieval of records (the "Duplicate Transactions issue"). I would have

   been first notified of the issue on 23 June 2010 when Penny Thomas shared an

   initial report of the     problem with me          via   email ([FUJ00097058] and

   [FUJ00097055]).


35. Penny Thomas appears to have raised the Duplicate Transactions issue with the

   relevant teams within Fujitsu, such as the SSC, for investigation and provided the

   senior management team, including Tom Lillywhite, Peter Thompson, Guy

   Wilkerson and Geoff Butts, with full and regular updates on the matter (this is

   shown in [FUJ00097035], for example). I was not involved in any discussions

   regarding resolution or communication of the issue to POL. Once Penny Thomas

   had notified POL of the Duplicate Transactions issue, she shared notes of a call

   she attended with POL with Tom Lillywhite, Peter Thompson, Graham Welsh and

   me ([FUJ00121097] and [FUJ00154902]).


36.1 was not directly involved in managing the Duplicate Transactions issue, but I

   would have been copied into some emails by Penny Thomas for visibility of what

   she was working on (such as [FUJ00154902] and [FUJ000970331).


37. I can see from the email trail that a software release was issued to fix the Duplicate

   Transactions issue ([FUJ00154918]).


38.I cannot recall any other raised issues which may have impacted the integrity of

Retrieval of Historic ARQ Data / Second Sight

39.In the Request, the Inquiry has referred me to documents [FUJ00225316],

   [FUJ00225329], [FUJ00226141], [FUJ00232061].


40. I have very limited recollection of investigations into historic cases concerning the

   integrity and reliability of Horizon data referenced in the above documents.


41.After consideration of [FUJ00225316], I can recall assisting Pete Newsome with

   raising the Change Proposal. I believe he had received a request from POL to

   retrieve historical Help Desk calls and I helped him to produce the Change

   Proposal with the assistance of Ken Westfield, as per the process described above

   at paragraph 31.


42.I have no further recollection of Fujitsu and/or POL's relationship with Second Sight

   and am only aware of the mention of Second Sight work as it is referred to in

   document [FUJ00225329].


General

43. Unfortunately, I cannot recall anything further on the matters outlined in the

   Request or other matters relevant to the Inquiry's Terms of Reference. There are

   no other matters that I would like to bring to the attention of the Chair of the Inquiry.


Statement of Truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.
