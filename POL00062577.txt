POL00062577

Well that's I mean that's how I first met him was you know
through this business er but I mean I know since then he's
obviously, he stopped doing the er hospitality side and well er I
think he first went in well cos I know he had achistory of it in the
steel business but then he went back into steel after that

business and then er from then on I think he then set up this

GRO

When did he stop doing the hospitality business?

Well phoo er phoo I'd say probably 3 years ago something like
that. I mean don't quote me.

No no.

I mean it could be er I mean I've I'm not very good with er
memory of time but I mean it could be 3 years, it could be 5
years something like that. But itis a few years ago anyway
okay.

But but the the other side of the background has it always been
to do with racing and betting and...

Humh.

Yeah?

Humh.

It's just for the benefit of the tape.

Yes sorry sorry yes yeah yeah.

it's always been that?

Yeah.

And have you had er well you've already said that you've had a
flutter...

Yeah.

..et with him which means betting on the horses.

Yes.

And you essentially earn your money since leaving work with
Lloyds TSB erm as a sort of a commission on iGROI

You. said you get a percentage of it.

¢

JONES:
SINGH:

SINGH:

Yes.

What percentage is that?

Phoo erm 20%.

ls that it? A regular percentage?

Yes.

Okay.

Now with this 20% er and it being regular does that give you a
derived income that you can say well this is about on average
how much I earn a week from that.

It would vary erm...

From what to what?

£200 to £600.

Some weeks it's going to be £200 as your 20% commission and
sometimes it's going fo be £600.

Humh.

Okay, so...

Just depends how successful we are obviously doesn't it yeah.
And and when you talk about that then er what about if the if the
bets are not successful would you still be getting your er...
Well no...

..commission...

Weil no I don't.

It's not then the money that's laid on the horse...

No.

. but the money that's derived from the winnings.

Correct.

Okay. And er er some weeks then if you didn't win anything
between you would you just go home empty handed?

Yes.

It isn't t..

«Yeah.

And how did, oh it's on your mobile yes of course. So we'll
just re-iterate on that then you've gone out on Wednesday and
you've come back on Friday.
Yes.

Erm you've driven 2 people, Mri

Yes.

You've been given 550 euros for petrol. You spent you saya
180 you think on petrol and parking.

You have a balance of a 100 euros in your briefcase...

Yeah.

..which was in the car this morning...

Yes.

..which you were going to give back to M!

With a note of my personal expenditure and everything so he
could reconcile out exactly how the 550 euros had been spent.
Well why why didn't you keep the 100 euro?

Cos I got no need for em.

see.

I mean I mean it wasn't like I'm giving you 550 euros, it was like
here's 550 euros for your expenditure and whatever and just give
me a note of what you spent, what...

It's just that I'm beginning to have problems understanding things
with you because obviously you must have had a fairly
responsible job.

Yes.

Which we haven't quite got into the depths of that yet.

No no.

POL00062577
POL00062577

JONES: And by what you explained to Mr Singh a little bit earlier you're
off ont
Yes.

Erm so you know you've not been working for some time.

Yes.

Fair enough and your salary happens to be in payment in
November, you said was 1500 net.

Yes.

Right okay. Erm I'm just trying to work out how you...

1 go from a responsible job like that to just driving around.

Well you're working on a potential of 20% commission if you win.
Yes.

On horses er but as you said again to Mr Singh if you won
nothing and he'd just let you go out empty handed.

Yes.

JONES: And there you are going off on a what is a fairly lengthy trip I
mean...

Yeah.

.in Paris in Lille driving around...

Humh yes.

. for nothing. Alright the the somebody put you up in a hotel but
you've literally done nothing out of the 2 of you really.

Erm no but I mean you know there's an enjoyment factor there
erj GRO} ad a couple of bets while we were away which I didn’t
know about, vast amounts, probably around about £50 or
something from what we bet on while we were away and that
was about it.
JONES: Yeah. Soi mean so did you ever make anything at all while you

were out there?

What from...

Let's talk about these couple of bets then.

Yeah.

Just for sake of argument.
_-Yeah._...

iS

So what did you have on it, how much did you bet then?
Phoo...

Yes how much did you bet then while you were away?

Erm on the Wednesday I think the bets were about a £1,000
possibly.

Yeah.

And then on the Thursday and Friday erm!

yi had...
Sorry can I if we just go on did you bet a £1,000? Is that you?

Erm I put the bet on but that was {GRO} betting.

Right, that's what I'm trying to get to the bottom of.

Yes sorry.

{s that your money bets?

No I put I've put the bet on.

Right.

But Paul give me the money.

But not with your money.

Erm well it is ostensibly with my money because like it comes out
of my Coral account. I have a Coral deposit account, yeah?
Now...

Alright mate we're going to have to go into that in a minute then.
Yeah okay.

So...

But the sense of what happens is I

ill say well I want to

have a bet on this horse and I'll put the bet on out of my money
and then er every now and again erm I'll give {ll reconcile what
he's bet, what he's had returns in or whatever and say this is
{GRO Bnd he will then pay me back in

cash to cover his betting.
So you've got a Coral account?

how much you owe me {

Yes.
Whose name's that in?
Mine.

interview. doo

Right. And how much has that got in it?

Today?

Well yeah alright then today.

Erm about just short of £900 I think.

£900. How much did it have in it last Tuesday?

Oh right erm how much did it have in it last Tuesday I would
think er £2000 possibly.

Right, and where does that £2000 come from?

Er I paid well that £2000 would have been er cash that Mr

ad given me fo cover what he had already owed

me.

So the 2000 in fact is cash fro
this is where...

Yeah.

Yeah, this is

_.l'm losing it with you you see.
Yeah.
Did you say my money and his money? Erm it seems to me it's

c -3 money that we're actually talking about which
you may well go and place for him erm on an account using your
name.

I mean...

But I get I get, please just hear me out...

Yeah sure.

I just get the impression that's what's happening in fact is he's
giving you the money for you to go and place the bets, is that
right?

Well essentially but what actually happens is my account with my
money on when we when he used me to place a bet it will start
off as my account with my money on right, okay?

Well yeah yeah go on,

POL00062577

POL00062577

17

Yeah right so erm I place the bets for him out of my money erm
when he loses he obviously because I've paid for it he obviously
owes me money yes?

Fair enough.

Right, so he would then give me money to cover what he owes

me which I then use to put back into my Coral account to cover
the money he's already lent off me. Do you understand that?
SINGH: It gets a bit tricky though doesn’t it? Bear in mind that you say
that you're on 20% commission when it wins. Now if he’s, it gets
so tricky if he’s asked you to go and put a bet on and it loses but
it's been out of your money in the first place.
Yes.
Do you get what I mean? How do you balance ***
Well if you've got me briefcase...
Yeah.
you know if you have a look in there there's a sheet for every
day for alf the bets that he does.
Right.
Okay so you can see what he's been betting.
Right. .
And what he's returned and then what you know what proportion
of that you know.
When did you start this Corals account?
Phoo erm 4 months ago something like that.
Four months ago.

Yeah.
It should take us back. to,Sept
{ I thinie it would be about...

August?
..erm I phoo erm I would think yeah it would be about September
I would think between September...
September 2002.
Yeah.

POL00062577

No.

How did you start this account?

You just phone up.

Yes.

Then you say you want to open an account.

Do you have to give them any money?

Erm well no originally right okay erm originally I opened it up
sorry...

JONES: pecececters

r ..oh yeah okay, erm opened it up erm and it's erm a debit card

betting account. So basically what happens is you put a bet on,
they take the money out of your bank account and they return
any money fo your bank account. Erm now in December when

iGRO} i mean I¢ SRO; thas always put, phoned me up to put bets on

it for a long time okay, it's not just something that's happened in
December, he's been doing it for you know last 12 months
probably. Erm now in December because he was like starting to
use me a lot more as his like personal bookmaker you can call
me really yeah erm I then changed the account from Coral to er
like a debit account where they take money out, put it back in on
the bank account to a deposit account where by I put money on
deposit with them so there's funds there available for whenever I
or whenever! GRO wanted to have a bet.
Right so how much did you put in then?
How much did I put.
Well following the last little bit that you said, you said that you put
you deposited some money in so that your funds there.
Phoo.
In fact what I'm trying to what I'm getting at the bottom of
Brendan is how much money you've actually put into this.
Through my Coral account?
No just how much money you've actually put into its into this this
betting this side of the work if you like.

Well have you put any money into it?

I will have...

Yourself.

..I will have put money.

Yeah well how much?

Have I actually deposited humh weil I well I don't suppose i
probably haven't because when I transferred it over when I
transferred it from a debit account to a deposit account I won
about a £1,000's on that day right and because I didn't want it
going back to the bank account because then it's out of my it's
out of my system for 2 days if you know what I mean cos they
pay it back like today, it do get back to my other bank account for
Wednesday so effectively there's money there which I can't use
so I said can you just hold it open, they said yeah we can
transfer you onto a deposit account whereby you can add money
onto your account or draw money off the account if there's any
there whenever you want but essentially funds will always stay
on that account.

Is it like the equivalent of having erm a facility at a normal bank
whereby you know like an overdraft facility.

Yeah but you're not allowed to overdraw the account.

Right.

Erm but it's just like er you know I just phone them up and say
3.30 at Lingfield can you put me £50's each way on such and
such horse and they say fine, comes out my balance, if the horse
wins or whatever there's a return on it it then goes back onto my
balance.

So so far you've you've said then that a thousand that you think
was one of the day that you converted from your debit card to a
debit account, is that right?

Yeah I think so yeah.

Anything besides that?

what it means by money laundering?

Weill I think I do.

Erm it's basically I think it's money er derived from er a criminal
activity er which I think do they normally like sell it off at a
discounted rate to somebody else to dispose off, I don't know. I
mean that would be my general understanding of it.

That's your general understanding of it.

Yeah well I think yeah. ' don't think I'm a million miles away
there.

Huhumh. And presumably do you appreciate that it's a criminal
offence?

i do yes.

beside a silver BMW in Fort Duniop car park.

ind his wife down to their daughters near

1 think converted into Stirling.

there?

collects euro.. he buys euros at the Post Office in Rugeley and

then takes them to a Travel Agents to sell them at a, he can, he
says he can make a turn on the rate between what he buys at
and what he sells at.

Se what what er apportionment of his time, you say since
December 2002 when you met, is that when you actually met

or have you known 7”

I for a few years I don't know, it might be 4 or it
might be 7 but you know it's a few years anyway.

And under what circumstances did you first meet him?

Erm I first met him when he came to er Lloyds TSB to open a
business account.

And are was the business account that he came fo open up er
one for himself or for a company?

Erm it was for himself I think I think he was yeah he was just a
sole trader at the time.

Just as
Yeah.
And did you do the paperwork for the opening of that company?
Yeah.

You did. And can you tell me the nature of what the business

was about?

At that time er he was dealing in er corporate hospitality.

Corporate hospitality?

Yeah.

Okay, can you just explain a little bit more about that for me?

All what he would do is er for arguments sake I mean I think he
GRO land he'd

used to have erm a lease of a box at _ GRO
arrange for you know clients to like go there for an afternoons
racing you know, he'd lay on the food and the drinks and things
like that, and anything else that anybody wanted you know a

corporate event organising er he would do.

And since you've known er Mri has he always had

this erm sort of er interest or business interest that relates to to

POL00062577

Weil that's { mean that's how I first met him was you know

through this business er but I mean I know since then he's
obviously, he stopped doing the er hospitality side and well er I
think he first went in well cos I know he had a history of it in the
steel business but then he went back into steel after that
business and then er from then on I think he then set up this

When did he stop doing the hospitality business?

Weil phoo er phoo i'd say probably 3 years ago something like

that. I mean don't quote me.
JONES: No no.
GRO 1 I mean it could be er I mean I've I'm not very good with er

memory of time but I mean it could be 3 years, it could be 5
years something like that. But itis a few years ago anyway
okay.

SINGH: But but the the other side of the background has it always been

to do with racing and betting and...

Humh.

Yeah?

Humh.

It's just for the benefit of the tape.

Yes sorry sorry yes yeah yeah.

{t's always been that?

Yeah.

And have you had er well you've already said that you've had a

flutter...

Yeah.

..et with him which means betting on the horses.
Yes.

And you essentially earn your money since leaving work with
Lioyds TSB erm as a sort of a commission on

‘Perviaw.dor
POL00062577

Yes.

What percentage is that?

Phoo erm 20%.

Is that it? A regular percentage?

Yes.

Okay.

Now with this 20% er and it being regular does that give you a
derived income that you can say well this is about on average
how much I earn a week from that.

It would vary erm...

From what to what?

£200 to £600.

Some weeks it's going to be £200 as your 20% commission and
sometimes it's going to be £600.

Humh.

Okay, so...

Just depends how successful we are obviously doesn't it yeah.
And and when you talk about that then er what about if the if the
bets are not successful would you still be getting your er...
Well no...

commission...

Well no I don't.

Yeah.

which was in the car this morning...

Yes.

..which you were going to give back to Mr {

With a note of my personal expenditure and everything so he
could reconcile out exactly how the 550 euros had been spent.
Weil why why didn't you keep the 100 euro?

Cos I got no need for em.

i see.

i mean I mean it wasn't like I'm giving you 550 euros, it was like
here's 550 euros for your expenditure and whatever and just give
me a note of what you spent, what...

And by what you explained to Mr Singh a little bit earlier you're
off on stress.

Yes.

Emm so you know you've not been working for some time.

Yes.

Fair enough and your salary happens to be in payment in
November, you said was iGROI et.

Yes.

Right okay. Erm I'm just trying to work out how you...

I go from a responsible job like that to just driving around.

Well you're working on a potential of 20% commission if you win.
Yes.

On horses er but as you said again to Mr Singh if you won
nothing and he'd just let you go out empty handed.

Yes.

And there you are going off on a what is a fairly lengthy trip I
mean...

Yeah.

.in Paris in Lille driving around...

Hurmh yes.

.for nothing. Alright the the somebody put you up in a hotel but
you've literally done nothing out of the 2 of you really.

Erm no but I mean you know there's an enjoyment factor there
em iGROhad a couple of bets while we were away which I didn't
know about, vast amounts, probably around about £50 or
something from what we bet on while we were away and that
was about it.

Yeah. So I mean so did you ever make anything at all while you
were out there?

What from...

Let's talk about these couple of bets then.

Yeah.

Just for sake of argument.

Yeah...

POL00062577
POL00062577

So what did you have on it, how much did you bet then?
Phoo...

Yes how much did you bet then while you were away?

Erm on the Wednesday I think the bets were about a £1,000
possibly.

Yeah.

And then on the Thursday and Friday erm [GRO had...

Sorry can I if we just go on did you bet a £1,000? Is that you?
Erm I put the bet on but that was {ero} betting.

Right, that's what I'm trying to get fo the bottom of.

Yes sorry.

is that your money bets?

No I put I've put the bet on.

Right.

But Paul give me the money.

But not with your money.

Erm well it is ostensibly with my money because like it comes out
of my Coral account. I have a Coral deposit account, yeah?
Now...

Alright mate we're going to have to go into that in a minute then.
Yeah okay.

So...

But the sense of what happens i:

will say well I want to

have a bet on this horse and I'll put the bet on out of my money
and then er every now and again erm I'll give I'll reconcile what
he's bet, what he's had returns in or whatever and say this is

how much you owe m:

ind he will then pay me back in
cash to cover his betting.

So you've got a Coral account?

Yes.

Whose name's that in?

Yeah.

Right. And how much has that got in it?

Today?

Well yeah alright then today.

Erm about just short of £900 I think.

£900. How much did it have in it last Tuesday?

Oh right erm how much did it have in it last Tuesday I would
think er £2000 possibly.

Right, and where does that £2000 come from?

Er I paid well that £2000 would have been er cash that Mr

i; ad given me to cover what he had already owed

me.

So the 2000 in fact is cash from
this is where...

Yeah.

..’m losing it with you you see.
Yeah.

Did you say my money and his money? Erm it seems to me it's

Yeah, this is

money that we're actually talking about which
you may well go and place for him erm on an account using your
name.

I mean...

But I get I get, please just hear me out...

Yeah sure.

I just get the impression that's what's happening in fact is he's
giving you the money for you to go and place the bets, is that
right?

Well essentially but what actually happens is my account with my
money on when we when he used me to place a bet it will start
off as my account with my rnoney on right, okay?

Well yeah yeah go on.

POL00062577
POL00062577

17

Yeah right so erm I place the bets for him out of my money erm
when he loses he obviously because I've paid for it he obviously
owes me money yes?

Fair enough.

Right, so he would then give me money to cover what he owes

me which I then use to put back into my Coral account to cover
the money he's already lent off me. Do you understand that?
SINGH: it gets a bit tricky though doesn't it? Bear in mind that you say
that you're on 20% commission when it wins. Now if he's, it gets
so tricky if he's asked you to go and put a bet on and it loses but
it's been out of your money in the first place.
Yes.
Do you get what I mean? How do you balance ***
Weil if you've got me briefcase...
Yeah.
you know if you have a look in there there’s a sheet for every
day for all the bets that he does.
Right.
Okay so you can see what he's been betting.
Right.
And what he's returned and then what you know what proportion
of that you know.
When did you start this Corals account?
Phoo erm 4 months ago something like that.
Four months ago.
Yeah.
It should take us back to September.
I think it would be about...
August?

..erm I phoo erm I would think yeah it would be about September

I would think between September...

No.

How did you start this account?

You just phone up.

Yes.

Then you say you want to open an account.

Do you have to give them any money?

Erm well no originally right okay erm originally { opened it up
sorry...

,.oh yeah okay, erm opened it up erm and it's erm a debit card
betting account. So basically what happens is you put a bet on,
they take the money out of your bank account and they return
any money to your bank account. Erm now in December when
has always put, phoned me up to put bets on
it for a long time okay, it's not just something that's happened in
December, he's been doing it for you know last 12 months
probably. Erm now in December because he was like starting to
use me a lot more as his like personal bookmaker you can call
me really yeah erm I then changed the account frorn Coral to er
like a debit account where they take money out, put it back in on
the bank account to a deposit account where by I put money on
deposit with them so there's funds there available for whenever I
wanted to have a bet.

or whenevel.
Right so how much did you put in then?

How much did I put.

Well following the last little bit that you said, you said that you put
you deposited some money in so that your funds there.

Phoo.

In fact what I'm trying to what I'm getting at the bottom of
Brendan is how much money you've actually put into this.
Through my Coral account?

No just how much money you've actually put into its into this this
betting this side of the work if you like.

Erm I don't think it's quite as clear cut as that really because

POL00062577

Well have you put any money into it?

I will have...

Yourself.

.. will have put money.

Yeah well how much?

Have I actually deposited humh well I well I don't suppose I
probably haven't because when I transferred it over when I
transferred it from a debit account to a deposit account I won
about a £1,000's on that day right and because I didn't want it
going back to the bank account because then it's out of my it's
out of my system for 2 days if you know what I mean cos they
pay it back like today, it do get back to my other bank account for
Wednesday so effectively there's money there which I can't use
so I said can you just hold it open, they said yeah we can
transfer you onto a deposit account whereby you can add money
onto your account or draw money off the account if there's any
there whenever you want but essentially funds will always stay
on that account.

Is it like the equivalent of having erm a facility at a normal bank
whereby you know like an overdraft facility.

Yeah but you're not allowed to overdraw the account.

Right.

Erm but it's just like er you know I just phone them up and say
3.30 at Lingfield can you put me £50's each way on such and
such horse and they say fine, comes out my balance, if the horse
wins or whatever there's a return on it it then goes back onto my
balance.

So so far you've you've said then that a thousand that you think
was one of the day that you converted from your debit card to a
debit account, is that right?

Yeah I think so yeah.

Anything besides that?

POL00062577

20

Well I mean since then erm I have been using erm when I put

covering betting.
JONES: Huhumh.

I would then you know he would give me money and I would

then keeping topping my current account up.
JONES: So it's eris
No cos that's money he owes me. That's money he's owed me

's money?

because I put the bets on for him, the horse has lost so then he
has to pay me, yeah?

Would you say would you consider yourself, would it be fair to
say that you're an amateur sort of a...

Gambler.

gambler?

Yeah,

Punter?

Yeah.

Racehorse and punter.

Yes.

Do the dogs as well?

Er 1 might have one bet on a dog per year.

SINGH: Have you been doing it for a long time?
' GRO: Gambling?
Yeah.

Erm yeah I put { mean it's always been an interest of mine,

betting or whatever erm and cert.. over the last year because
I've been working and I've had more time to study form and such
like and joined of er racing tips to organisations er I've been
doing it you know on a lot you know bigger scale.

arrested on suspicion of money laundering.

Yes.

I better ask you first, do you understand what you mean by that
what it means by money laundering?

Well I think I do.

Right could you tell me what you think it is?

Erm it's basically I think it's money er derived from er a criminal

activity er which I think do they normally like sell it off ata
discounted rate to somebody else to dispose off, I don't know. I
mean that would be my general understanding of it.

JONES: That's your general understanding of it.

Yeah well I think yeah. I don't think I'm a million miles away

there.
JONES: Huhumh. And presumably do you appreciate that it's a criminal
oc oennenninnnn offence?

ind his wife down to their daughters near

Weill presumably he was going to take some euros in there which
I think converted into Stirling.

JONES: Right, how do you know he was going to take some euros in
there?

Erm because I know that or from what he has told me that he

collects euro.. he buys euros at the Post Office in Rugeley and
then takes them to a Travel Agents to sell them at a, he can, he
says he can make a turn on the rate between what he buys at
and what he sells at.

JONES: Huhumh. So in in the event of this morning then what did you or

what did you think was gonna happen? I mean I'm just trying fo

take it down into very very simple...

Yeah yeah okay.

So you're there, you're in the car park...

Alli dois L...

Yes.

And in respect of today had he mentioned anything to you today
about what the business was for today?

to the holiday hypermarket first and then we would then be
driving down to Oxford to take erm his wife down to his
daughters. From there I think erm he hadn't got the rest of the
