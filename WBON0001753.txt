Rob (Clerk at OEC) has asked if Stephanie can assist Lord Grabiner and Gideon. As a junior Junior she is much

cheaper, so as a structure it makes sense — but is that OK by POL ?

Thanks

All

I have spoken to clerks at OEC.

Lord Grabiner is reading in. Rob had already given him the electronic bundle. He was interested in it all anyway !!! A

good thing.

DCQC and Lord Grabiner (plus Gideon) are to meet today for a full download session.

Rob will revert to me if Stephanie is needed too.

I have made it clear this is "warm up" work, no decisions have yet been made.

Thanks for VM. Understood.

We will now:

1) Call OEC clerks re Lord Grabiner QC and recusal and instruct the start of the "warm up work" today for
recusal application (if one is actually to proceed — POL to decide on that issue over time).

2) Get both electronic bundle and paper bundle (already done in readiness) to Lord Grabiner QC now.

3) Instruct Gideon as Junior. Note Gideon's comment re Stephanie. I'll be guided by LGQC needs & desires,
subject to POL instructions.

4) WBD & POL will later speak about CIT appeal QC identity and noted on DCQC comment - yes it could
well be him supported by Lord Neuberger advice (when received in April); and

5) We will later take decisions on Lord Neuberger CIT appeal advice, but currently that feels like a "yes" to
me — but we can come back to that.
