Dear Mr Railton
Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry — Your letter dated 9 October 2025

Thank you very much for your letter of 9 October 2025 together with the responses of Post Office Limited to the
recommendations set out in Vol 1 of my report. I am very pleased that the Post Office was able to respond to
my recommendations within the time frame set out in recommendation 1 and I am equally pleased that the Post
Office intends to publish proposals in relation to restorative justice by 31 October 2025.

As I know you will appreciate, I will be reflecting upon all the responses received from the Department and the
Post Office over the coming weeks. I also intend to continue to monitor the operation of the redress schemes,
and I will also monitor the scheme or schemes which will shortly emerge for restorative justice. In these
circumstances, I have decided that any further observations and/or supplementary recommendations which I
consider appropriate to make on the topics of redress schemes and restorative justice should await the
remaining Volume of my report.

Yours sincerely

Sir Wyn Williams
Chair
