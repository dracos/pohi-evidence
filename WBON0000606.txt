Mandy

Thanks for this. A few small comments and changes attached. However, I don't think this addresses the big
questions on Bates' case.

The key question for me though is whether POL sent out the full contract terms with the Transfer Pack or
not. If not, how did Bates get a copy of the full contract?

I think (and this might be a guess) that the process might have been as follows:

e¢ Aconditions of appointment document was sent out before the branch transferred.

e The branch transferred and on the same day the SPMR signs his acknowledge of appointment (in the
Transfer Pack).

The full contract was left in the branch by the old SPMR. This was ok though because it was in the

branch when they signed the contract.

e However, what happened for new branches where there was no existing branch?

Also can you look at para 18 again and also re-read the first 36 paras of the Bates Defence. Can Paul say
that the Two Page Document was a mistake.

Lets discuss.

Could you send the latest word version of this to Andy please? Andy, Paul actually signed it as he was going
to be away and we hadn’t yet applied for an extension, but he is back before the 24th so we intend to change
as needed.

Thanks
