Virginia

You may see or hear some coverage this evening/tomorrow am on the external review we have agreed to commission
into the very few cases where Subpostmasters have claimed the Horizon system caused errors, resulting in them being
falsely accused and/or convicted of fraud.

This is a deliberate decision by us to be utterly transparent and hooefully to close down what has become a bandwagon
based on no fact.

Whatever the review finds, good or bad, we will respond to it.

I shall send you a copy of our statement. James Arbutnot issued a statement (jointly agreed) to the Times who had been
in touch. We are not defensive; we do want to keep it in perspective (not quite what all the media want of course!).
