Messages returned by the filtering process are for one day less than the date range specified i.e. messages
are not returned for the last day of the specified range. The Prosecution Support Service have stopped
processing ARQs until this is resolved as the date range displayed in the final spreadsheet does not match
the date range of the messages actually returned.

This error was introduced at 3.13, deployed on 28 November.

Messages returned by the filtering process are for one day less than the date range specified i.e. messages
are not returned for the last day of the specified range.

These records are incorrect in that the transaction data provided does not reflect the time period specified
and the audit trail is incorrect.

If these reports were returned and presented at Court the discrepancy would be obvious and the integrity of
the returns could be in question.

As a result of the above we have stopped processing ARQs until this issue is resolved.

li,

Received request from POL for ARQ retrieval for 18.5.10 - upon running a Slow and Fast ARQ have been unable to retrieve files for
this date, however upon extending back end date by 15 days data has been retrieved.

bpon further investigation with Andy and Gerald have found that in order to retrieve data for 18.5 search criteria will need to
be 18.5 to 19.5 which then brings back data for 18/5.

[this was not the case before R3.13, before we were able do a search on 1 particular day and the necessary data would be
retrieved.

if data is provided to POL spreadsheet will show data for 18.5 6 19.5 when infact it is just for the 18.5.

Fixed by a new version of AEClient.exe. Records are now returned for the date specified as the filter end date.

6:39 UseriAndrew Mansfield

[the fix can be tested by performing an ARQ and specifying the same date as the filter start and end dates (picking a date for
shich records matching the filter criteria are known to exist in the retrieved files). The expected records should be found by
the filtering process. (Previously no records would be returned when the start and end dates are the same. More generally, no
records would be returned for the specified end date.)

fhe test needs to be performed for both slow and fast ARQs.
