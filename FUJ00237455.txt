Hello

We have received further information from the programme about the allegations they intend to include and
contributors.

We are well aware of it all — there is nothing ‘new’ to us at all, although some (selective use of extracts from
privileged legal documents concerning prosecutions) have not previously been in public domain.

They included the para below which you need to be aware of. You have kindly already previously me with info re
“third tier/ line” support. I’m a bit perplexed by what they say this person is saying and assume it is, as usual, a
misunderstanding of the ‘remote access’ subject. I’d be grateful for your urgent opinion.

Thanks

Mel
