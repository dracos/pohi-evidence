Hi Helen

Spoke with PSNI IO, Det Constable Mandy Campbell, and she has recommended prosecution
with file going to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS). The PPS has been made aware of the
Horizon integrity issues and that the PO assistant under investigation has introduced Horizon as
a possible defence.

Knowing the PPS, they will not pursue prosecution.

Regards

Simon
