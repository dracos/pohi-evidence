Attachment: BRIEFING NOTE - WENDY BUFFREY.doc

Dear All

Please find attached briefing note by Harry Bowyer senior Counsel of Cartwright King. As you will appreciate
Cartwright King involvement goes beyond looking at POLS proposed investigation report (POIR),but also necessitates
the related paper work and where appropriate the entirety of the prosecution file. This is one such case which has
required Cartwright King to consider the prosecution file in order to properly protect POL.

As you will see Cartwright King cannot properly deal with the draft POIR until certain matters have been dealt with,
these have been set out in paragraph 23.

This mediation has the potential to cause serious risk to POL from a criminal perspective and therefore require urgent
and detail attention and as suggested it would be helpful if an experience investigation officer is appointed to look at
the material in the case. Once that has been done, it may be appropriate to have a conference call.

Rob — have you got any body in mind who can be appointed without any delay.

This case clearly has a red alarm bells attached to it and POL cannot afford to get it wrong.

Regards

Jarnail
