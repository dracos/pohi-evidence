Hi Kevin, Angela

The submission for the Transformation Committee from the Programmes are due to be with the Strategy Team by
lunchtime on Thursday 28" August. I had the monthly meeting with Michael Brown yesterday and agreed that as there
was not the usual Transformation Committee in August, the Period end isn’t until the 31°* August and the slide was
discussed as part of our Steering Group on the 8" August that it was appropriate to submit the slide we did for August.
I've reviewed the content and up-dated the information with the data or up-dates we’ve received since the 8 August
but the majority of content is the same. I’ve attached the slide and a supporting word document explaining the key
points. You don’t need to look at the excel document unless there is something we need to change on the slide.

l’'ve said to Michael that there are no new risks that need to be raised.

If you could review that would be great.

Angela,

I'm obviously on leave next week so if you could submit the slide to Michael once you are both happy with it, that would
be great.

As always, if there are any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask.
Thanks

Gayle
