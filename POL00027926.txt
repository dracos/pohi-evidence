SCHEDULE A3
CHANGE CONTROL
INTRODUCTION
Amendments and changes to:

1.1.1. the Clauses, Schedules and Annexes to this Agreement and to the Contract
Controlled Documents and Contract Referenced Documents listed in its
Schedules shall only be made; and

1.1.2 documents forming part of or related to Work Orders, where the amendment or
change satisfies the criteria specified in paragraph 5.3 of Schedule A2, may be
made,

in accordance with the Change Control Procedure.

Within the context of the following sections of this Schedule the term "change" includes
both amendments and changes.

Notwithstanding the above, the parties agree that certain changes that relate to the KS
cloud platform will only need to follow the Change Control Procedure where the
circumstances set out within paragraph 2.3 of Schedule I4 are met.

PRINCIPLES

Where Post Office or Fujitsu Services identifies the need for a change, then Post Office
may at any time request a change or Fujitsu Services may at any time recommend a
change. Such a request or recommendation shall only be made and shall only be valid if
authorised (in each case) in accordance with the procedures set out in paragraph 3 of
this Schedule.

Neither Post Office nor Fujitsu Services shall unreasonably withhold or delay their
agreement to any change or proposal in relation thereto.

Until such time as a change has been fully authorised in accordance with the procedures
set out in paragraph 3 of this Schedule, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall continue
as if the change had not been made.

Any discussions which may take place between Post Office and Fujitsu Services on a
change before its authorisation shall be without prejudice to the rights of either Party.

Any purported change provided by Fujitsu Services that has not been otherwise agreed
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.1 above shall be undertaken entirely at
the expense and liability of Fujitsu Services. If so required by Post Office, Fujitsu Services
shall at its own expense promptly take all steps necessary to reverse and remove the
effects of such purported change.

3. CHANGE CONTROL PROCEDURE

3.1 Standard Change Procedures

3.1.1

Discussions between Post Office and Fujitsu Services in relation to a change to
be effected through the Change Control Procedure shall result in any one of the
following:

3.1.1.1 no further action;

3.1.1.2 a request to make a change by Post Office's authorised representative (a
“Change Request" or “CR”);

3.1.1.3 a recommendation to make a change by Fujitsu Services;

3.1.1.4 the use of a Commercial Terms (“CT”) form to enact a Work Order the
contents of which are as detailed in Schedule D2, paragraph 4.2.

Post Office shall send Change Requests to Fujitsu Services Commercial Change
Manager and Fujitsu Services shall respond to such Change Request by
submitting a Commercial Terms (“CT”) and/or Change Control Note (“CCN”) to
the Post Office Change Control Manager.

If Fujitsu Services considers that the preparation of a CT and/or CCN, requested
by Post Office, would necessitate allocation of resources in excess of five man-
days, Fujitsu Services shall notify Post Office accordingly and, on agreement by
Post Office, Fujitsu Services will make a proposal for a paid study of the cost and
implications of producing the required CT and/or CCN. Pending Post Office's
acceptance of that proposal or in the event that Post Office does not agree that
such proposal should be submitted, Fujitsu Services will be relieved of its
obligations to produce such CT and/or CCN.

A recommendation to make a change by Fujitsu Services shall be submitted to
the Post Office Change Control Manager in the form of a CT and/or CCN

For each CT and/or CCN submitted, Post Office shall evaluate the CT and/or
CCN and, as appropriate, during the period of validity:

3.1.5.1 request further information;

3.1.5.2 authorise the change set out in the CT and /or CCN in accordance with
paragraph 3.1.8 below;

3.1.5.3 suggest modifications to the CT and/or CCN (including, without limitation,
corrections of minor errors to avoid unnecessary rejection); or

advance), on behalf of Post Office.
