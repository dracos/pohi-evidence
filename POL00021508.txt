new model branches were now live and the business was seeing a good
response to the model from the market and from the Post Office's multiple
partners. He was confident that the target of 1,200 branch conversions
would be achieved this year but there was an ongoing risk if the
programme fost stakeholder support from the NFSP or Consumer Focus,

programme were now working with the business as advocates, presenting
at road shows and offering one to one visits with prospective branches.

(b) The Board asked at what point the business would be confident about
hitting the 3 year target. Kevin Gilliland explained this would probably be
in 2013/14 (after the next funding discussions); however, the results for
this year should give some confidence.

(c) The Board requested a quarterly report to understand the transformation
pipeline, showing the number of Postmasters interviewed; number
accepted; number in progress and the number completed against quarterly

targets,

Paula Vennells assured the Board that the Executive Team already
ACTION: monitored the programme at this level and would provide this information
