Thanks Andy

Susan, Rod
Alan has asked me when he will get the updated pack. Can we set a time today, say 10.30 for final comments?

Subject: Mediation Pack v2

All
Please find attached the updated version of the mediation pack (plus a comparison to the last version).
Key amendments:

e Incorporated all the amendments from the Working Group meeting.

« Incorporated the extra comments from the CK call today.

e Updated the letters to the SPMRs to fit with the new Scheme structure.

e Drafted new funding agreements, which are now separate from the mediation agreement.

I've left blank the cash figures for the mediation financial support. Based on Kay's legal aid rate of £125ph, my
suggestions are:

« £750 for a half day mediation (2 hrs prep + 4 hrs mediation)
* £1250 for full day mediation (2 hrs prep + 8 hrs mediation)

Happy to discuss.

Kind regards
Andy
