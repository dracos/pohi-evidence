Jane
A further update on the actions below:

e Please find attached an updated appeal table, now with initial input from DCQC (but not yet a full review). LGQC
and LNQC are of the view that Post Office should only be making very limited concessions. This is because they
fear that making concessions is a slippery slope, and even making a few concessions indicates to the Court of
Appeal that the SPM contracts are incomplete and open to further implied terms. They therefore advise that the
implied terms that DCQC suggested be conceded, should only be offered to the Court as incidents of the
“necessary cooperation" term rather than freestanding implied terms in their own right. This is still a concession,
but delivered in a way that runs less risk of undermining our wider legal arguments on when terms should and
should not be implied.

I'll now give some thought as to how we can distil this into a more digestible paper for the board subcommittee.
e Please find attached an up to date litigation timetable.

The Counsel team (Grabiner, Neuberger and Cavender) and I are looking to meet / have a conference call on Tuesday to
prepare for the board sub-committee meeting the following day. This is mainly to make sure that we have a unified set of
messages to deliver. If I can find a convenient time for them all, I'll forward this to you and you and / or Ben are welcome
to join us.

Kind regards

Subject: Catch up

Hi Andy

Could we have a quick chat sometime this morning to see where we are up to? In particular:

Where did you get to on the letter to the CofA?
Common Issues appeal documentation — where are we up to?

Timetable — a while ago I think you agreed to prepare an update timetable of all the various hearings/CMCs

etc indicating which ones were stayed?
Board briefing for next week — we need to coordinate work!

Many thanks,

Jane
