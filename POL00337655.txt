() The POL Release Management Process will be invoked for all Releases that impact or
present a risk to the controlled environments and services.

O) ARelease is defined as a bundle of maintenance, enhancements, fixes to the service, or
could be an initial deployment of the service.

() POL Release assurance ensures that Releases are managed and delivered in a consistent,
predictable and cost-effective manner.

Release Management vs Service Design & Transition Management ©

Releases will be generated from either Release Management or Transition
Management - the difference is the level of governance and assurance.

QO) Anew or changed service will require Service Design and Transition to ensure that the activities
are fully managed:

Q_ Releases follow POL SD&T policy, including artefacts such as

Q Service Readiness Reviews, Boards & Checkpoints will be used

QA Service Acceptance Board will be convened for approval of the Service changes prior to go live

Q A software change with minimal or no change to IT Service management processed will require
POL Release Management:

Q_ Releases will follow POL Release management strategy including artefacts such as
Q Release records, scheduling detail, Release Notes and Test plans/results etc

Q_ To be approved by POL Release Manager & Board
