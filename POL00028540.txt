Dear Tony,

Roll-Out Review

Tam writing to confirm the position reached after the recent discussions
between Post Office Counters Limited and ICL Pathway about the Criteria
which were due to be met by 24 November 1999, in relation to Clause 6.1.1 of
the Second Supplementary Agreement (CCN 560 to the Codified Agreement).

Some of the criteria due to be met by 24 November were not, in fact, met. Asa
result of this, Post Office Counters Limited would be entitled to issue a notice
to ICL Pathway, suspending the roll-out. At ICL Pathway’s request, and
following our discussions, we have decided not to issue such a notice at
present, in the hope that the work programme due to conclude by 3
December 1999, as discussed at our meeting on 24 November, and refined in
subsequent discussions betwéen John Dicks and Min Burdett., will provide .
sufficient assurance that the issues highlighted by the failure of certain of the
criteria are capable of resolution before the roll-out is due to resume on 24
January 2000.

Post Office Counters Limited reserves its right to issue a notice under clause
6.1.1 of the Second Supplementary Agreement if sufficient assurance is not

provided by 3 December. Any decision which we may take on or after

3 December in relation to the clause 6.1.1 provisions will not affect Post Office
Counters Limited’s subsequent rights to suspend roll-out under clauses 6.1.2
and 6.1.3 of the Second Supplementary Agreement.

Yours sincerely,

KEITH BAINES
Head of Horizon Commercial
