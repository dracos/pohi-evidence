Colin, please find attached the problem report for the incident in question. As you can see from the report there were
some issues in the time it took for PO to carry out approriate agreed actions such as updating the IVR and then the
issues around the suitability of the IVR

we obviously need to understand from keith the origin of the additional costs.
