Merthyr Dyfan is a police prosecution, i.e. it is not a case that we brought.

Because it’s not our case, we don’t have much information on it, but have been reaching out for the
details.

We should know more tomorrow.

Thanks Rodric and sorry about the Broadband!

The Merthyr Dyfan case - is this a case which are taking through the courts or a Costcutter related case?
What are the details? Is there a Horizon element? I think this is the first I have see f this one, but
apologies if it is covered elsewhere.
