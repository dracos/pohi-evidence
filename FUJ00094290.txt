0217 Post Office HNG-X Counter Review v2 0 24 2 10.doc

Jean-Philippe,

You may be aware that an incident was raised during the HNGX pilot that there have been two instances where a single transaction
was recorded twice on the system. As you can appreciate from your work around PCI Compliance, the integrity of the system is
critical to be able to support Post Office in any litigation they choose to take against Post Masters should they uncover any financial
irregularities. As such, we took this issue very seriously and part of our rectification plan was sponsor an independent review. The
report from this review is attached and it is my intention to share this with Post Office. Prior to sending, could I ask you to assure
that there are no legal issues or consequences associated with the content of the review that need to be considered.

Thanks
