Dear all

As I think most of you are aware, the BBC is planning a programme on Horizon on Monday, alongside a debate in the
House of Commons. This will feature damaging and untrue allegations about our conduct as a business.

The team is seeking to ensure that colleagues have materials in order to be able to brief key stakeholders ahead of
the programme. I have alerted RMG and Bank of Ireland via my opposite numbers but clearly you may also wish to
ensure your key contacts are aware in advance of the programme.

I therefore attach a note which could be used as an email or speaking note.

On Thursday I plan to send a note to the GE, ET and SLT which will include an update, our rebuttal statement to the
BBC and a broader background note on this issue. We will be providing a script/lines to take for all customer and
postmaster facing colleagues.

I hope this is helpful. If you have further questions, please do let me know.

Best wishes,

Mark
