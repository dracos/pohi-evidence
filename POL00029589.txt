Ok here goes
Good call with Ss but James has definitely caused confusion with his cases or themes or topics etc.

SS have agreed they will look at 3 cases, they will tell JFSA which 3 cases to keep them on Board but ss
are choosing which

One of these will be dealing with the issue of remote access to a subpostmasters account, which James
specifically raised

I have just spoken to Lesley who has engaged Fujitsu today and is confident that within a week they will
provide evidence about access and audit trails etc

Lesley and I will meet Fuj on the 3rd to go through this, and then if we are comfortable go through with
SS and Fuj on the 6th, so let the technical people can discuss the detail

That's all the good news. 7
But I have heard nothing from Janet [I
conversation will have to be on hold
make some real progress with SS

so that
antime to

Hope that helps.
I am now working on the Mark Russell notes want to get them done before the weekend as they supplement
the Minutes.

Have a brilliant weekend I intend to when it arrives.

Thanks
