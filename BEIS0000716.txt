Slides for the home meeting attached as well as a letter from SoS to the CX on the GLO proposals.

Slides — we’ve summarised in slide 4 so that SoS can have a high level 1 pager in front of her and can focus on that

OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE
Hi Rose,
Thanks very much for this helpful write-up — and for your guidance ahead of last week’s meeting.
An update on the planned compensation announcement:

« The OC proposal of £600k remains with HMT. Their officials have told me that they are going to
recommend that HMT Ministers agree to it. We have prepared draft comms products, ahead of a
potential announcement to coincide with the Select Committee session next Tuesday, as SoS
requested. In order to get there, we will need help with No 10 (grid) and getting an answer from
HMT. Could you / Ellie consider contact your No 10 and HMT opposite numbers to explain that
our SoS would like to make the announcement next Tuesday and requesting their help on
clearances, please? Emily Snow in my team is talking to the Parliamentary team about whether we
should also request an oral statement slot, since I understand we need to tell the whole House not
BEIS0000716
BEIS0000716

just the Committee.

+ We continue to await a reply from HMT on the GLO-related ideas (fixed payment and scrutiny
threshold). I talked to HMT, as SoS requested, about the potential counterproposal of £75k for the
fixed payment, lower than £100k. They remain of the view that this wouldn't be acceptable because
the Chancellor’s concern is about the precedent, not the quantum. We need to decide whether to
write back at Ministerial level to request the £75k or not — it sounded like SoS didn’t want to write
unless we were more confident it would be accepted. Our analysts are working up the data and we
can offer a revised letter, if you would still like one, as part of the advice that you’ve requested below.

* On the GLO scrutiny threshold, we are expecting a reply from HMT early this week. Their officials
have told me that the CST is likely to agree the idea in principle but will say the threshold should be
lower than £50k (and tasking HMT and DBT officials to agree the specific number). This clearly
would reduce how useful the intervention would be and Ministers may wish to push back. Since we
weren't planning to announce it in next week’s package, it may be best to focus our efforts on the OC
aspect this week and write back to HMT on the GLO after Thursday's meeting to try to land a better
solution for that compensation scheme.

We are preparing to put up the draft comms products etc ahead of Thursday’s meeting and are in
discussion with corporate services colleagues about the Fujitsu points, so we can take stock with SoS then.
Many thanks,

Carl.

First up, a huge thank you to all those involved in the Post Office ‘Home’ team meeting yesterday. It was a really well
run session, which hit the perfect level of detail for SoS so thank you all very much.

Please see below the read out and actions from the session. Given our drop-dead deadline is having something to
announce before the Select Committee (which could be as soon as two weeks), we’re aiming to have a further ‘home’
team meeting on Thursday (with 15mins to cover the wider funding picture at the end). Will try and get that pinned
down ASAP.

Do let me know if I have missed anything or if you have any further questions.

Many thanks,

Post Office — ‘Home’ team meeting

Wednesday 6" September 16:45-17:30

Attendees:
¢ Minister Hollinrake
* Gareth Davies
* David Bickerton
* Carl Creswell (Director)
* Rob Brightwell (DD)
e Eleanor Brooks (DD)
* Beth White (DD)
e Ryan Hanley
e« PO

ACTIONS:

1. Post Office team to provide advice for Minister Hollinrake and the Secretary of State covering two
key points below by 9am Thursday 14* September. Please note that the Secretary of State has asked that
the advice provide options that she can announce before the next Select Committee (date TBC).

a. How SoS/DBT can speed up holding Fujistu to account for their role in the Horizon IT failure.
This should include litigious options alongside other approaches such as asking the company to
voluntarily and proactively provide funds and ending future HMG/ current Post Office contracts
with Fujitsu. Conscious the latter would have high legal risks but good to include given SoS’
ambition in this space. Please can this advice also be cleared/come with comments from Perm
Sec.

b. How SoS/DBT can best respond to the CX’s concerns about fairness and value for money for
the GLO compensation fixed price proposal. This should include exploring other fixed payment
thresholds, such as £75k or £50k, and assessing whether these would secure CX backing. N.B. SoS.
does not want to offer lower thresholds unless DBT can be sure that the CX will agree to them.

BEIS0000716
BEIS0000716

i.As part of this, the team should test new thresholds with Treasury officials to gauge
potential landing zones.

2. Post Office team to draft a response letter to the CX to be shared in parallel with the advice above.
This should:

a. Lead with the progress DBT has made in dealing with the Horizon IT failure so far, flagging
where DBT has been particularly effective in delivering for postmasters and vfm.

b. In line with the advice in 1b, defend our current position and/or offer alternative options to
speeding up compensation schemes [As above, SoS does not want to offer lower fixed payment

thresholds unless DBT can be sure that the CX will agree to them.] We should clarify the benefits
of the fixed fee approach (such as speed and less legal fees).

c. Include recommended approach in the advice (1a) that DBT will be using to hold Fujitsu
account - flagging the reputational savings for HMG as a result.

High level steers:

e SoS said there is more space for us to be punchier. SoS would like to see a markedly different
approach which prioritises getting compensation to those who are entitled to it as soon as possible.

e SoS agrees with Minister Hollinrake on the fixed price, with the underlying principle that it is more
important to get the money to people who were owed it than overpay some. There would never be a
perfect formula so we should prioritise pace and reaching those who have experienced extreme harm,
rather than stalling.

e SoS would like to have something to demonstrate the work we are doing in the next Select
Committee. She would like the advice to come quickly — demonstrating to Treasury (a) that we have
made progress and (b) that we are looking at other avenues, such as holding Fujitsu to account.
Continuing, SoS asked if we should include lower thresholds for the GLO schemes.

Good morning Emily,
Thank you so much for such speedy updates — looking excellent.

Only further comments:
1. GLO intervention (slide 14) — do we not have the CX letter, which we either need to respond to or organise a
meeting with?
2. On that note, do we have an updated draft of the letter or a slide in line with @Minister HOLLINRAKE (DBT)’s
comments? My sense is we should assume time in the meeting to have a discussion with SoS-Hollinrake to
agree whether to send a letter/have a meeting with CX, if they are agreed on fixed 100k.
3. Funding qs — would be ready to include a bit of colour/ context on the issues that Post Office faces and why it
is asking for such a big subsidy.

Subject: RE: [COMMISSION] Post Office - update for SoS DBT
Hi all,

Thanks so much for such speedy delivery on this — SoS will be really grateful. This is a great first cut of the slides.
Please see my comments below in line with SoS’ style/preferences for the ‘Home’ team meetings, hopefully helpful.

General
* Pedantic but important point — slides need page numbers as SoS will read through them and we need to all
be on the same page
* Would encourage having an agenda or contents to page to manage expectations for SoS and other Ministers
in terms of breadth and depth of presentation (i.e. how much we have to cover in the presentation — it would
be good to talk to aims of the meeting i.e. agree a way forward for speeding up the compensation schemes
(radically) and give SoS early sight on the funding and strategy requests for the Post Office that'll be coming
down the line and get any early steers.
* Asa rule of thumb it is helpful to assume that SoS is new to the details on all of this — particularly the
breakdown of the compensation schemes so would be ready to speak from a high level on this

Compensation schemes
© Structurally:
BEIS0000716
BEIS0000716

© You could swap 4&5 to give SoS background on compensation schemes upfront to contextualise
progress

© Slide 13 — you could weave the proposals into the main body e.g. the GLO claimants recommendation
into or just after the slide on live issues. N.B. it might make sense to more clearly split part 1 by scheme
with the recommendations following the progress slide of each scheme

* Slides 6,7,8 — data visuals are super helpful but might be goof to change the colouring so that it is obvious
whether it is ‘good’ progress or not — or be ready to speak to high level ‘good progress/ more concerning’ so
that SoS can get her head around it quickly

© Slide 9 — might be helpful to capture/ tease out what the blocker is to all the eligible claims being paid (i.e.
what is the problem we’re trying to solve when we say ‘speed up compensation claims’?)

© Slide 10,11,12 — the issue column is a bit unclear; ‘mitigation/Response’ — would be good to clarify what DBT
has done and then the outcome of said action. My sense is some of the terms are q technical (e.g. Submission of
350+ Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs)) so might be good to have a footnote at the bottom of the slide
explaining what it is

* SoS asked for a ‘red button’ option — can we more clearly sign post which policies being proposed are ‘red
buttons’ — my sense is this is the most important part of the presentation (a) what is the most effective policy
for speeding up compensation schemes and (b) how do we deliver on it so keen that we clarify that (we don’t
have to use the ‘red button’ term but just needs to be answering SoS’ question from the delivery meeting) and
as part of this (c) what do we need from SoS to do this?

Funding
* There are no questions/steers for SoS here? Is it worth testing the direction of travel here?
* Slide 16,17, generally — the phase 1 and 2 of the funding requests are quick to go into the technical detail —
could be worth making it more high-level/punchy on the headline figures, our assessment of how realistic they
are, and the timeline for responding to the requests.

Conscious these may look like a lot of comments but the content is all there — just suggestions on how best to land it
with SoS! Very happy to discuss these comments later over teams? Say 16:45? Let me know and I can send over the
teams.

Thank you all v much,

Rose

Thank you very much for your response below, and apologies for the cross over of our emails.

Happy to be led by you on the best approach for responding to the letter — if it is draft a response sooner than the

‘Home’ team meeting then that sounds good. Will make sure SpAds are sighted on the letter, who will want to review
our response letter before it goes to SoS.

The timing for the ‘Home’ team meeting is this Wednesday 17:00-17:30 07/09/2023, apologies that this has not been
sent to you yet. I will make sure you are on the invite.

Noted on the pre-meeting — perhaps we can aim to have sight of the slides Tuesday 12pm followed by a pre-meet,

then any changes can be made Wednesday before the meeting in the afternoon? Happy to bring timings forward if
manageable.

Hi Rose,
Thanks for passing this on. I can confirm that we have received the feedback from today’s delivery
meeting and are preparing draft slides for this week’s ‘Home’ meeting.

On correspondence with the CX, I have obtained a side-copy of the CX’s reply (though not the signed
version), as attached. I’m sharing it on a confidential basis because it doesn’t appear to have been
received by DBT formally yet. The reply is supportive in tone, but negative about the GLO £100k threshold
idea. We could either position our SoS letter as a pre-emptive chaser or a swift follow-up to the CX’s
letter. The substance for both is likely to be nearly identical and we have already started work on a draft. I
am assuming that Ministers will want to press the case again for the £100k threshold, as well as pushing
our other ideas. It may be wise for SoS to write sooner than our meeting.

I would be happy to touch on this in the margins of the SoS’s ‘Home’ meeting on regulatory reform, which
I'm attending later, if useful.

Could you also consider sighting Spads on the attached reply, in case they want to have a word with HMT
counterparts, please?

On the Post Office ‘Home’ meeting, I would be grateful if you could let us know when you have a time in
diaries, please. A pre-meeting would be helpful once we have draft slides, if that’s ok.

Hi all,

Thanks v much for the work ongoing on this. I just wanted to confirm (a) that this had been picked up and (b) make
sure that SoS’ steer on this in the delivery meeting have been picked up? These steers were:

1. To add in a ‘red button’ option for intervention in this space — SoS is keen to see an ambitious intervention in
this space (i.e. an intervention that would mean that DBT could do to get the compensation schemes delivered
in a matter of weeks/ASAP)
2. In line with this, SoS would like to write to CX or CST on the Post Office to request this ‘red button’ option —
could we bring a draft for SoS to review in the ‘Home’ team meeting please? Conscious that SoS recently wrote
to CX on the GLO so this letter would be an escalation letter/include options for speeding this up further.

Happy to be led by you if you think the next step would be to write to the PM.

Additionally, would be very happy to have a quick call this week to go through the above and answer any questions on
‘Home’ team meeting from content/expectation perspective if helpful? If so, let me know when suits and Ill make
some space.

Hi Carl, Beth, Eleanor and Rob

CC: David and his office

As previously trailed, SoS would like a Home ‘team’ meeting on the Post Office.
Please can we have slides that cover:

1. Horizon — (i) Update on delivery; (ii) timing of compensation reaching individuals.
2. The longer-term funding proposal from the Post Office - and recommendation from
Gareth/David.

It would be good to use this meeting to bring SoS up to speed on some of the background on the
Post Office issues — she has a high level overview and understanding, but she will be appearing
before the Business and Trade Select Committee where this undoubtedly will come up — and we
are expecting that SoS will want to be increasingly involved in the delivery of compensation over
autumn.

Some guidance on the slides: please ensure the slides include page numbers; and please include
questions on each slide - where steers from SoS would be helpful.

Deadline: SoS has asked for the meeting to be next week — we are working out timing but is likely
to be towards the end of the week. Please can you send up slides 4pm Tuesday allowing for
Gareth to review ahead of the meeting on Wednesday/Thursday.

David/Megan
Copying you into this, for awareness, and if you would like to attend the meeting David, please let
me know, this is optional, but you are very welcome to attend if so.

Hi all,
We updated SoS today following this update and your notes — SoS was grateful for the update but has asked for a
short meeting focussed on the Post Office next week. The meeting should primarily focus on (1) Horizon, but also

cover (2) longer-term funding proposal/settlement.

SoS remains very concerned about the speed of delivery on (1) and so wants to be able to get into the detail of the
current plans, and ask questions etc during the Home meeting.

Sharlene & Kieran in SoSPO will be in touch with an ask re slides for that meeting & cast list. @Minister HOLLINRAKE

Hi Sharleene,

We estimate that implementation of the fixed minimum payment would take 2-3 months. HMT officials
would require a new business case to approve the repercussive effects regarding the HSS. This needs to
go through internal DBT approvals prior to its submission. A Direction could be worked up alongside the
business case going through approvals so that once HMT have approved the business case, the Direction
can be issued and an announcement made. This approval window does however coincide with when we
expect to receive a significant number of claims which will need to be managed alongside the business
case.

Apologies for the delay.
Any questions let me know.
Cheers,

Josh

HI Emily,

Thanks for sending this over — really helpful. Just need the following clarifications before I can send to SoS:

* What would the window for the GLO announcement/implementation be for the fixed price be e.g. Is this 3
months minimum?

© As part of that what is the anticipated window for Treasury signing something like that off, and once
they do how long does it take to prepare a Ministerial Directive?

Many thanks,
Rose

Hi Rose,
Apologies for the delay, please see answers to your Qs below:
How quickly can we announce GLO intervention and how long until the money is in the pockets of the victims?

* This would be subject to what agreement is reached with HMT.

* If the scrutiny threshold is approved our intention would not be to advertise the threshold explicitly as to not
encourage inflated claims up to the threshold value. Instead, we would encourage claims to be submitted and
assess them swiftly to further encourage claimants to submit their claims. Policy documents are already drafted
so this could be implemented in a matter of weeks.

© The approval for the fixed minimum payment may take longer: it is likely HMT officials will want to discuss
further the repercussive effects and a Direction should it be required will take time to prepare.

* Both options require claimants to submit claims. At present, the Department has only received 26 claims
(some of which partial).

Importance of speeding up the delivery between OC and GLO

* We had a strong steer from Minister Hollinrake to speed up the delivery of both OC and GLO and the primary
driver behind this is that Government wants to see the victims compensated fairly and swiftly. There has also
been public commentary from the Inquiry, Horizon Advisory Board, Parliamentarians and the media about the
slow pace of compensation. There are some additional nuances between GLO and OC, set out below.

* The GLO has a statutory deadline to deliver all compensation payments by August 2024. This timeline
remains challenging but either of the options set out in the advice would relieve some pressure. Officials
continue to explore with PBL potential legislative options to extend the deadline as contingency.

© Minister Hollinrake’s view on OC is that it is not currently meeting the departmental objective of swift
compensation. Officials agreed with his view and recommended the intervention of the fixed sum to accelerate
delivery. Over 2 years have passed since the first convictions were overturned, with 86 overturned to date, and
only 5 full and final settlements reached. However swift progress has been made on non-pecuniary (personal)
damages with over 70 offers made. An additional driver is that the existing OC process is a complex quasi-
litigious process, which takes significant time to formulate and assess claims. This supports the rationale to
implement an optional, simpler route via a fixed sum.

Announcement

* Given the overlapping stakeholders and opportunity to announce a positive intervention, we think the
announcements would be packaged together. We will work with Communications with this in mind but if either
approval is delayed we may need to explore separate announcements.

Many thanks,
Emily

Hi Emily,

Thanks so much for your prompt responses. A quick question: if CX agreed with our approach on GLO — (a) how
quickly can we announce our intention to do this and then - more importantly - (b) how long until this money get into
the pockets of those who it is intended for?

Additionally, it would also be good to have a bit of the background on the importance of speeding up the different
(i.e. OC vs GLO schemes) and whether we’d announce our approaches to provide fixed payments at the same time or

separately?

Will send these additional updates to SoS tomorrow, so would v much appreciate some lines as soon as you can
tomorrow.

Many thanks,

Rose

need to talk to you and other private offices about some approaches we’re now using on information security.

Hi all,

I had a meeting this morning with the Secretary of State, which touched on: (1) Horizon - in particular the ongoing
work to speed up compensation for the GLO postmasters and (2) the broader long-term strategy and funding for the
Post Office. The Secretary of State was particularly concerned about the pace at which the compensation schemes are
being delivered and is keen to ensure we’re doing all we can to speed things up.

Conscious that Minister Hollinrake and Perm Sec have very much been gripping this, so my sense is we need a couple

of paragraphs to bring SoS up to speed on the following:
* Timelines/progress on speeding up GLO compensation schemes — this could include (a) where we are with

our proposals for Treasury and (b) what we could do to speed up WH decision-making to get the £100k.
Additionally, please do let us know if there is anything SoS can do to speed things up, or anything you need from
PO in terms of nudging CXO for a response to the letter we sent at the end of July.

© Itis worth noting that SoS is supportive of the £100k flat offer to GLO postpasters and is content to
provide a Ministerial Direction to see this get over the line. As such, it would be good if the update

focuses on how we can deliver this proposal.

© Update on the funding and strategy work for the Post Office — conscious this is very much a work in progress
(and in partnership with external consultants) but would be very helpful to understand the timelines for
developing a proposal for Treasury and how this might fit in with the Autumn Statement/other DBT requests

from Treasury.

Timings:
* Please can you provide a couple of paragraphs/bullet points on the above by Wednesday COP for us to share

with SoS?
I'd be really happy to have a quick call tomorrow/Wednesday to discuss in more detail — please do let me know if this
would be helpful.
Many thanks,

Rose
