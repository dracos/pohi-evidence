Steve rang me and apologised - apparently POL legal gave him urgent instructions to contact you. He
will make all further requests via Salford.

While talking I did find out that this request refers to the Rinkfield outlet - we provided approx 12
months worth of data back in February this year covering July 08 thru June 09, and Andy has provided
analysis of helpdesk calls.

Apparently this report is some 60 pages long and needs to be scanned! Steve said this was the same
expert covering Jon Longman's West Byfleet, although he didn't name him.

I wasn't aware of that, but it does make sense! Just as well I forwarded it on to you!
Steve rang me back to say he'd try and get the report.

steve,

All you've sent was a covering letter from Juliet McFarlane. I assume that there is supposed to be a
report for me to comment on as well?

I'm not aware of this case, but when I spoke to Charles McLachlan (who is the "Defence expert" for a
number of cases) last week he did mention that he was now involved in a case in Cumbria, so perhaps this
is it.

Gareth
