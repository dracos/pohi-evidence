Major Incident 9/5/16 — Branch Database

@ Background

Between Saturday 30th April and Saturday 7th May a business continuity test was conducted, to fail-over from Branch Primary
Database (BDB) to Branch Standby Database (BDS) under MSC 043J0444003-06, On Saturday 7th May the fall-back to Branch
Primary Database was successfully concluded and service was provided from the BDB throughout Sunday 8th May. On the
morning of the Sth the system was running on the primary database servers with the last known good configuration which had
been running successfully for the previous year.

@ Incident Summary

(On Monday 9th May 2016 from 08:55 to approximately 10:15 the HNG-X Branch Database Primary (BDB) incurred performance
degradation

At 09.20 a Fujitsu internal technical Bridge was convened to investigate the incident and implement corrective actions.

Following analysis it was recommended by the Fujitsu technical recovery manager that the Oracle Linux configuration item
“MEMlock” should be set to the same configuration parameters as the BDS server instances. In order to stabilise the service
and minimise any further impact it was proposed to cycle through the BDB nodes changing the setting rather than restarting all
nodes at the same time, as this would be less disruptive to service.

By 10:15 on the Sth May all 4 BDB nodes were configured with the new settings and service normalised

Root cause is still under investigation with Oracle. This is not a legacy issue as the Oracle 11 database, operating system and
hardware are still currently under vendor support.

Fujitsu and Oracle directors are engaged in daily conference calls to progress the resolution of this incident.

® Service Impact

The Horizon service was impacted from approximately 08:55 to approximately 10:15 as a result of the branch database
performance degradation.

The branch database experienced performance problems resulting in 65% of transactions failing over an 80 minute period

No liquidated damages have occurred ,4 SLA’s will be missed within this current period as a result of this incident.
