5.1 Board Mandate

The Chair introduced the Board Mandate, which had been drafted to set out the Board's role in
greater detail than was intended to be included in the Terms of Reference, to help the newly
formed Board navigate its role with greater clarity. The Board members discussed the mandate
and agreed that the additional detail and focus on achievement of the company’s objectives
through its people was helpful. They agreed to approve the mandate on the proviso that it
should be revisited in the autumn once UKGI had been operational for six months or so.

Action: to revisit the Board mandate at a Board meeting in autumn.

5.2 Chairman, Chief Executive, Company Secretary and Executive Committee —
Terms of Reference

The board approved the Terms of Reference (ToR) for the Chairman, the Chief Executive
(which included his objectives for 2016/17) and the Company Secretary. The directors
suggested that in addition to the Board mandate and Board ToR it would be useful to have a
NED ToR.

Action: to prepare a NED ToR for the June board.
