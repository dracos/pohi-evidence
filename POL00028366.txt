Andy,

As you probably know, one of the potential High severity acceptance incidents still outstanding
relates to the number of times that the system freezes and has to be re-booted before it can be
used again.

Pathway seem to be preparing a line on this (for Peter Copping) that the problem is only at the
level that we should have expected from a computer-based system, and is in line with industry
norms. We need to be in a position to refute this. Chris French is following up the line of
external benchmarking. In parallel, it would help our case if we could show that we do not have
this level of incident with our existing systems.

Are there performance stats, or help desk analyses available for ECCO+ and/or ALPS that
would show up the level of freezes and re-boots for our existing systems?

To be included in our inputs to Peter Copping, stats would be needed by mid day on Thursday
at the latest. Any info after that would be useful as briefing for Dave Miller in the meeting with
Copping scheduled for next Monday.

Per your request, please find examples of “systems freeze’ calls to the help desk over
the last 3 months re ECCO/ALPS platforms.
