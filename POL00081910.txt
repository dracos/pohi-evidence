Just reading the emails, I believe Peter is dealing with this in my absence, and to
avoid anyone going off at a

tangent he will drive any requests for information you may have through to the relevant
FJ staff concerned.

Dear Brian,

refer to Anne's email below.

M r Castleton has this morning made an application to resume the trial arising from the
late

disclosure of the document Anne referred to in her evidence. The application must be
heard by

21 December at the latest. In the circumstances, please can I ask you to supply the
document

immediately so that I can send it to Mr Castleton.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards.

do not myself have direct access to the archived system (Tivoli) event logs; they are

held by our Security

team and I have not looked at the logs for Marine Drive since 2004 (before they were
archived), apart from

checking 1st April 2004 following one of your queries the week before last. Until that
point i was not aware

that they were available. Obviously when questioned about them in court, I had to
acknowledge that they

were still available, even if not rechecked by me.
will make sure your request has been received by the Security team on Monday.

Dear Anne,

rstly, many thanks to you and Andy Dunks for attending Court to give evidence this
week

which was helpful. The judge has reserved his judgment which will probably be given in
the

new year. Thanks also to Brian and his team for helpf
the

y providing information about

lkirk branch on short notice.

In any litigation, the parties involved have a continuing obligation pursuant to the
Court rules

to disclose all documents that may help or hinder their case or the other side's case.
In this

context, a "document" means anything in which information of any description is
recorded, so

it includes, just for example, a computer database. Previously, I had asked Fujitsu to
let me

have all the info it had and had been helpfully given HSH call logs, transaction logs
and events

logs. I was also recently told that there was a message store which had everything else
on it

and we invited Mr Castleton to look at it this, but he didn't take up the opportunity.
However, whilst giving evidence you told the Court that there was also a different sort

of events log, not included on the message store, that we had not seen or disclosed for
the

Marine Drive branch. Mr Castleton has telephoned me today and asked for a copy of this
to

be supplied to him immediately.

The Court has ordered Mr Castleton to make any application for a resumed hearing
resulting

from the P.O's late disclosure of this document by 19 December. Going back to Court now
the

trial appears to be concluded is the last thing we want, but we will do this if we need
to. I am

not sure what application Mr Castleton would make. Possibly he may say his case was

prejudiced by not having this information made available earlier.
POL00081910
POL00081910

I anticipate that nothing will probably turn on the document you xr
you said

rred to because

it didn't contain any errors that would cause the losses, but the P.O are nevertheless
under an

obligation to supply it and if we don't, could face court sanction. Please can I
therefore ask

for it to be emailed to me as soon as possible on Monday morning so that I can in turn
send it

to Mr Castleton.

I look forward to hearing from you.
