His Honour Judge Richard Havery Q.C.

This is a claim by Post Office Limited on an account stated by one of its former subpostmasters,
the defendant Mr. Casdeton. Mr. Castleton admits that he was an accounting party. The
statement of the account, though not its validity, is admitted. Accordingly, the burden of proof
lies on Mr. Castleton to show that the account is wrong. On that point the law is clear. In Shaw v.
Picton (1825) 4 B. & C. 715, 729, Bayley J. said

       It is quite clear, that if an agent (employed to receive money, and bound by his duty to
       his principal from time to time to communicate to him whether the money is received or
       not,) renders an account from time to time which contains a statement that the money is
       received, he is bound by that account unless he can shew that that statement was made
       unintentionally and by mistake. If he cannot shew that, he is not at liberty afterwards to
       say that the money had not been received, and never will be received, and to claim
       reimbursement in respect of those sums for which he had previously given credit.

And in Camillo Tank Steamship Company Limited v. Alexandria Engineering [Forks (1921) 38 T.L.R.
134, 143 Viscount Cave, in the course of a dissenting speech, made the following remarks, which
I believe to be uncontroversial:

       The expression "account stated".....has more than one meaning. It sometimes means a
       claim to payment made by one party and admitted by the other to be correct. An account
       stated in this sense is no more than an admission of a debt out of court; and whilst it is


                                                                                                            A1.1 /30/1
                                                                                                               POL00004325
                                                                                                             POL00004325




             no doubt cogent evidence against the admitting party, and throws upon him the burden
             of proving that the debt is not due, it may, like any other admission, be shown to have
             been made in error.

2.   The accounts in this case are weekly accounts entitled Cash Account (Final), signed by Mr.
     Castleton as correct, of a post office at 14, South. Marine Drive, Bridlington, Yorkshire, of which
     he was appointed subpostmaster in June 2003. In accordance with the rules and practice of the
     Post Office, accounts of the transactions at the post office (which has been called "Marine
     Drive") were prepared weekly for the periods from Thursday to the following Wednesday. The
     accounts in question were accounts for weeks 42 to 51 of the year 2003/2004, which relate to
     the weeks ending Wednesday 14d' January 2004 to Wednesday 17th March 2004. The accounts
     built up substantial apparent discrepancies. The Cash Account (Final) for week 51 shows a
     shortage of £22,963.34. In consequence Marine Drive was closed all day on 23rd March 2004 for
     the purpose of an aud..it. That audit showed a shortage of £25,758.75. Mr. Castleton was
     suspended from his duties on that day. An additional sum of £100.20 is claimed in relation to
     National Lottery moneys. The total claim is for the sum of those two amounts, viz. £25,858.95.
     The burden of proof on Mr. Castleton can relate only to the figure of £22,963.34. In the event,
     as will appear, the identity of the party on whom lies the burden of proof is not important in this
     case.

     The first significant discrepancy appeared in the accounts relied on by the claimant in week 43.
     Thereafter significant f iither discrepancies appeared in weeks 44, 46, 48, 49, 50 and 51. Mr.
     Castleton gave evidence that the first discrepancy, of approximately £1100, appeared by week 42,
     but that he made it good out of his own pocket. I am satisfied on the evidence of Mrs. Catherine
     Oglesby, his then line manager, that he told her shortly before New Year 2004 that a shortfall of
     about £1100 had occurred on week 39 (the week ending 23rd December 2003). Nevertheless, for
     some reason that has not been intelligibly explained, the first and only explicit mention of the
     figure in the accounts is a reference in the print-out of the Final Balance (see below) for week 42
     of a "Discrepancy over" of £1103.00 and a "Discrepancy short" of £1103.60. The Payments
     column of the Final Balance shows a nett discrepancy of £0.60. Mr. Morgan did not accept that
     Mr. Castleton had. paid in £1100. I shall return to that point. It goes only to credit, since none of
     the Final Balances or the Cash Accounts (Final) from week 39 onwards show a nett discrepancy
     of that sum. Mr. Castleton promptly reported shortfalls in weeks 43, 44, 46 and 48. Mr. Morgan
     disclaimed any dishonesty on the part of Mr. Castleton.

4.   Mr. Castleton admits that on 23rd March 2004 there was an apparent shortfall in the account of
     Marine Drive in the sum of £25,758.75. He admits that he produced weekly Balance Ists (the
     documents in question are headed "Final Balance") and personally produced, signed off and
     submitted to the claimant Cash Accounts (Final) up to week 51. His case was that the losses
     apparently shown by the Balance Lists and Cash Accounts (Final) were illusory not real. It was
     entirely the product of problems with the Horizon computer and accounting system used by the
     claimant. The apparent shortfalls were nothing more than accounting errors arising from the
     operation of the Horizon system.

     There were two computer terminals at Marine Drive. Each computer terminal included a
     processor, a touch-sensitive screen, a keyboard, a barcode scanner and a printer. The laid down
     practice, in outline, was and is as follows. The clerk records on the computer all transactions that
     he makes. Transactions other than on-line banking are recorded not only on the computer but
     also by a document, such as a television licence counterfoil, savings bank deposit or withdrawal
     slip or a cheque. Some transactions are known as APS (automated payment system) transactions.
     Those are transactions where a customer either uses a card containing a magnetic strip to pay a




                                                                                                                 Al .113012
                                                                                                              POL00004325
                                                                                                            POL00004325




bill or pays a bill that is barcoded. There are corresponding APS slips recording APS
transactions. The subpostmaster is responsible for checking daily the computer records of the
transactions of the day against the documentation. He prints out the computer records of the
transactions, and when satisfied that they tally with the documentation he sends the
documentation in sealed bags or envelopes by the last collection of the day to the relevant
centres. He receives cash, stamps and other cash-type items from time to time in sealed bags and
has to record daily the amount of cash held by reference to the denominations of notes and
coins. The subpostmaster is also responsible for producing a weekly balance. There are in the
papers before me print-outs of weekly Final Balances for Marine Drive for the relevant weeks
and of Cash Accounts (Final) signed by Mr. Castleton.

Every week, after close of business at 5.30 p.m. on Wednesday and before opening at 9 a.m. on
Thursday, Mr. Castleton checked the stock at Marine Drive, as required by Post Office
procedures.

It is obvious that the week's accounts of a post office balance if the difference represented by the
receipts minus the payments equals the difference represented by the value of the stock at the
end of the week minus the value of the stock at the end of the previous week. If those two
differences are not equal, there is a discrepancy. If the former difference is greater than the latter,
there is a loss, which is treated as a positive discrepancy. If the former is less than the latter, there
is a gain. That is treated as a negative discrepancy. If

        An = the stock at the end of week n;
        R. = the receipts during week n;
        Pa = the payments during week n;
        Dn= the discrepancy for week n (positive for a loss, negative for a gain);
        Sn = the algebraic stun (i.e. the sum taking into account the sign, positive or negative) of
        the discrepancies for all relevant weeks up to and including week n;

then
        Rn-Pn - (An— An-1) = Dn = Sn— S0-1.

i.e.
        Rn+An-i + Si =Pn+An+Sn.

The weekly final balances produced by the Horizon system show both volume and value. I am
concerned here only with value. The balances are set out in the following way. First, there is a list
of the stock, described as "Stock & MOP" (cash, stamps, phone cards, postal orders and so on),
giving the value of each item and a total (An). There follows a list headed Receipts which begins
with an item "Balance brought forward". The balance brought forward is the sum of the
previous week's Stock and MOP and the accumulated discrepancies as of the previous week, i.e.
An-i + Sn-i. The rest of the Receipts column is a list of the receipts (R1) for the week in question.
A total, which thus represents R. + An-i+ Sn-i, appears at the bottom of the column. That is
designated "Total receipts". There follows a column headed Payments. That includes a list of
payments out to customers at the Post Office and remittances to central offices of the Post
Office. Those payments out and remittances are what I have designated Pn. In the same column
are included also the "Total Stock and MOP" (An) and "Nett discrepancies" (Sn). Those figures
are totalled to give a "Total payments" figure which is Pa + An + Sn. The nett discrepancies are
calculated so as to give rise to the same total in the Payments column as appears under the
Receipts column. There is then a figure of "Balance carried forward" which is the algebraic sum




                                                                                                                A1.113013
                                                                                                            POL00004325
                                                                                                          POL00004325




      of the Stock and MOP figure and the Discrepancies figure (i.e. An + Sn). The logic of the system
      thus requires that

             Rn+An-i + Sn-i =Pn+An+Sn,

      as it should. The entries (but not the balances and discrepancies calculated by the system) were
      entered by Mr. Castleton or his assistant in all cases at Marine Drive while Mr. Castleton was
      subpostmaster. He accepts, and indeed asserts, that they are correct. The correctness of the
      arithmetic is not in issue.

      Mr. Castleton, being alarmed by the growing discrepancies, was allowed by the claimant to put
      two accumulated discrepancies (deficits) into a suspense account. That was done by entering the
      relevant accumulated discrepancy as a fictitious expense in the Payments column of the Final
      Balance document. On each occasion the accumulated discrepancy was reset at zero.

10.   The figures in the weekly Final Balances were reflected in the weekly documents entitled "Cash
      Account (Final)" all of which were signed by Mr. Castleton as correct. The Cash Accounts
      (Final) showed the accumulated discrepancies appearing in the Final Balance print-outs. They
      also showed the suspense account figures in a table headed "Authorised Cash Shortages". The
      signed Cash Accounts (Final), unlike the Final Balance documents, included the authorized cash
      shortages in the Stock and MOP figures and in the figures carried forward (entitled "balance due
      to Post Office" in the Cash Accounts (Final)). The underlying logic of the two sets of documents
      was otherwise the same, and cannot be faulted.

11.   Mr. Castleton cross-examined Mr. John Jones, who had heard Mr. Castleton's appeal against a
      decision of the claimant to dismiss him, on some figures that Mr. Jones had produced for the
      purposes of the appeal. Those figures had been extracted from the Cash Accounts (Final). The
      point put by Mr. Castleton was that Mr. Jones's figures showed that the receipts for weeks 42 to
      51 inclusive totalled an amount less by £9240 than the payments, yet during the same period Mr.
      Jones's figures showed that the cash on hand (part of the Stock and MOP figures) had fallen by
      only £4700. Thus Mr. Jones's figures, far from showing a positive discrepancy (loss), showed a
      negative discrepancy (gain). Mr. Jones said that the figures were only an extract to show trends
      relating to cash. He did not rely on those figures in order to show that the shortage was a
      shortage of cash. However, in view of that line of cross-examination I have myself extracted
      from the Final Balances the relevant figures of Rn, Pn, An, An-i and Sn. They appear in the table
      below.

                                                                                                              A1.113014

      The last figure in the above table is the difference between the totals in the R. and Pn columns,
      representing an excess of receipts over payments. It will be seen that that, plus the diminution in
      Stock & MOP, equals the increase in the accumulated discrepancy. Thus no flaw can be found
      on this account in the Horizon system. The payments figure in week 47 includes an authorized
      fictitious payment of £8,243.10. The payments figure in week 49 includes an authorized fictitious
      payment of £3,509.68. Those two payments, totalling £11,752.78, were debited to the suspense
      account, and they appear as authorized cash shortages in the relevant Cash Accounts (Final). The
      total of the discrepancies at the end of week 51, namely £11,210.56, plus the amount in the
      suspense account is £22,963.34. Thus the accounts show that sum to be due from Mr. Castleton
      to the claimants. Since Mr. Castleton accepts the accuracy of his entries in the accounts and the
      correctness of the arithmetic, and since the logic of the system is correct, the conclusion is
      inescapable that the Horizon system was working properly in all material respects, and that the
      shortfall of £22,963.34 is real, not illusory.

12.   I shall nevertheless consider the points made by Mr. Castleton in relation to the reliability of the
      Horizon system.

13.   Mr. Castleton submitted that there were anomalies in the operation of the Horizon system,
      thereby implying that the system was defective. The first anomaly was a discrepancy between a
      computer print-out of all inputs to the computer and a figure produced by the computer. The
      former showed that at 17:41:30 on 7`h January 2004 Mr. Castleton (personally identified by his
      code) had declared (entered into the computer) a stamp total of zero. There were no subsequent
      relevant entries before 07:11 on 8th January. Yet the Final Balance printed out on 8`" January at
      07:11 showed a figure of £1183.22 for the stock of postage stamps (part of "Other postage
      items") and £1249.07 (total of "Other postage items") for week 41. There was no suggestion that
      the latter figures were incorrect. Mr. Castleton said that it was the former print-out stating
      "Declare stamp total £0.00" that was incorrect. (There was, however, an entry on the former
      print-out showing "Declare stamp total £1183.22" at 17:06:59 on 7th January). Mr. Castleton said
      that the figure of £1249.07 would show up as a loss on the next week's cash account. He said
      that the figure of £1249.07 was correct, but the zero entry would cause the computer to show a
      loss. As I understand his argument, the computer would do that because it would calculate the
      balance on the basis that the value of the stock of stamps had been diminished by £1247.09. Mr.
      Castleton submitted that the above matter led to the entry of "Discrepancy short" in the box at
      the top of the Final Balance for week 42. I reject that argument for the following reasons. First, it
      is abundantly clear that the computer did not calculate the balance on the basis that the value of
      the stock had been diminished by £1247.09. The figures printed out for week 42 were
      respectively £1041.96 (postage stamps) and £1094.82 (total of "Other postage items") which are
      consistent with the figures mentioned above for the previous week, allowing for the sale of some
      of the items. Second, the figure of discrepancy shown for the week was only 60p. In a box at the
      top of the Final Balance for week. 42 tha- figure is shown as the difference between £1103 which
      Mr. Castleton said he paid in and £1103.60 which is described as "Discrepancy short". The
      production of the box, which does not enter into the calculation of the final balance, is
      unexplained. Third, the figure of about £1100 was the shortfall that Mr. Castleton had told Mrs.
      Oglesby had occurred before the previous Christmas. Thus, whilst the entry "Declare stamp total
      £0.00" is not explained, I am satisfied that Mr. Castleton's argument is misconceived.

14.   The second anomaly on which Mr. Castleton relied was a difference between two figures of
      amounts of cheques. At 17:35 on 3d March 2004 a sales report printed out by Mr. Castleton




                                                                                                                  A1.1 /30/5
                                                                                                                 POL00004325
                                                                                                               POL00004325




      showed receipts of cheques to the value of £3533.30. At 07:37 on 4`h March 2004 in the Final
      Balance there was an entry in the Payments column "Rem out Data Cen £3519.43". It was not in
      dispute that "Rem out Data Cen" means remitted out to Data Central, a department of the
      claimant which dealt with cheques, and that the entry could only refer to cheques. Between those
      two times twelve entries were, according to the record, made in to the computer, but it is not
      suggested that any of them are relevant to the present point. This apparent anomaly was put to
      Mr. Jones, who simply replied that the sales report had no input into the final balance, which is
      obviously correct. But Mr. Castleton's submission was that the discrepancy showed an anomaly
      in the operation of the computer. I do not accept that that is so. The computer totals the receipts
      of cheques as they have been entered into it. There is evidence that clerks sometimes erroneously
      enter cash as cheques. But in any case, the figure does not appear in the Final Balance or Cash
      Account (Final). The error in the figure of £3533.30, if error it be, is not significant evidence that
      the Horizon system was not working properly.

15.   Mr. Castleton put forward a third anomaly. The print-out of inputs into the computer shows that
      on 14th January 2004 at 17:41:58 and again at 18:10:42 cash total £0.00 was declared. Mr.
      Castleton submitted that that could not have happened. The same print-out has the following
      further entries, among others: 14th January 2004, 18:27:54 "Declare cash total £81899.32"; on the
      same day at 18:43:14 "Report trial balance — Office copy"; on 15th January at 07:30:20 "Declare
      cash total £82997.32"; and on the same day at 07:33:17 "Declare cash total £83328.32". The last-
      mentioned figure appears in the Final Balance and in the signed Cash Account (Final). Mr.
      Castleton said that the figure of £81899.32 was correct and would have been entered into the
      computer by himself or by one of his assistants. He said that no-one would have entered a figure
      of £0.00: "It would be impossible for the computer to produce a report on it and not have it
      inputted on the other side", he said. By "the other side", I take it that he was referring to the
      Payments column in the Final Balance, which includes an amount for "Stock & MOP", which
      itself includes a sum for cash. The Final Balance and the Cash Account (Final) for the week in
      question (week 42) are based on the declared cash total of £83328.32. The point Mr. Castleton
      was making, I think, was that the record of inputs must be wrong in showing "Declare cash total
      £0.00". I have heard no expert evidence about the print-out of inputs into the computer. The
      fact that there appear entries "Declare cash £0.00" which have no apparent effect on the
      accounts is exiguous evidence that the Horizon system was flawed.

16.   Another point arises here. A print-out of declared cash made at 07:33 on 15"' January 2004
      shows a total of £83328.32. The individual amounts represented by coins and notes of specified
      face values are set out in the print-out in a list, and the total comes to £83328.32. A manuscript
      page of the stocktaking of cash also shows the amounts represented by coins and notes of
      specified face values. Those figures are the same as those in the printed list, with a single
      exception. The manuscript note shows a total of £161 in 50-pence pieces. The print-out shows a
      total of £1590.00 in 50-pence pieces. If the figure of £161 were substituted for £1590, the total
      would come to £81899.32, the figure originally entered at 18:27:54 the previous night.

17.   Mr. Morgan submitted that the figures shown in print-outs of stock of 20p. and 50p. coins for
      15th January 2004 were implausible. There is a print-out of declared cash as of 07:33 on 15th
      January 2004. That is shown as week 42, being before opening time on the first day of week 43.
      There is also a print-out of cash on hand as of 17:32 on the same day. Cash on hand was
      counted and recorded daily in terms of the total value of the items of each denomination. There
      is a manuscript note of the count of cash on hand which was the basis of the print-out. Taking
      the figures in chronological order, we have 07:33; MS note; 17:32. I set out the figures in the
      table below, together with the numbers of coins, which are not in the original data.
                                                                                                             POL00004325
                                                                                                           POL00004325

           MS               254.60             1273               161                322
          17:32             2654.60            13273             84.50               169

18.   It was said that week 42 had shown a loss of about £1100. The evidence is somewhat equivocal.
      Mr. Castleton wrote in his witness statement:

              Until Wednesday 14th January 2004 we balanced £1103.15 short we could see no reason
              for this at the time.

      Mrs. Christine Train was an experienced counter clerk who worked at Marine Drive at the
      material time. Mrs. Train wrote in her witness statement:

             When in week 42 we carried out the balance and the system shows [sic] a loss of around
             £1100 it was a surprise but we thought we must have missed a bundle of notes and a bag
             of coins. The cash was recounted but we arrived at exactly the same figure again......We
             were unable to identify the source of the problem on the following morning. Ultimately,
             Mr. Castleton had to make good the £1100 loss or so in cash from his own pocket to
             allow the system to balance and so enable us to roll over for the following week.

19.   The difference between the cash declared at 18:27:54 on 14th January and the cash declared at
      07:33:17 on 15th January is equal to the difference between £1590 and £161. Mr. Morgan
      submitted that it was implausible that Mr. Castleton should have paid in that sum, £1429, in 50p.
      pieces. He told me that they would weigh over 20 kilograms and, if placed in a pile, would reach
      a height of 5 metres. Moreover, I would add that all of them and more had apparently been used
      up by the end of the day. At 17:32 on the same day, 15th January, the value of the stock of 50p.
      coins was shown as £84.50; at 17:34 on 16th January it was shown as £78.50. Mr. Castleton told
      me (though not by way of his evidence on oath) that he had an ample supply of 50p. pieces.

20.   Mr. Morgan also submitted that it was implausible that the stock of 20p. coins should have
      increased by 11,885 over the day. He gave me even larger figures of weight and height. I accept
      that, especially given that the print-out of the cash on hand at 17:34 on the following day, 16th
      January, shows the stock of 20p.coins as having the value of £262.40. I am satisfied that the
      intermediate figure of £2654.60 cannot be right. It may be a mistyping of the entry into the
      computer. The error (and I am satisfied that the figure of £2654.60 must be wrong, whatever the
      reason) does not affect the weekly accounts. Nor has it been put forward as evidence of a fault in
      the Horizon system.

21.   Mrs. Train was cross-examined about her recollection of the payment in of £1100, specifically
      whether it involved a large number of coins. She was clearly embarrassed by the questions and
      gave no definite answer. I am not satisfied that the sum was paid in.

22.   During the hearing, Mr. Castleton sought to adduce evidence of other complaints from
      subpostmasters of other post offices about the Horizon system. I admitted in evidence the fact
      that there were a few such complaints, but I refused to admit evidence of the facts underlying
      such complaints, since that would have involved a trial within a trial. I heard evidence from
      Dorothy Day, who was currently the temporary subpostmaster at Marine Drive. She had found
      intermittent problems with the system. The most worrying and inconvenient problem was that
      debit and credit cards would intermittently fail to register when swiped through the gateway




                                                                                                               Al.113017
                                                                                                           POL00004325
                                                                                                         POL00004325




      keyboard to pay for customers' transactions. She found a way round the problem, though it took
      some time before it was solved. Mrs. Day said that she had now been at Marine Drive post office
      for about 2'/2 years and she was convinced that the problem was with the Horizon system. She
      recalled that in her previous post office, a small village post office, she experienced two
      anomalies that she could not explain. On one occasion she was several hundred pounds in
      surplus "which never turned up". The same thing happened again, inexplicably. Surely, she said,
      if she had missed inputting a Gyro payment or a National Savings and Investment payment
      someone would have missed it sooner or later?

23.   I heard evidence from Anne Chambers, a system specialist employed by Fujitsu, the company
      that provides the Horizon service. She has a working knowledge of the Horizon computer
      system used by the claimant. She said that calls from postmasters relating to potential system
      problems are initially taken and logged by the Horizon system Helpdesk. I accept evidence of
      Mr. Castleton that he contacted the Helpdesk over problems with discrepancies in balancing
      accounts at Marine Drive on a number of occasions. If the helpdesks are unable to resolve the
      problem, calls may be passed to the System Support Centre, where Mrs. Chambers works. In this
      case, her first involvement with Marine Drive was on 26a' February 2004. Mrs. Chambers
      examined the questions raised and concluded that there was no evidence whatsoever of any
      problem with the system. She was unable to identify any basis upon which the Horizon system
      could have caused the losses. Mr. Castleton cross-examined her about complaints from another
      branch, which he did not identify. She immediately recognized the branch with confidence as
      being a branch at Callender Square in Falkirk. The problem at Callender Square had, she said,
      arisen from an error in the Horizon system, but there was no evidence of such a thing at Mr.
      Castleton's branch. I found Mrs. Chambers to be a clear, knowledgeable and reliable witness, and
      I accept her evidence.

24.   Successors to Mr. Castleton as subpostmasters at Marine Drive gave evidence before me. They
      were Ruth Simpson, Gregory Booth and Mrs. Day. Mrs. Simpson took over Marine Drive as
      temporary subpostmistress on Tuesday 23 ' March 2004 and remained in that position until
      Wednesday 2151 April 2004. Mr. Booth acted as temporary subpostmaster from 215` April 2004
      until 28`' May 2004. Mrs. Day, to whose evidence I have referred above, became temporary
      subpostmistress from about 29th May 2004. Mrs. Simpson said that she had had no problems
      with the computers other than the usual trivial problems that one tends to experience with
      computers on occasions. In particular, when the touch-sensitive computer screen was dirty, it
      would not accept commands, and information had to be entered via the keyboard. The screen
      did not freeze, nor was there any failure of communication between the two terminals. She once
      had to re-boot the computer because the screen went blank. She did not remember any of the
      equipment being changed. There were no large discrepancies during her term of office. The
      maximum discrepancy was £101.95. She thought it might have been due to a pension having
      been paid out twice. The next largest discrepancy was £19.38. Mr. Booth experienced no
      significant discrepancies other than two which were deliberately induced to check the operation
      of the Horizon system having regard. to Mr. Castleton's allegations. Mrs. Day did not give
      evidence of having experienced any discrepancies at Marine Drive.

25.   Mr. Andrew Wise, of the Network Directorate of the claimant, had worked for the Post Office
      since 1991 and had a working knowledge of the Horizon computer system. He wrote in his
      witness statement that he thought that every transaction (apart from online banking such as
      withdrawing or depositing cash at the counter) recorded by the clerk on to their computer has a
      corresponding physical document, such as TV licence counterfoil, savings bank deposit [or]
      withdrawal slip or cheque. After explaining the matter in some detail, he wrote this:
                                                                                                              POL00004325
                                                                                                            POL00004325




             Accordingly, it can be seen that if the clerk or subpostmaster makes a mistake when
             imputing [sic: inputting?] transaction details into their computer, there are a number of
             points at which this can be picked up, because there are daily and weekly reports that the
             subpostmaster[s] have to produce at which stage they have to check and satisfy
             themselves that the physical documents evidencing transactions (for example, cheques,
             giros, pensions and allowances) match what they have entered on the system. In addition
             to that, there are various teams responsible for different sorts of paperwork produced by
             the branch, including a giro bank team, cheques team and pension team. For example, if
             the clerk records an item incorrectly on the system, they should pick this up on either
             their daily or weekly report. However, if they fail to do so, this will be picked up at the
             Processing Centre. If an item has been wrongly recorded, an error notice would be
             generated, although this can easily take up to 12 weeks or so. This will mean that if a
             transaction has been over or under stated there will be either a claim error or a charge
             error respectively.

      That evidence was not challenged, and I accept it.

26.   Only three error notices relating to the operations of Marine Drive during the period in question,
      apart from those mentioned below relating to lottery moneys, were in evidence. One error notice
      was reversed and does not form part of the claim. The others are charge notices totalling £292.
      They are not separately claimed: I assume that they are included in the audited figure. The
      paucity of their number is consistent with the proper working of the Horizon system. An error
      due to a fault in the Horizon system could conceivably be ignored by the ultimate interested
      party and thus not relayed to the branch as an error notice, but there is no reason to suppose on
      that account that such a fault exists.

27.   Helen Rose was at the material time an auditor employed by the claimant. On 23Ya March 2004,
      she carried out an audit at Marine Drive. That involved counting the cash and stock and
      checking the paperwork such as Giro deposits and withdrawal receipts, Pensions and Allowances
      Reports. She found that the branch was short of cash in the sum of £25,758.75. I accept the
      accuracy of her audit. Moreover, it confirms that the shortfall at the end of the previous accounts
      week was real. It has not been suggested that Mr. Castleton did not start with a clean sheet.

28.   There is a claim for £100.20 as the net receipts in Mr. Castleton's shop at Marine Drive of
      moneys placed in the National Lottery after close of post office business at 5.30 p.m. on 22nd
      March and during 23'd March 2004 when the post office was closed and the audit was carried out
      there. The till was in the shop, which was open at the material time. The claimant alleges that
      £176 was received at those times for lottery tickets, and that £75.80 was given out to customers
      by way of prize money. The normal practice was for those moneys to be taken into the post
      office accounts. That did not happen on this occasion since the post office was closed. The
      claimant claims by paragraph 11 of the particulars of claim a further adjustment to the account in
      the sum of £100.20. Before considering the merits of this claim, I shall describe the system.

29.   I read evidence of Mr. Michael Johnson, whom Mr. Castleton did not require to be called as a
      witness. He was employed by the claimant in the Lottery Exceptions Team. The following
      description of the lottery system is derived largely from his evidence. At the lottery terminal in
      the shop the customer pays the shop clerk for a lottery ticket, which is printed by the terminal.
      Details of the transaction are almost instantaneously downloaded to Camelot, which runs the
      National Lottery. The subpostmaster uses the shop till receipts to input the details of the lottery
      transactions into the Horizon computer terminal. Prizes up to a certain amount are paid out by
      the clerk on presentation of a winning ticket (not necessarily purchased in the shop). Those
                                                                                                                POL00004325
                                                                                                              POL00004325




      details are also entered into the Horizon system. Camelot electronically sends to the claimant's
      data centre details of the transactions for every relevant retailer. The information is automatically
      compared to the information received on the Horizon system from each branch. If there is a
      discrepancy, an error notice will be issued unless (not this case) the matter is dealt with directly
      with the branch. Mr. Johnson exhibited extracts from a spreadsheet taken from the claimant's
      Issued Errors Database for the Marine Drive branch. They showed a lottery charge error that
      occurred on 23rd March 2004 for £176, an amount by which lottery online sales had been
      understated in the receipts section. The money represented money that was received by the
      branch in relation to the National Lottery but not entered by the branch into the Horizon
      computer. In addition, a claim error notice was issued for £75.80. That represented Lottery prize
      payments that were understated by the Marine Drive Branch in the payments section. It
      represents a credit in favour of the branch.

30.   The Cash Account (Final) for Mrs. Simpson's first week as postmistress, week 52, shows that
      £2218.50 had been entered as the amount of the lottery ticket receipts for that week. The figures
      from Camelot of lottery transactions at the shop for that week totalled £2394.50, a discrepancy
      of £176. Those figures were broken down into daily amounts. The amount for 23`d March was
      £176. I am satisfied that that error arose because Mrs. Simpson did not enter the amounts shown
      on the relevant till receipts into the Horizon system. Similarly, the figure entered in the Cash
      Account (Final) as National Lottery prizes for that week was £5792.80. According to Camelot,
      the figure should have been £5868.60, a discrepancy of £75.80. Mr. Johnson said, without
      explaining the mechanism, that the figure of £75.80 represented National Lottery prize payments
      that were understated by the Marine Drive branch.

31.   The defence pleaded by Mr. Castleton's then counsel to the claim for £100.20 was

              No admissions are made as to the facts in paragraph 11, being matters that occurred after
              the defendant's suspension, and the claimant is put to proof of them but the defendant's
              liability is denied. Having been suspended as set out in paragraph 2 above, the defendant
              had no way of transacting those matters and/or the claimant's temporary subpostmaster
              had already assumed responsibility for the branch and/or the claimant's audit staff had
              balanced the accounts prior to her doing so.

      In his skeleton opening argument, Mr. Castleton said that the lottery moneys and terminal.
      receipts were given to Mrs. Simpson on the morning of 24th March. Although he wrote about
      Mrs. Simpson at some length in his witness statement, he made no mention there of any
      payment made to her or of the handing over of any documents to her. Mr. Casdeton was cross-
      examined about the lottery moneys:

              Q. Moving on to consider the National Lottery, am I right in thinking that you now
              accept that you received £176 on 23 d March 2004 in respect to National Lottery sales
              and paid out prizes of £75.80?

              A. That has never been in question.

              Q. Is that a yes then?

              A. Yes. It was never a question of receiving the moneys. The fact that repaid

                                                                                                            POL00004325




      I assume that it is payment to Mrs. Simpson that he was referring to in the above partly inaudible
      answer. He did not say that he himself had paid the moneys to Mrs. Simpson. Mrs. Simpson gave
      evidence about the subject of lottery moneys generally in her witness statement. The relevant
      paragraph, paragraph 11, reads as follows:

             There were two things at the Marine Drive branch that struck me as being strange at the
             time. One related to the National Lottery cash. The National Lottery terminal at the
             Marine Drive branch is in the shop rather than behind the post office counter. As the
             shop stayed open later than the post office counter, it would continue to sell lottery
             tickets, and this meant that before the opening of the post office business the next day, I
             would use the shop till receipts to input details of the lottery transactions into the
             I-lorizon computer terminal. When I came into the branch each morning, I would find
             the lottery cash that the shop had received overnight left in a bag just under the post
             office counter screen together with the lottery till receipt. I was therefore concerned that
             the lottery cash was being left unattended, because it was not secure and a customer
             could have taken it. On one occasion (I cannot recall precisely when), the lottery print-
             out (showing about £50 worth of sales) was there but there was no lottery cash. I
             therefore asked Mr. Castleton to make this amount good from the shop, which he did. I
             also asked for the lottery cash to be handed to me personally.

      I accept that evidence of Mrs. Simpson

32.   Although the post office at Marine Drive was closed all day on 23`a March, the shop was open.
      The sum of £176 must have been paid in by customers, and the prize money paid out to
      customers, between 5.30 p.m. on 22' March, when the post office closed, and 7.30 p.m., when
      the shop closed, and during the opening hours of the shop on 23Y`' March. Mr. Castleton did not
      put to Mrs. Simpson that he had paid her the lottery money. The nearest that he came to it was
      this. The discrepancy shown in the Cash Account (Final) for week 52, Mrs. Simpson's first week
      at Marine Drive, was £2.14 (Representing a loss of £2.14). Mr. Castleton put to her that she
      should have been £98 up. She gave a conditional answer that was inconclusive.

33.   In her witness statement, Mrs. Train wrote that she went through Mrs. Simpson's paperwork and
      found the lottery tickets loose in an envelope that had not been entered

             "which created the error notices. There is also a summary on which she wrote the amount
            of cash received from the shop on her first [day] in post. Not having a lottery terminal
            herself, she had made a mistake and did not account for the prize money already paid out.
            This should've been given back to Mr. Castleton or at least shown in the balance as being a
            gain but it was not".

      I have added the word "day" which seems to be required by the sense of the passage.

34.   The lottery receipts in question were not in evidence. Mr. Castleton, when cross-examined as to
      their whereabouts, said that they were in the post office. 'They were disclosed by neither party to
      the proceedings. During the course of the cross-examination of Mrs. Simpson by Mr. Castleton,
      the following exchange took place:

            A. So have you got the actual lottery receipts?

            Q. They are not in evidence, I'm afraid.




                                                                                                               A1.1 /30/11
                                                                                                               POL00004325
                                                                                                             POL00004325




            A. Right. Well I would want to see those before I made that (inaudible).

      When Mrs. Simpson was recalled for other reasons after the end of the evidence and
      submissions, Mr. Castleton indicated that he was in possession of the lottery receipts and wanted
      to put them to Mrs. Simpson in further cross-examination. On Mr. Morgan's objection, I refused
      to allow him to do so.

35.   Mrs. Oglesby invited Mrs. Simpson to run Marine Drive on a temporary basis to take the place
      of Mr. Castleton. She described Mrs. Simpson as a very experienced postmaster. I accept that she
      was, and I found her to be a reliable witness. If Mrs. Simpson had had the lottery vouchers at the
      material time and entered them into the Horizon system, the error notices would not have been
      generated. I am satisfied that the reason why she did not enter them into the Horizon system is
      that she did not have them. Moreover, if she had received the moneys, then given that she did
      not enter the transactions into the computer, the system ought to have shown a corresponding
      gain of £100.20. It did not. It showed a loss of £2.14. I-Iowever, that evidence is by no means
      conclusive since there could have been other errors.

36.   Mr. Castleton was suspended from his postmastership on 23 March. His duty to account to the
      claimant for the lottery moneys received on 23rd and 24th March in my judgement arises from his
      admitted receipt of the moneys. That point is not pleaded: but nor is the defendant's allegation
      that the moneys have been accounted for by way of payment to Mrs. Simpson. I am satisfied that
      the claimant is entitled to restitution of those moneys.

37.   There will thus be judgment on the claim against the defendant for £25,858.95. I shall hear
      counsel and Mr. Castleton on the question of interest.

38.   There is a counterclaim for damages in the sum of £11,250 on the ground that the claimant
      wrongfully determined the defendant's contract as a subpostmaster following his suspension.

39.   The defendant's contract with the claimant was a contract for services dated 18`'' July 2003. The
      contract provides, by section 1, clause 5, that the subpostmaster is required to accept full
      responsibility for the proper running of his sub-office. Retention of his appointment is
      dependent on the sub-office being well managed and the work performed properly to the
      satisfaction of the claimant. Clause 8 provides that the terms of the appointment of the
      subpostmaster do not entitle the holder to be paid compensation for loss of office. Clause 10
      provides for summary determination of the contract by the claimant in case of breach of
      condition by the subpostmaster or non-performance of his obligation; otherwise it may be
      determined by the claimant on not les than three months' notice. Section 12 clause 5 provides
      that the subpostmaster is held strictly responsible for the safe custody of cash, stock of all kinds
      and other property, papers and documents of the claimant, whether held by himself or by his
      assistants. Clause 12 provides that the subpostmaster is responsible for all losses caused through
      his own negligence, carelessness or error, and also for all losses of all kinds caused by his
      assistants. Deficiencies due to such losses must be made good without delay. Clause 13 provides
      that the financial responsibility of the subpostmaster does not cease when he relinquishes his
      appointment and he will be required to make good any losses incurred during his term of office
      which may subsequently come to light. Clause 15 provides that if a theft or burglary is
      committed or attempted at a sub-office.....the facts must be reported at once to the police and to
      the regional general manager. Clause 16 provides that if a sub-postmaster considers that any
      stock items have been accidentally lost or stolen he should make a report as quickly as possible
      to the Regional General Manager. There is no evidence of any such reports, and it is no part of
      the defendant's case that stock was lost whether by theft or accidentally. Section 15, clause 2,




                                                                                                                A1.1 /30/12
                                                                                                             POL00004325
                                                                                                           POL00004325




      provides that a subpostmaster will be required to make good any deficiency of cash or stock
      which may result from his assistants' actions. Section 22 clause 3 provides that the subpostmaster
      will be responsible for ensuring that transactions will be carried out accurately.....and that all
      documentation is properly completed and despatched at the due time.

40.   I am satisfied that the substantial unexplained deficiencies incurred in weeks 42 to 51 and in
      week 52 up to the close of business on 22 March 2004 are real deficiencies and as such are
      irrefutable evidence that Marine Drive was not properly managed at the material time. I conclude
      that the claimant was entitled under clause 10 of section 1 to determine Mr. Castleton's contract
      summarily for non-performance of his obligation under clause 5 of that section. Moreover, the
      losses must have been caused by his own error or that of his assistants.

41.   The counterclaim is dismissed.
