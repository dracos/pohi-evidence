Paula we had a better meeting with Ss this afternoon we pushed them hard to come off the fence and call
things by the evidence they have been given. I now think they will now call at least one case in our
favour, Rudkin and the comms failure. Although Rudkin is real our word against his.

The stamps case they are waiting for the spm to respond to them. I do not think she will suddenly admit a
mistake so my frustration here is they will not resort to the evidence.

The 4th case the scratch cards they have only just stared looking at.

The 2 incidents of 64 and 14 errors is where they will make a point on the system, although they will say
these have nothing to do with the cases and that we told them about them.

So I am in a better place with ss but I don't trust them not to flip again.
I will let you know how I get on with Janet on Monday

What a week. Have a good weekend

Sorry can't call I'm on the train

Thanks
Alwen
