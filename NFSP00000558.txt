The Chairman welcomed everyone to the meeting. The meeting would open with a
discussion in relation to the recent court case and the resulting Judge's ruling.

COURT CASE (see Appendix A for presentation)

CEO opened with a brief run-down of the past, the present and the future.

The NFSP had nothing to do with the case but got caught up in it. NFSP needed to
reassure members, branches and regions. May assist with ways to improve PO for the

benefit of the whole network.

Historically, as an organisation, network and market sector, things have gone from one
problem to another over the last 20 years.

A15 year agreement with PO was signed by the NFSP. That agreement was properly
negotiated, In response to a question as to whether PO could walk away, the response €
was that the only way would to be pay the balance of the money for the rest of the
contract. However that was not on the table or being looked at. It would be a breach of I
contract. Subpostmasters were investors In the network, and want PO to be both I
successful and viable. If they cut income they would not have a network. NFSP role and
aim, and no desire to have other organisations involved.

Made clear that it was a Special Conference overwhelming decision to adopt the MOU
and agreement with PO, Roadshows were held all around the UK.

General outrage that the Judge should see fit to cast aspersions about the NFSP who
played no part in the trial, gave no evidence, were not asked for documentation, or given
the right to defend ourselves.

The subject of mutualisation was raised. It had been part of the NT2 discussions but the
government did not deliver of FOoG. Income of PO fell and resulted in a change of
viewpoint and business model.

On the issue of the income guarantee for those who converted to Mains, many members
did not understand the offer which was that ‘they would earn no less as a Mains than
they would have previously’ with any shortfall being made up annually. Salaries were
compared on a like for like basis, so if an office had falling customer numbers and
transactions, they would have earned less as a traditional anyway. Some members were
wrongly blaming the NFSP.

There was wider discontent within the network. The finger could be pointed at
stakeholders - PO, RM and Government ~ as members feel let down. For some members,
they see the NFSP as being part of the problem.

Felt that there were many misunderstandings relating to the court case. Some believed
it was about Horizon however it wasn’t. The first case related to 23 common issues and
whether the contract was fair. The second case taking place related to Horizon.

Felt that PO had not helped the issue.

There had been no good reason to introduce the Grand Funding Agreement into the
court case.

NFSP neither supported nor opposed the litigation. There was no judgement against the
NFSP therefore there was no cause to appeal. NFSP could only use public opinion to
refute the Judge’s comments.

The NFSP had taken legal advice. Because the decision of the Judge had caused
reputational damage to us as an organisation, on that basis we could appeal. However, if
we did it would be prohibitively expensive, time consuming and the chances of success
were low.

Update was that the Judge had been asked to recuse himself from the second trial
which may result in a retrial. Questions were raised over his independence and started
with an opinion formed rather than considering the evidence hence creating an unfair
trial. This was very serious for the Judge. PO had yet to decide whether to appeal
against the decision. (I

Relationship was now on a different footing. There followed a discussion on mediation,
which was clarified. Mediation would come into play if, for instance, PO tried to get out

of the contract and all attempts at resolving the situation failed. It would then be
referred to CEDR.

CEO to make contact with CEDR to clarify the process with them should a conflict arise
in the future.

Judges rule was that the Contract was incorrect on 23 counts, Asked if the NFSP should
go to POL and say that the contract has been ruled wrong and ask them to amend.

To reassure members the Board needs to ensure they do not take a knee jerk reaction.
Have over the past year tried to bring some specialisation within the Board and for them
to understand roles and responsibilities,

The Board needs to support, help and respectfully challenge each other to ensure that
the representation the Board gives to members is the best it can possibly be.

One role was the Legal and Regulatory role. A role which is vitally important going
forward,

The Judge stated that the NFSP placed its interest above those of its members, we refute
that.

The Judge stated that business as usual work on the Website demonstrates our intent to
bolster POs position regarding transparency. We refute that.

He questioned that there was any appreciable negotiation regarding Network
Transformation contract. We refute that.

He questioned the NFSP not publishing the Grant Funding Agreement. We refute that. {
Clause 31 of the GFA deals with mediation. He made no mention of this in his I
Judgement.
Clause 31 also allows for escalations of disputes if an impasse is reached. i
Mediation can be internal or external.

NFSP wanis the relationship between Post Office and the Network to be a peaceful, joint
and cooperative one.

The NFSP does however have the opportunity to go external for mediation.

The NFSP as an organisation will support, engage and protect its members. It puts the
interests of members’ number one.

The person that takes on the legal and regulatory role will collect and collate all
members’ contract issues and any anomalies, inconsistencies that show up will be dealt
with.

Training will be given to those representatives of the NFSP to guide them at interviews
held between post office and members.

Will ensure there is a suitable escalation process in place.

Fundamentally the NFSPs ability to challenge the Post Office is already written into the
contact.

The CEO and the elected person to the legal and regulatory role will meet with CEDR to
establish the principals of mediation. This will be taken to Post Office and will report
back at Conference.

Nilesh Joshi was proposed to be the person to take on the role. The proposal was
carried at the vote. DECISION/ACTION
Anyone that deals with interviews will give feedback to Nilesh Joshi.

Support to be given to Nilesh Joshi.

Members to be advised that they can go to Nilesh and he can disseminate where
necessary.

Need to be consistencies throughout the network when interviews take place.

Would be very expensive to refute what the judge has said.

Decided to do a PR exercise to get the message out to members. .
A letter will be sent out with a Q&A providing information, clarification and reassurance ¢
on what the NFSP is doing. This was circulated to the Board.

Will have professional assistance on media monitoring and engagement to take control

of the external narrative.

The objective is to rebuff the Judges criticism of the NFSP.

Will communicate the positive advantages of being a member of the NFSP and focus on

the resources that the organisation provides in relation to the Mails and Retail tearms and

the Board.

UPDATE I
In relation to the mediation process. CEO had spoken to PO in the morning about the

decision made the previous day. NFSP would arrange a meeting with CEDR to set up
the principles of the mediation process.

Discussion in June 2018 with the Board (see Appendix C) about creating specialisation
on the Board and getting more involvement from Directors but recognising that the role
of Director is part time. Would like more involvement from the Board to represent the €
interests of members better. We want someone to deal with public affairs in relation to
local government, public affairs in Westminster and the devolved assemblies. Tim
Boothman is Chair of the Board of Benevolence, either Tim or Sue Edgar would be Chair
or Vice Chair with those roles and responsibilities. Additional roles for members of the
Board. If there was a role any Director wanted to take on, they should put their name
forward to the CEO and talk to him in relation to those roles. Only person who came
forward was Nilesh Joshi in relation to Legal & Regulatory. Looking for some help and
support. Want Board to represent the interests of members.

CEO would report at the pre conference Board meeting on the mediation and Board
would decide whether it should be announced. Purpose of the mediation process
clarified.

2. CEO REPORT

° The Director of Operation’s report had been circulated prior
to the meeting.

a) Political Engagement

Kelly Tolhurst, 25 February 2019

° Appears that Kelly Tolhurst ‘gets it’, and understands the
difficulties we face. She refers to subpostmasters as
‘investors in the network’,

° Presented the work the NFSP do with the Retail and Mails
Teams to support members and help them grow their
business.

° She understood the desire to protect’ members
investments. Government want fully viable Post Office, and
want it to ‘work’.

* — The government had invested significant funds and it had
to work. She sees the NFSP as part of the solution,

° We will continue to work with her and her officials to put
forward the network's narrative within that environment.

APPG, 26 February

° Attended by the ACS, Citizens Advice, FSB, Countryside
Alliance, CWU and NFSP,

e Rival organisation claimed that NT consultations were not
fit for purpose. Refuted by CAB. In 73% of cases they played
a significant part in the decision making process.

. Conversation moved on to points scoring. Brought in the
Countryside Alliance. We encouraged the ACS, etc, to get i
involved in the debate. Supporting of the aims of PO within }
the rural network, which was very different to the urban
network,

. Transformation programme on Crown offices being moved
into WH Smith. CWU trying to block the move.

° Postbank also raised by the CWU. Goes back many years,
and the banking market has moved on. It has had a
significant impact on the number of transactions within a
branch that was closing. Postbank would be going
backwards.

e As an organisation the NFSP need to be part of decisions
rather than go backwards,

. PO deliberately excluded from the discussions, If
performance ts to improve the relationship between PO and
the network and viability of PO overall. To try and move
without them being present was not the tight course of
action.

. PO would be invited to future meetings.

° Made clear that in some cases, CAB have blocked and NT
move and resulted in a spm handing in their keys to a total
loss of service rather than a move as there were no other
options, There should be a trade off as to what is best for
the customer.

Board Meeting 25 & 26 March 2019 Page 6

© National Federation of SubPostmasters

Need to get interested parties together and talk about the
way forward in those cases.

There were cases where PO wanted the branch to move but
CAB blocked it at consultation.

Comment made that they should get their MP involved.
NFSP policy was to protect our members investments, not
to protect the government's investment. They had invested
£2.4 billion up to March 2021. Maybe NFSP should be more
up front when challenging them.

There was a lot of work going on in the background, and
the government were not accepting everything PO were
saying.

NESP should shout about what it does more.

Royal Mail

Tim Boothman, Paul Simmonds and Calum Creenhow met
on 14 February to discuss mails.

Needed to know where they were with negotiations and
also had discussions on the Christmas performance, which
was 4.9% up on the previous year.

Christmas was the worst on the high street for 10 years. The
whole high street was down on trading. Post offices were
part of that situation.

As a single entity PO chased market share. 49 million
footfall.

Stalemate with negotiations. Nothing to update. PO
playing low key as RM did .not want exclusivity to expire.
Share price and brand had hit the floor. RM would look for
savings.

We met Stephen Agar and Anna Malley of RM. Not much
to report. Mentioned several times that RM wanted to
incentivise spms. When asked to expand they had yet to
work out how.

Belief was they were trying to play the NFSP off to make PO
the ‘bad guy’. Were also asking what PO paid spms.
Excellent work by the Mails Seg team. They were making a
difference to mail segregation. RM congratulated the NFSP
on the work being done. 4.9% difference to overall mail
compliance. £900k paid to spms last year. Hoping for
£2.1m for this year but awaiting confirmation. Achieved
letters and large letters. Closer to 1* and 2" class packets.
Challenging RM in relation to targets and how they are
recorded. Checking RM. Using data to identify anomalies
at a sorting office. Very close to all targets.

In response to a question clarified that PO and Payzone
were working as two separate businesses. Couple of
contracts had been won with exclusivity to the two
networks, Scottish Power was not on Payzone. Bidding as a
combined network, but currently some would be separate.

c) HMRC

° Applies to those on traditional/community contracts.

° Will take effect from April 2019,

. NFSP had negotiated with HMRC for 4 years, Intention had
been to impose in April 2017.

° NFSP had prevented that and negotiated changes to
reduce the impact on members as much as possible.

° Only applied to those on the old contract. Used to get
abatement for NI on staff and non-staff costs. Tax will be on
the same basis.

° PO say every office affected had been written to.

° Rent, rates, maintenance, electricity, gas for the year. Spms
needed to submit staff and non staff costs. Tax would be
calculated in a matrix style form and would be finalised at
the end of the year.

° Example: £4,000 per month earnings from PO
Staff and non staff costs submitted at £2,000 per month
Tax would be calculated minus the £2,000 and the rest
taxed.

At the end of the year would be the whole £48,000 for the
business to work out how much the spm should pay and
deduct the tax already paid.

° Fact sheet being prepared to send to every affected spm to
give to their accountant.

e Does not apply to those on Local or Main contracts.

d) Network Restructure

. PO restructured their respective sides of the business,

° Tom Moran leaving after conference. His remit would be
taken into Amanda Jones role.

e . NFSP told PO for a long time that isolation was an issue as
they only visited larger mains offices, Not good enough.

e Spms were desperate to have help and support.

. PO now have field team, 94 Area Managers with 9 Regional
Managers dealt with under Head of Agency. PO had
recognised that they do not serve their branch network well
enough.

° That included many processes to improve agency
conformance and engagement to try and reduce churn.

° NFSP would be involved to ensure it is done the best way
for the network.

. Focus was on customers. Want to ensure customer service
is improved and to protect the PO brand.

° PO want to intervene early to reduce losses and make it
easier to deal with situations. Previously it had been left too
long and losses were in some cases very large. Prevention
was better than cure.

° If a spms recognises that the shortage is due to their own
error or used for their own purposes, if they pay it back, they
are less likely to be terminated.

Board Meeting 25 & 26 March 2019 Page 8

° Pointed out that overnight cash declarations were not (
being done in many cases, or were being done wrong.
Some losses were huge and early intervention could reduce
that.

° Felt it was not the NFSP’s job to educate members on PO
processes. PO needed to get cash holdings for the whole
network sorted out. Could be sub contracted to the NFSP.
if PO in better position there would be more money in the
pot for the whole network.

° Felt that PO should ask offices to reduce holdings, and
needed to find out why a branch was holding too much.

. Contrary view that they the NFSP should never be in a
position to go into a branch and check cash. Believed the
NFSP should encourage all spms to do their cash
declaration so if there is a problem in the office, first thing to
look at is where the loss has occurred, Without regular cash
declarations it makes it difficult to identify when and why.
PO will spend time identifying where a loss had taken place € »
and when. Could be error or a bad member of staff. PO
would identify and down to spm to engage and they are
responsible, Without regular cash declarations it was
almost impossible. NFSP should be encouraging every spm
to do daily cash declarations.

° Felt that many did cash declarations but did them wrong.

° There was a long discussions with feelings running high on
the whole subject.

. Sue Edgar would raise the whole subject during a cash
centre visit shortly, Cash declarations used to be at the end
of the day, but with extended hours it needed to be before
19.00,

e) ATMs
e Major concern. Identifying issues and problems that could
develop in the network, Requested meeting with Wendy
Luczywo. €
° At the end of 2018/early 2019 there was a number of gas .
attacks on ATMs. Significant equipment and property
damage to those attacked. PO losing significant money.
° Impact on the spm. In some cases if badly damaged, BO!
not reinstating the ATM at all. If it was expensive to repair,
BOI were taking it out. Spm is left with damaged premises
and loss of ATM income.
. For those who had taken over a business, the ATM Income
formed part of their business plan.
. Became apparent that BOI have the right under the
contract to decide whether or not to reinstate an ATM. It
would be dependent on cost of replacement, reinstatement
and transactional volumes. .
° Contract with BO! runs out in November 2022. NFSP
believe it is part of BO! going to the PO to force them into a
renegotiated contract.

° PO and BOI must understand and take account of financial
inclusion.

e POCA only works in a BO! ATM. If a POCA holder needs
cash out of hours they will not be able to access if removed,

° Need to ensure transparency on decision making process
and we are part of the process.

° If BO! decide to withdraw, If they do, what happens to
services and spms? There must be a Plan B.

* Troy Gardner asked to look into possible alternative ATM
providers but the deal will never be as good as the PO one.

. Two offices hit in Thurnscoe converted to Mains in October,
Part of the business plan was the ATM income which was
now gone. Not covered by the income guarantee. The two
offices together do not come up to what was initial salary.
Losing substantial income from both the ATM and retail,
NFSP must push for salary top ups. Some ATMs were being
replaced. Needs to be consistency and some Pressure put
on PO to acknowledge its assurances is addressed within
the ATM sale. Even another brand of ATM will not allow
POCA access.

° Some offices were already struggling to survive. The whole
issue had to be taken up by the NFSP.

e PO had signed a bad agreement with BOI. It was a BO! I
decision and nothing PO could do. There had to be j
something they could do, PO should have a say. PO would
provide a waiver but the income would not be the same.

° When PO accept a new business plan, they were leaving
themselves open to being sued,

° Clarified that spms are not responsible for ATM losses after
an attack, however they would have to claim on their
insurance for any damage to the building so it was
important spms tell their insurance company they have an
ATM.

° Comment made that in Scotland they had to pay rates on
their ATM, so for some it would save money to have it
removed. However, loss of ATMs caused hardship
particularly in rural areas.

° Formal recognition on record for the work being done by
Paul McBain and his team to try and match the rest of the
UK and not pay rates on ATMs.

* Agreement to bank closures was predicated on the
availability of an ATM and that had to be taken into
account.

° Also noted that the rates issue was being contested in
England so it could change.

Mailwork (Tim Boothman)

Agreement reached with PO in relation to mailwork pay.

Around 460 mailwork offices.

PO put a proposition to the NFSP last May.

Currently paid Unified Scale relating to number of postmen,

excess attendance, number of vans, etc. Proposed pay to be

split into three main elements.

Property - calculated at £90 ft? x number of walks to cover

all the overheads

Supervision - number of postmen working at the office and

what spms have to supervise

Mail P739s - currently not paid for P739s. Increasing levels

now take up a lot of time and space.

Based on the current network and overall increase of £1.2m.

Some offices received residuum payment going back to

1999.

6O would be worse off with the changes but would get

compensation. Strong argument that for many years some

were paid more for the same job.

Removal of veto, Where RM want to remove mailwork the

procedure was to write to PO and request it. Steve Utting of

PO would contact the spm and send a form. If removed,

given 3 months’ notice and 18 months compensation. Long

process as spm could appeal on the basis the business was

no longer viable without the mailwork. Final decision

remained with Steve Utting.

Over the years many applications for a closure were refused.

Fear was removal of the veto would allow RM to commence

a closure programme.

Negotiation that instead of the local Delivery Office

Manager making the decision, it would be done centrally

and the NFSP would be involved in the process.

Some sites were operating as just a delivery base. Most of

the sorting was done in the main Delivery Office but

postmen use their facilities. They would have to choose to

opt out of that if a request comes in.

£1.2m was the first pay rise in 9 years. Costs were rising.

NFSP would have to wait and see. Could be RM want to

close them. Will need to be monitored.

NFSP had achieved with MAG a package in pace that is

acceptable for everybody.

Only concern was P739 offices. Signed for and Special

Delivery do not get scanned into Horizon. Appeared all RM

needed to do was to issue those branches with a PDA

(some had them already)...Customers sign the cards and

they are sent in each night to the local Delivery Office but

they do not have the manpower to scan i

Revised terms and conditions had been sent to mailwork
offices, They were office specific so they would know what
they were earning.

Compensation for a closure would be 6 months’ notes with
12 months compensation. If the office wants to keep the
P739 element they would be paid 12 months compensation
minus the P739 element.

There would be closures with the removal of the veto but
not wholesale closures. Decisions would be made centrally
not locally. NFSP would have an input.

Major discussion on the scanning of P739s into Horizon,

REMs

Some offices only had a REM every 2 weeks.

On the sealed PBN bags, notes had to be counted within
5 days. Unless notified within 5 days of deposit, PO would
not try to recover from customer.

If there was a shortage notified in 3-4 day limit is OK. If not
you have to count and report to REM unit if wrong.

Some offices did not check the sealed bags.

Only Santander have the authority. Has to be counted by
third day so bank can notify and claim from customer
within 5 days.

NC Facilitator position would be taken by Wendy Burke, so
issues should be notified to her.

hanked the Council for their support and questions

Formal vote of thanks recorded for exceptional service

to the NFSP over many years.

4, NNLs & HARD TO PLACE OFFICES

Report circulated.

On NNLs something had just arisen. Contacted by an office
with an NNL opened over a mile away and had no real
impact financially. However, RM had changed the
collection forward by 15 minutes to accommodate the NNL
and that has impacted their business, Their business
customers cannot make the earlier collection time. This has
not happened before but would be raised at the next
meeting.

RM have to get postmen back to the office by 6pm for the
mail to be sorted overnight and delivered the next day.
Postboxes had to comply and Regulator had to give
permission to change collection times, but postboxes were
different to a post office.

Clear that the situation differed around the country based
on local conditions and decisions.

On hard to place offices, Keith getting spreadsheet of all the
offices that had received a letter in February with the
continuation of the CRP.

The spreadsheet shows if they resigned, were they
continuing, if a PNO identified, etc. Shows monthly where
we are. 405 office to start with changed to about 30 every
month.

Currently and for 3 months about 10% (only 3 or 4) have
progressed to transfer.

Biggest drop off was offices resigning as they did not want
to wait. Difficult to argue against that. Disappointing for
them.

Work Keith had done was formally recognised, 405 people
in a community small business impacted by the situation.
In terms of number of post offices, it was a small number.
We are talking about people who invested and it is their
retirement fund. Need to ensure as few walk away as
possible.

NFSP agreed NT to protect the interests of members,
particularly those who wished to exit the business. CTP and
compensation in place only if a PNO is found. If they decide
to walk away, compensation is forfeited,

NFSP needed to push PO, When pushed they became
more considered. Feeling was that blockages may not be
there much longer.

Peter Hall's assistant George produced a report on seven
cases. Some people who walked away, some hard to place
and some we had helped. NFSP were doing all they could.
Report presented to Minister, who accepted and
understood our points. Need to move forward to help and
support these individuals, Many just wanted to retire,

There were cases where both NFSP and PO had worked
hard using all avenues, to get someone out in the case of
critical or terminal iliness by using a temporary. The illness
had to be formally documented. These cases were never
easy and everyone had to play a part in the solution,

There followed a lengthy discussion on the whole issue of
hard to place offices,

Anyone who was aware of a hard to place office or a case of
terminal illness should notify them to Keith Richards.

5. CONFERENCE 2019

Everything is in place for Conference,

If anyone else wants to attend they can only now attend as
a day delegate.

The CEO talked through the agenda and timings. He said
this would be sent to the Board.

The AGM will take place between 18,00 and 18.30 on the

6. ELECTIONS

Region Directors

There are four Regions where elections are taking place.
Two individuals had come forward for each of the Regions.
Of the eight, three are already serving Board members.

The other five, some of who have never represented

members at a branch or regional level, want to come in as a

Director. Need to provide help and support to those

individuals to ensure that they are fully aware of what their

responsibilities are. As a result Jim Nott, Nilesh Joshi and
the CEO will have telephone interview with them on 27th

March 2019, Based on that will take the elections forward.

e Timescale is that need to put together the nominations
with addresses to ERS. They will send out the ballot papers
to the relevant Regions on 10th April. Need to be returned
by 15th May and the results will be announced at the end of
May. :

° If a candidate is not suitable then they will not go forward. ¢
The Articles of Associate state that if there is only one
candidate then no election is required.

° Legal advice had been sought and followed properly.

° The point and intention of the interviews Is purely to ensure
that prior to anyone coming into the organisation that
person has an idea of what is expected of them and we
provide support and help to them.

° Members of the Board have a legal responsibility to
represent the members. . They must comply with legal
obligations.

° Board members should not promote another organisation.

* There should be no conflict of interests.

. Reported that previously a member of the Executive

Council had passed around to others outside of the Council

minutes of the meetings.

.

° New Chair & Vice Chair

°

* The CEO stated that the current Chair, Nilesh Joshi, had
been and excellent confidant for the CEO and a great
source of advice.

° There were originally three nominations for the position of
Chair. Saj Hussain dropped out as he had been nominated
to be Deputy Mayor, which will lead him to being Mayor of
Woking. The CEO congratulated Saj.

Boothman.

°

7. DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS REPORT

° The Director of Operation’s report had been circulated prior
to the meeting.

e Mails Segregation

° Paul Simmonds updated the Board since the circulation of
his report.

° Taking the average monthly performance before the Team
started and compared to the average of the last three
months. Ist Class Parcels were 90.4% now 94.5%. If you
take into account some amendments that need to be
made would be over 95%. Letter/ Large Letter has moved
from 85.9% to 91.7%. 2nd Class was 92.5% to 94.7%.

° Had a meeting with Julian King from PO regarding not
getting descriptive information on the error types. Julian
stated that they have exhausted all the avenues to get this
information from Royal Mail added.

° The data will show the primary error such as a Ist Class in
2nd Class bag but not the detail on what that parcel was i.e.
Freepost.

° Had met with Nick Landon, Chief Customer Officer, Royal
Mail. He said that Royal Mail are happy to supply the
information. Post Office are happy for the NFSP to go direct
to Nick Landon to ask for his assistance.

e The more information that can be gathered will put us ina
better place to achieve target next year.

° Have identified errors made by certain Mails Centres that
means that when adjustments are made to the figures they
will improve considerably.

. Intend to improve relationships with Mails Centres
nationwide.

° Will be running two sets of books for the next year showing
data we get and another one showing adjustments made
when errors are identified.

e There is not a lot of room for manoeuvre with the Mails
targets. If it can be proved the error was made by Royal
Mail then will question the data.

WEBSITE

° Data is currently being uploaded. Testing of the data will
follow,

° The whole digital project will launch around 19 April 2019.

. Members will get an invite to enter their details.

. Referred back to an email sent to members of the Board
that had Post Offices, asking them to log in and test and
enter some business information. Requested this be done
over the next couple of days.

° Now attend every Post Office Field Team meeting.

e A subpostmaster had saved £700 on their insurance by
getting a quote from SMEI.

how much money per year the Retail Team puts on to the
bottom line of members’ profits. Responded that a survey

° The more engagement with members the more the
likelihood is that they will buy into the products and
services the NFSP provides. That will generate an income
for the organisation and reduce reliance on Post Office for
funds,

. Board members need to give both Paul Simmonds and Troy
Gardner all the support they possibly can, particularly when
it comes to Branch and Regionals meetings and to involve
them.
