Dear Sir/Madam

Thank you for your letter dated 23 November 2006, regarding your client Mrs
Josephine Hamilton.

As the Royal Mail Criminal Law Team is now dealing with this matter, the
working tapes are held at their office in London. I note from your
correspondence that they were sent a copy of the letter and will no doubt
supply you with a copy of the interview tapes.

Yours faithfully.

Graham Brander
