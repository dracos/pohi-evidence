+ Full upgrade and house keeping of Athene Metron
completed with no service impact

*FS/POL capacity meeting reviewed current reporting,
amendments to PA/PER/033, and any improvements or
enhancements that could be by delivered by the service. A
new service impact review showed that the RBS transaction

Granular 5 min data charts have been extended to show 3 months back
data. Services overview report includes previous month summary page

The credence systems have shown increasing stability thanks to the
various joint initiatives between FS and Logica managed by Gaby
Reynolds and Melanie King

The HNG-X absorbed an increase of over 12 Million transaction from
April during the May trading period.

RBS transaction increase review requested that POL confirm the external 3 party data /network links sourced outside of FS management. To confirm

final service impact.
