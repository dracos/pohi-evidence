Jonathan,

Following on from our meeting yesterday, I attach Fujitsu’s powerpoint on Horizon’s Core Audit Process.

This was prepared to help the independent expert being instructed to support criminal prosecutions understand the
system, and may therefore assist in scoping any additional assurance work undertaken in connection with the Mediation

Scheme.

Kind regards, Rodric
