Re: POCL Infrastructure Segment 5
Bob,

I am now able to issue POCL Infrastructure Acceptance Pack - Segment 5. This
addresses all remaining Criterion except for the following: -

472/13 - Awaiting "OPS / TMS Acknowledgement Specification" document. This
is planned to be available within a week.

474/12 - Awaiting details of Weights and Measures certificate. I will forward
information next week.

479/5 - Awaiting Network Infringement documents.

I would also like to propose that criterion 476/1 be changed to Statement of Fact
or Obligation since it sets out pre-conditions that must be achieved before
Release Authorisation can be achieved and could not be proven in advance of
this.

I will endeavour to address the remaining criterion by the end of next week, and
we can discuss progress at our Segment 4 review on Wednesday. I can also
advise that the Segment 1 HSH visit is being condensed to one day on the 8"
June.

Regards,

Dave Cooke
