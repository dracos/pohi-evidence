Review exercises being conducted by this firm

2.

POL is conducting ongoing disclosure related exercises, as dscussed in the correspondence
referenced above. In this section of this letter we address ony current review exercises which
are being conducted by this firm for POL (i.e., not any disclosure related exercises which
have not been commenced nor any reviews that are being conducted by other firms).

Searches have been conducted across all ongoing review exerdses to locate documents
which refer to Mr Bradshaw, and/or which were sent to or received by Mr Bradshaw. For the
avoidance of any uncertainty, we confirm the searches were not limited to reviews that
specifically relate to Mr Bradshaw. To the contrary, a number of the reviews do not relate
directly to Phase 4 hearings and/or any other witnesses who arescheduled to give evidence
in the January hearings. Based on these searches, KPMG have identified 21 documents
which refer to Mr Bradshaw, copies of which are enclosed with this letter.

Of the 21 documents identified as relating to Mr Bradshaw, ve note that the tranche includes
organisational charts, lists of contact details, case summaries, spreadsheets, and pleadings.
None of the documents appear to be communications exchanged between Mr Bradshaw and
others.

Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
Note provided by Peters & Peters regarding disclosure by POL inrelation to Phase 4
hearings and witnesses
1. In its email dated 27 December 2023 (sent at 4:19pm), the Inquiry requested that all

outstanding material relating to Stephen Bradshaw to be providd no later than 4:00pm on
29 December 2023. POL regrets that it is not possible to make aformal production of all
outstanding material by that time.

2. The three audio tapes relating to Stephen Bradshaw's intervew of “Joan Francis Boiley”
(which it is assumed relate to the case of Joan Bailey) were sent by courier to a third-party
company for digitisation on 27 December 2023. The digitisation process was completed on
28 December 2023 in the afternoon and the audio files are currently being transcribed.

3. POL will arrange for the informal production of the transcribed files as soon as they are
completed. However, it will not be possible to make a formal production of that material until
the week beginning 2 January 2024.

4. In the circumstances POL anticipates it being possible to produce the three transcripts
informally, by email, on Friday 29 December 2023.
5. In respect of the additional checks for Stephen Bradshaw, rdating to potential additional

email addresses and display names, it has not been possible tomake progress since the
update provided on Wednesday 27 December 2023. That is because of the time needed to
migrate data to the CCRC workspace maintained by KPMG on POL's behalf. It is currently
estimated that the data will be available for review by the end of Friday 29 December 2023
(although that may be after working hours). Peters & Peters have a review team in place,
and, following the application of search terms, will start to review the material as it arrives on
the CCRC workspace. Should there be any new material identified of relevance to the
Inquiry, POL anticipates producing it as soon as possible in the week beginning 2 January
2024.

6. POL apologises that it is unable to meet the deadline set bythe Inquiry in respect of Stephen
Bradshaw.
