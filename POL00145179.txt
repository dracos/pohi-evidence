Once again, apologies for this, but I'm reassured by James' response that he's equally disappointed and will address it.

Hi Dave,

I completely understand and agree. This all appears to have happened very quickly but we cannot blur the lines
in this way.

This is not something I have ever seen before but I will speak with the team to ensure it doesn't again, my
apologies for any embarrassment this has caused.

I will have Mark call Steve so we get aligned.
Regards,

James

It's good to see action being taken around Baughurst which I know has been an issue for sometime. It's
therefore a real shame that I'm having to sour progress with this email, but I'm really disappointed to
see direct communication between Nick and our Network Director.

As you know these matters should be coming through my team I.e. Steve or a member of his team.

We should never be blind on any service issues.
Can I ask that you ensure we don't encounter such a breakdown in process again. Thanks.

Regards
Dave

Thanks. I've read the report and agree the approach.
If her and her staff are contributing to the issues then we will have to make this clear to her.

However this raises a question about the suitability of the equipment in terms of it's robustness,
ease of use, set up time etc and how could we improve the design going forward.

Kevin,

Please find attached the findings, observations and recommendations for next
actions based on yesterdays experiences at the Baughurst Store and Service
sites.

I have just received a call from Michele, the Postmistress, advising that the PHU
swap of today, in relation to the purple screen Michele experienced late yesterday,
went well and she has used the new Geller PHU prior to it going out tomorrow; and
all is well.

The replacement cables ordered as urgently required for the site yesterday
afternoon, have also arrived with Michele today.

If Post Office Limited can review the attached report and advise as to how they'd
like to proceed in relation to the findings, that would be very useful as I'm sure
we'd all like to see a conclusion to this one.

Best regards,

Nick Crow

Thanks nick,

The reason she has escalated to me months and months ago is because of the v poor
service she was and it appears is still getting. She can't operate a core and outreach service
and is very frustrated, understandably.

What are we doing to sort this our once and for all?

Thx

Good Morning Kevin,

In relation to the history of issues that Ms. Michele Middleditch has
advised she's been having I have been asked to quantify the actual
situation with respect to the reliability of the Horizon Outreach kit, the
environment in which it is being used and the actions of those who are
using it.

Having spent in excess of five hours out at the Outreach locations and
back at the Store location yesterday discussing the situation with Ms.
Middleditch, rather a lot has come to light.

Ms. Middleditch advised me that she is in touch with you personally
over this matter and I am aware that she called your mobile and left
you a voicemail yesterday. Having been present when she made the
call in relation to the discussions she and I had previously had I'd
suggest it would be better if I put together my notes so as you had a
record of the actual advice given and situations experienced so as
Post Office Limited are in a better position to move this forwards.

I will get them typed up and with you via mail today.

Ms. Middleditch has already been on the telephone this morning
advising she's having issues and I'm sure expected her own personal
Branch Issue Manager going forwards. Whilst I have taken on board
an action to look in to a possible technical issue, I have advised her
that in order to benefit from the best possible support and service she
should be logging the issue with the Horizon Service Desk so as we
are able to respond appropriately.

Best regards,

Nick Crow
