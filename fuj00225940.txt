this peak has been raised due to “Duplicate JSN” issue occured in BAL/OSR while processing "

abelEventService" request.

from the DB record, its been clear that JSN "2454507" was inserted due to request id "12136-1-PP-0809-10".

From the counter message logs, we could see that "12136-1-PP-0809-9" and "12136-1-PP-0809-10" both had same JSN, since "12136-1-PP-
jos09-9" was timed out.

| think this is the issue with late arrival of the request in BAL/OSR (not sure thogh).

landy has suggested to look into ACE blade logs, to check whether the OSR instances for which these requests had gone to were
histening/working normally.

{fo investigate further on this, I would like to have OSR message.log & osr-log extract for request ids "12136-1-PP-0809-9" & "12136-
i-PP-0809-10".

Analysis

2:18 Uscr:Jeevan Mithyantha

rrom the OSR logs, I found that retried "LabelEventService" request with request id "112136-1-PP-0809-10" executed before the
original request with request id "112136-1-PP-0809-9

ain this has happened due to some network glitch. And hence the arrival of the messages in BAL/OSR got delayed.

probable solution

in order to get rid of these kind of errors/exceptions due to delayed arrivals, we could modify the code in BAL/OSR side.

In MessageJournalDAO, if SQLException occurs (i.e. if a JSN already exists in BRDB, then system will check the journal xml contents
jonly if its a retried request.

instead, we could check the journal xml contents irrespective of retry or original request. If the contents are same, then we could
lavoid throwing exception from OSR side and could be ending up in a warning message.

nyhow, from counter side this won't affect anything, since original request would have timed out and retried one will be
successful.

[this peak has not been verified in 4LS CCIT due to the fact that it is not reproducible.
tn CCIT, this particular scenario can't be tested, as we can't reproduce the late arrival of the request in OSR side.

ut note that this has been successfully tested in the GDC DEV rig by using the Debug option.
