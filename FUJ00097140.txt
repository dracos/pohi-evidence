Importance: High

All,

For the avoidance of any doubt please ensure that this cascaded to all the teams. All the hard work and long hours of the past months has
achieved a position whereby we have entered into Roll Out.

Currently the deployment forecast is being impacted buy the ability of Post Office to get Branches ready to migrate. Collectively we must
ensure that this remains the case. So whilst the numbers quoted below are the plan I expect them to drop slightly at the last minute.

Please pass on my thanks for this outstanding result and the effort required to get us here.

Good Luck!

Regards,
Grahow

Importance: High

All,

I can confirm that we have received authorisation from Post Office Ltd to proceed to rollout of HNG-X Release 1 from Post
Office following the Acceptance Gateway 4 review and Release Authorisation Board earlier today. The rollout will proceed
with the following schedule this week:-

30" June 260 branches
4% July 261 branches
2°4 July 110 branches plus some additional migrations to be confirmed by Post Office 30" June.

This is a tremendous achievement for the account given the challenges of the last few months. We will of course continue
to maintain a high level of vigilance on system monitoring.

We will issue weekly progress updates on the number of branches migrated.
Thanks to all the teams involved for getting the programme to this point.
Regards,

Geoff
