POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST/SECOND ETC STATEMENT OF [Michael James Burton)

|, [Michael James Burton], will say as follows...

INTRODUCTION

| worked for Fujitsu for a brief period between March and September 2000. This was
nearly 23 years ago. | have had no reason to reminisce on my time there and my
memories are very vague. There is very little that | consider reliable enough to
recount under oath.

BACKGROUND

4

| believe | started working for Fujitsu in March 2000. | was sent on an induction
course in Birmingham. This was nothing to do with Pathway. I was originally
employed as a software developer floating between various projects. | was told
later | would be assigned to Pathway permanently.

. Although | was employed from March 2000, | remember a long period of time

before | had access to a PC connected to the Post Office network and | didn’t
have any work to do until — | think — late May 2000. This has stuck | my mind
because | was very bored.

. In all, | worked on what was called “Horizon” for about three months. |

remember it being a large store and forward system. PO counter staff had a
Windows NT4 PC with a point of sale app that captured transactions and
forwarded them to some central point over ISDN connections.

. | was expected to deal with fault calls logged by postmasters, most of which

seemed to involve me trawling through the raw data captured from the counter
computers. | did this for a short time and cannot remember any more details
or even why | had to do it.

. | left for a couple of reasons. Firstly, | didn't enjoy the work. Secondly, it wasn’t

giving me any marketable skills towards future employment.
