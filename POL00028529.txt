If: negotiations are to continue, POCL will need to be given a very clear and specific remit
by Government, and will also need to know how far the Government is prepared to help
through, for example, EEL adjustments:

« Difficult to envisage a deal acceptable to public sector side that does not include

= acceptance by ICL of a substantial share of the £121m (plus the contingency fund)

which they currently expect to be covered by price revisions within the contract;

- acceptance that Fujitsu cannot be allowed to wash their hands of the project as the
ICL proposals seem to envisage. Fujitsu must stand behind the project with funding

- and guarantees;

+ acceptance by ICL that if there are further delays attributable to them, they will be
* liable to compensate POCL/BA; and _
- acceptance by ICL that this project is simply too important to BA, to POCL and to
the Government more widely for the contractual acceptance process to be anything
less than full and. comprehensive (though that, of course, does not mean that itshould -
not be fair, nor does it necessarily preclude some element of independent

* assessment),
