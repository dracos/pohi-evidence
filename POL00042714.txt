7 at all. The point is extremely short. 35.14 expressly 7 as though there were also an application for the release
8 carves out an unusual and separate channel, which is for 8 of the security, but as I understand it, that’s no
9 experts to ask the court for directions. 9 longer live business for today. Is that correct?
10  MRJUSTICE FRASER: Yes. 10 MRGREEN: My Lord, yes, not for today; to be reserved
11 MR GREEN: Itdoes not provide or allow experts to do what 11 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Notfor today. It also at one point
12 happened yesterday. 12 appeared to be on today’s agenda the proper costs order

14 MRGREEN: It is just not right. So that is the short point 14 I understand it, that’s now gone away as well. Is that
15 on that. 15 right?
16 The other matter, I don't know to what extent, how 16 MRGREEN: My Lord, yes. The only point on that is that the

8 MRCAVENDER: Itisas it’s set out in the grounds there: 8 The point about this of course is that the court is
9 that the Common Issues trial that the Post Office 9 not in the business of making irrelevant findings along
10 prepared for and the court gave orders for was limited 10 the way. It makes findings and decides what the matrix
11 to the effectively preliminary issues on the meaning of 11 of contracts is because it is relevant to the matters it
12 the NTC and the SPMC and deciding the scope and extent 12 is engaged with; at least one can infer that

16 disclosure applications decided expressly on that basis 16 necessarily, given the nature of the exercise in
17 things like helpline, training, things of that kind. 17 a preliminary issues trial, as part and parcel of it.
18 Disclosure was not given on them and in fact was refused 18 ‘That's why this connects back to the error of law about

13 penultimate page. 13 subpostmasters, and a couple of paragraphs in our
14 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Yes. 14 submissions. So it’s a minimal point. But
15 MR GREEN: My Lord, bottom of the page, paragraph 153. 15 your Lordship is quite right, we lost on it, and that’s
16 1 don’t think it’s in any sense controversial, it’s 16 fair enough.
17 probably absolutely trite, but it’s obviously not 17 ‘The obligations which the claimants were seeking to
18 a simple mathematical calculation 18 establish by virtue of that relationship, the substance
19 MR JUSTICE FRASER: Thatis effectively accepted by the 19 of those obligations are reflected in the finding of
20 Post Office. They have very sensibly said they're not 20 relational contract. So for two reasons we say there
21 seeking a mechanistic issue by issue and it should be 21 that ona proper analysis, it’s more in the appearance
22 done by means of a percentage. 22 than in the reality of a win, but it’s fair to say they
23  MRGREEN: Exactly. 23 did win that issue.
24 MRJUSTICE FRASER: That is the modern way, isn’t it? 24 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Yes
25 MRGREEN: That's exactly right. But what we would go on to 25 MRGREEN: So, my Lord, that was the first point of

1 say, with respect, is: when one is looking at 1 principle
2 an percentage it is not a mechanistic approach either 2 Then the court obviously has in mind
3 arithmetically. It is not meant to be controversial 3 MRJUSTICE FRASER: What exactly is the point of principle
4 The reason I'm taking your Lordship to the authority 4 though? You're saying: not mathematical?
5 is paragraph 151 {7/8/44}, which is the alternative 5 MRGREEN: No, the point is that one should carefully have

10 the other. This is the distinction being made, to show 10 and this picks up I think on their NTC not incorporated

5 So, my Lord, we don’t say it all happens before and 5 a couple of paragraphs. If you look just in his

7 it should be indemnity costs. But notwithstanding the 7 his closing. In my closing, I don't know, it’s probably

8 justification for an order at that time, we say: given 8 a similar amount; in the opening similarly

9 that costs were budgeted from April 2018 onwards, and 9 So I don't invite you to go through page by page:
10 the certainty that that affords, on balance, it is not 10 it’s impressionistic. But my learned friend isn’t being
11 just and convenient to makea different order because 11 quite straight when he says it’s a couple of paragraphs;
12 your Lordship has already approved a costs budget, which 12 it’s rather more. So you ought to bear that in mind.
13 we came underneath. The cost budget was £3.4 million 13 It is true that if obviously a parallel point is won
14 and we were £3.1 million. So it doesn’t help anyone. 14 then it’s not mechanistic; I accept that, obviously.
15 So it’s not withdrawing from the submission. 15 But my learned friend says in relation to, for instance,
16 MRJUSTICE FRASER: When you say it doesn't help anyone, you 16 the onerous and unusual, it’s all is the same, Well, of
17 mean the cost management order doesn’t help anyone? 17 course it’s not the same because the terms under the NTC
18 MRGREEN: No,no,no, no. If we were to seek to invite 18 are very different to the terms under the SPMC. You
19 your Lordship to make an indemnity costs order, it’s not 19 have to consider each of the terms separately. You
20 going to makea material difference 20 can’t begin to say, as my learned friend does, "Well,

22 it’s not what you have been told. It’s at (B3/3/32} 22  MRGREEN: Yes.
23 I'm obviously aware that the pleading point didn’t find 23 MR JUSTICE FRASER: Right.
24 favour with your Lordship anyway in the judgment. But 24 What is there now? Payment on account and whether
25 actually looking at it carefully, if we start under 25 a detailed assessment should commence now or not?
13 115
1 “Implied Terms" at B.4. If you look at paragraph 58, 1 Submissions by MR GREEN
2 that’s pleading back to 106 in their defence. And at 2 MRGREEN: My Lord, yes. The short point is: those two
3 58.2: 3 points are interrelated. Payment on account would

7 already governed by the [thereto] terms ..”_ the 7 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Which one?
8 Claimant notes the Defendant's refusal to specify which 8 MRGREEN: The one about the benefit of cost budgeting.
9 of those terms are ‘already governed’ by the Defendant's 9 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Remind me of the name.
10 accepted implied terms.” 10 MRGREEN: That was in tab 23, it’s Macinnes v Gross, and it
11 So that’s the first point. It’s not that they're 1 was Mr Justice Coulson, as he then was. It’s {J7/23/8}
12 denying them. They're saying, “They are governed by 12 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Yes, you were taking me to paragraphs
13 Stirling v Maitland and the other term, but we're not 13 I think it’s 26 and 27 together, isn’t it?
14 going to tell you how”. 14 MRGREEN: Precisely.

13 90% point? 13 MRJUSTICE FRASER: That's going to be £17,738, isn’t it?

1 suggesting?
2 MR GREEN: Iwas suggesting claimants’ costs in the case but
3 if your Lordship orders costs in the case

4  MRJUSTICE FRASER: Let me hear from Mr Cavender.

5 Mr Cavender, what do you want to do about costs today,

6 what are you asking me?

7 MR CAVENDER: I rather thought they would be costs in case,
8 that’s what I would expect.

9 MRJUSTICE FRASER: I think the sensible and fairest thing

10 is to make them costs in case.
11 MR CAVENDER: The other thing is the date of payment of the
12 interim payment. Is it normally 28 days?

13 MRJUSTICE FRASER: No, it is normally 14.

14 MRGREEN: My Lord, that is what was agreed with recusal as
15 well

16 MRCAVENDER: Can we ask for 28? I have been asked to seek

17 28 days, so an extra 14 days. I’mnotsure that there’s
18 any real prejudice to the claimants. It is a question
19 of arranging the funds I suppose and talking to our
20 shareholder about it
21 It is only going to sit in the -- this is another
22 point I should raise, it is only going to sit in because
23 they have undertaken to keep it in the solicitor ’s
24 client account. So there’s that point.
25 Allied to that, in my leamed friend's order, so we
49
1 are clear, which is attached to his skeleton, in
2 relation to that he has a recital that the claimants
3 agree to hold and not disperse. I spoke to my learned
4 friend about this, he is happy that that be the
5 solicitors
6 MRJUSTICE FRASER: A fair copy of the order is going to
7 have to be drawn up by both of you reflecting everything
8 1 have done and I was not necessarily going to, unless
9 it was agreed, make recitals in the form sought by
10 either party to be honest because I am going to look at
it the recitals in detail, but you would rather that be the
12 claimants’ solicitors ?

13. MRCAVENDER: Yes, it has to be
14 MRGREEN: My Lord, the claimants were going to hold it by

15 their solicitors retaining it.
16 MRJUSTICE FRASER: So that is a non-point. Time for
17 payment you want 28 days?

18 MR CAVENDER: My Lord, yes

19 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Mr Green?

20 MRGREEN: My Lord, I'm not going to quibble

21 MRJUSTICE FRASER: You are either going to agree 28 days or
22 you would like to stick with 14 and then I will decide.
23. MRGREEN: I would like to stick with 14.

24 MRJUSTICE FRASER: All right.
25 Mr Cavender.

You can have 21 days

MR CAVENDER: I'm obliged.

Finally I’m instructed to ask for permission to
appeal against the ruling that costs not be reserved;
just that element. I do so on the basis, really two
bases, one is your Lordship identified a distinction
that applied to group litigation --

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Just before you do this, can I just make
an observation?

MR CAVENDER: Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: You haven’thad my detailed reasons. If
you make this application now your time will start
running to make the application to the Court of Appeal.
I'm very happy to hear you now.

If you wait until you have had the detailed reasons,
then you would be able to make the application in view
of the detailed reasons and your time would then run
from whenever you make that application. But if you
would like to make the application now I will hear you
now.

MR CAVENDER: Itis just a question whether your Lordship is
right about that because you have given reasons, You
are going to give

MR JUSTICE FRASER: All right.
that’s fine.

MR CAVENDER: I'm instructed to carry on with it. Two

If you want to make it now

151

bases, one was the group litigation was different in
some way and my analogy of preliminary issue was not
apposite and was not appropriate. In my submission
there is a real prospect the Court of Appeal may
disagree with that.

Whilst group litigation is a great thing and it gets
Common Issues together and it is a great vehicle and
there are special rules about it, they don’t apply to
whether the incidents of costs should go one way or the
other in advance when that would appear to be dependent
on how you group the issues.

What it will do, if it is right, is it will put
enormous premium in the future on agreeing particular
issues being hived off because parties won't want to
agree say just deciding the question of interpretation
if they think well they might lose on that but they win
on breach.

There will be an unhelpful tension in group
litigation and in people agreeing sensible things if
there is a massive cost consequence depending how you
parcel them. That's point 1.

Point 2 is that your Lordship relied on the Court of
Appeal in the David de Jongh Weill case and relied upon
that. If wecan return to that which is in bundle 1,
tab 7, paragraph 33. The thing about that that
