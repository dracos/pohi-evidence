Introduction

Balancing with Horizon

Welcome to ‘Balancing with Horizon’.

Most of you will know that before rolling out Horizon, we conducted a live trial

to understand the impact of automating offices. This trial identified a number of

problems, including longer balancing times and cash account errors in the first
few weeks afier the introduction of Horizon. This manual has been developed to
overcome these problems and to help make the transition to Horizon easier for
you.

During development, we spoke to subpostmasters, retail network managers and
Horizon field support officers about the problems they had experienced when
they started to use the system. As a result, procedures based on their practical
experience were developed to overcome these problems.

When an automated system like Horizon is introduced, it is very important that
everyone carries out procedures in the same way. This manual shows, in an easy
to read way, how procedures must be carried out. I am confident, that if you are
unsure how to carry outa procedure, this manual will explain how it is done. I do
not expect you to read it from cover to cover because it is really a ‘how to do’
reference to be used to help you with the daily and weekly procedures that will
change when Horizon is introduced at your office. You must follow these
procedures to ensure that you balance accurately.

I want you to use this guide as your first reference point when you have any
questions about or problems with balancing

Please phone the Network Business Support Centre o1

GRO _iif you have
any queries about this manual or about any business as usual procedures. For help
with using the Horizon system, remember to ring the Horizon System Helpdesk

Automation is something new that may worry a lot of people. Your retail network
manager and Horizon field support officer both have copies of the manual and
will help you through the early stages,

Finally, I would like to wish you good luck with using Horizon.

Practical tips when using Horizon

* tis extremely important that procedures are carried out in a consistent manner. This means that there
is one way of doing things and everyone must carry out procedures in the same way. This manual
describes how you must do this.

+ Alltransactions must be entered correctly into the Horizon system at the time of serving the customer,
unless the transaction is completed away from the counter. Always check the transaction on the screen
agrees with the actual transaction completed at the counter. It is much easier to correct an error on the
Horizon system while you have the transaction on the screen and the customer is still in front of you
rather than later when they have left the office.

* You should ensure reports are checked against the appropriate documents and that any errors found
are amended accordingly. These must only be ‘cut-off” when you are happy they are correct. You may
have to complete daily report procedures twice as no daily transactions can be held on the Horizon
system on balance day.

* The reports that are produced from the Horizon System are only as good as the information that is
entered into it. Therefore, you must check them carefully against the actual transaction documents to
ensure that all account numbers and amounts are correct. If any of the reports are incorrect a reversal
must be performed and another report produced which again must be checked. This must be done as
soon as an error has been identified.

+ For shared stock unit offices — When checking dockets against reports, you should keep the ‘cut-off’
screen visible. This will ensure that any transactions being carried out simultaneously at other
positions will not be added to the existing report you are checking. When you have finished checking
the report and have selected ‘cut-off’, any transactions that were carried out during this time will be
automatically added to the system and will be available for checking on the next report.

* When balancing Stock units, check that the Horizon System figures for stamps, stock and cash agrees
with the actual stamps, stock and cash on hand by making the necessary adjustments. When you are
happy that the stamps, stock and cash are correct, you must then roll over the stock unit into the next
Cash Account Period or Balance Period. All normal physical checks still apply when balancing your
stock unit.

* Adjustment of stock is the recommended method to ensure that system totals and actual stock
holdings agree. However an alternative method to stock adjustment is to make a stock declaration.

This means declaring your stock holdings rather than adjusting the system held totals. If you have used
the method of stock declaration and you subsequently need to make an amendment to the stock you
must re-declare the stock on the system.

* Once the office has been rolled over into the next Cash Account Period two Cash Account Final
Reports will be produced. One must be sent to Chesterfield, the other must be held at the office for 6
years. Ensure both copies are signed and datestamped. The cash account must not be altered in any
way as the changes will have no effect on the electronic version that is sent to Chesterfield.

Retention periods for supporting documents

* The retention period of supporting documents has been standardised. All Horizon reports and manual
forms that are required to be retained in the office must be kept for two years, with the exception of
the Cash Account report, which must be retained for six years.

Daily procedures and Horizon Reports

You must produce the following Horizon system daily reports at your authorised cut-off
time, for despatch on final postal collection:

Council Tax Schemes

Rent Schemes

Alliance and Leicester Girobank Deposits and Withdrawals
British Telecom report

TV Licensing report

UKPA (United Kingdom Passport Agency)

Produce Stock Unit Balance Snapshot (optional)

Remittances and Transfers (optional)

Please remember:

1

i)

You must check your vouchers / dockets against the Horizon produced report and manual summaries
to ensure the totals of values and volumes agree.

If you have other transaction dockets which are produced on a daily basis and for which there is no
Horizon system report, you should check them against the balance snapshot, but please note these
figures are cumulative during the Cash Account Period (CAP). If an error is found, refer to the
corrections section in this guide.

The balance snapshot will also enable you to check your cash and stock holdings on a daily basis if
required. If an error is found, refer to the corrections section in this guide.

. For shared stock unit offices — When checking dockets against reports, you should keep the ‘cut-off’

screen visible. This will ensure that any transactions being carried out simultaneously at other
positions will not be added to the existing report you are checking. When you have finished checking
the report and have selected ‘cut-off’, any transactions that were carried out during this time will be
automatically added to the system and will be available for checking on the next report.

Office summaries - Any office summaries undertaken prior to the production of the previous week's
cash account will not reflect the transactions performed in the current CAP. For example if stock units
have rolled into CAP2 and the cash account for CAPI has not been completed the daily office summary
will not reflect the totals for CAP2 until the cash account for CAP1 is complete.

Transfers

Transfers are the process for receiving and supplying cash and stock between stock units internally within
an office. Transfers are only normally applicable to multi-stock unit offices, as users attached to the same
shared stock unit do not record on the Horizon system transfers between themselves. However, if a single
stock unit office creates additional stock units for correction purposes or for ‘out of hours’ transactions,
they will automatically become a multi-stock unit office, and transfers may need to be recorded (see out
of hours and corrections sections within this guide).

For any stock or cash sent or received from an external source, the Remittance function must be used.

The supplying stock unit must record the ‘transfer out’ on the Horizon system before the receiving stock
unit can record the ‘transfer in’. If the receiving stock unit attempts to record the ‘transfer in’ before the
corresponding ‘transfer out’ has been recorded, it will be prevented by the Horizon system.

A stock unit can not balance and rollover to the next Cash Account Period untill all outstanding transafers
due to the stock unit have been transfered in or reversed by the sender.

Process for transfer out
* From the desktop menu select:

- Transactions (F1)

- Transfers (F2)

- Transfer out (E2)

- Select the stock unit that will receive the transfer and press (F1) to confirm
- Enter the stock / cash that is to be transferred out onto the system

Once all the stock / cash to be transferred out has been entered onto the system, the counter printer will
automatically print a transfer receipt. This must be signed by the recipient and retained by the supplying
stock unit until the end of the week. The recipient and the supplier of the transfer must check that the
amount of stock/cash agrees with the amount shown on the slip and that any discrepancies should be
rectified by a reversal and a re-entry of the transfer. The transfer receipt is then retained in the office for 2
years for audit purposes.

Process for transfer in
* From the desktop menu select:
- Transactions (F1)
- Transfers (F2)
- Transfer in (F1)
- Select the appropriate transfer (F1)
- Check the details on the screen are correct

- Print (F4)
- Accept the transfer and complete (F16)

The system will display a list of any outstanding transfers which are appropriate to that stock unit. It will
also inform the user which stock unit the transfer has come from and the total value of the transfer
outstanding,

Remittances

This facility is used by all offices when they receive/return stock, cash and cheques from/to, an external
source.

When you carry out stock remittance transactions it is vital to ensure that the correct source/destination
is selected on the Horizon system (failure to do so will lead to cash account errors). Listed below are the

remittance sources and destinations together with general guidelines as to when each one would be used.

Remittance sources

‘In Automated Distribution Centre (ADC)’: Used for receipt of stock, cash and POCL cheques. For
instructions on how to deal with remittances from the ADC (see Transactions - Other - Part one booklet;
Transfers & remittances; Dealing with remittances)

“In Client’: Used for receipt of National Lottery instants. Instructions on how to deal with Lottery instants
can be found at National Lottery Instants Received from clients, page 36.
Remittance destinations

‘Out Automated Distribution Centre (ADC)’: Used for when stock is remitted to Hemel Hempstead and
cash and POCL cheques are returned to the Distribution Centre. For instructions on how to deal with

remittances sent to the ADC (see Transactions ~ Other - Part one booklet; Transfers & remittances; Dealing

with remittances to the Automated Distribution Centre)

‘Out Client’: Used for when National Lottery instants are returned to the client. Instructions on how to
deal with Lottery instants can be found at National Lottery Instants Returned to Client, page 37

‘Out Data Cntrl’: Used for daily rem out of cheques which are sent to Data Central. Instructions on how
to rem out cheques to Data Central can be found at Cheques sent to Data Central, page 36.

You must check the vouchers / dockets against the Horizon produced report and manual summaries
to ensure the totals in value and volume totals agree.

. If you have other transaction dockets for which there is no Horizon system report, check against the

balance snapshot or miscellaneous transaction report, but remember these figures are cumulative
during the CAP If an error is found, refer to the corrections section in this guide

. If you have high volumes of transactions, the following reports can be produced on an ad hoc basis

throughout the week. It is important that you select ‘cut-off’ after printing any of these reports
otherwise the information in the report will be duplicated on any future report.

- Green giro Report

- P&A Report

- PO Paid Report (P490)

- DVLA V10/ V11 Reports (V594 & V595)

For shared-stock unit offices — When checking dockets against reports, you should keep the ‘cut-off”
screen visible. This will ensure that any transactions being carried out simultaneously at other
positions will not be added to the existing report you are checking, When you have finished checking
the report and have selected ‘cut-off’, any transactions that were carried out during this time will be
automatically added to the system and will be available for checking on the next report.

Section 3: Balancing and Suspense Account

Balance Day

On Balance Day you can prepare for balancing throughout the day in order to save time later. This should
only be done at quiet times and should not impact on customer service. The following list of activities
take you through a recommended series of steps which you can use as a checklist prior to and during
balancing.

Close of Business

Remember to switch on the A¢4 Printer and ensure that the printer has an adequate supply of paper
(approx. 25 sheets).

1&2. Complete Counter Daily Reports and Counter Weekly Reports

* The Daily Reports include the Daily Cash Declaration, in addition to the Declare Cash which is part of
the stock unit balance process

* All daily transactions, accepted after the authorised cut-off time, must be summarised and additional
reports completed before you balance with the Horizon system. They cannot be held in the Suspense
Account. This means that you may need to complete two daily despatches on balance day for some
transactions i.e. One when the postman comes at your cut-off time during the day and another at the
close of business before you balance, although these may not leave the office until the following day.
Even though the second despatch may not leave the office until the following day the summaries/
BCVs must have the balancing day’s date and week number entered on them or errors will be
generated.

3. Post figures to the Suspense Account (unclaimed payments and uncharged receipts) as
necessary and print report

* For details of posting and removing items to and from the Suspense Account, see the Suspense
Account section within this document

+ You must print the Suspense Account report before producing the Cash Account. In multi-stock
offices, only one stock unit will need to produce this report

* The only exception to this is when nothing is being held in the Suspense Account

4, Record non-accounting data (table 10g) and parcel traffic (table 12)
* From the desktop menu select:

- Transactions (F1)
- Non Accounting Data (F14) / Parcel Traffic (F15)

* This activity will need to be undertaken prior to the stock being rolled over into the next cash account

period

In multi-stock offices, non-accounting data and parcel traffic can either be entered individually by users
or the total for the whole office can be entered onto one stock unit. To prevent errors, i.e. duplication of
entries, it is recommended that one person/stock be assigned to enter the figures for the whole office.

5.

Produce Stock Unit Balance Snapshot and carefully check figures
From the desktop menu select:

- Stock Balancing (F4)
- Bal Snapshot (F5)
- Print (F4)

Check the Balance Snapshot carefully, ensuring that the system held stock figures match your actual
stock holdings. Use the adjust stock facility to rectify any discrepancies, see step 8. Adjust Stock on
page 66

Reconcile all receipt and payment transaction totals for which no report is available with the
supporting vouchers / documentation

Discrepancies with receipt and payment transactions should be rectified before proceeding further by
entering missing transactions or by reversing transactions entered incorrectly (i.e. overstated or
duplicated transactions)

Declare Non-value stock
From the desktop menu select:

- Stock Balancing (F4)
- Declare Non-value stock (F11)
Print (F4)

Enter on the system the total holdings of non-value stock items (note that non-value stock declarations
are carried forward from the previous CAP allowing them to be edited if required).

Offices with shared stock units will need to undertake more than one declaration if more than one
user has non-value stock to declare. In such cases, ensure that separate declaration ID numbers are
used for each for each portion of non-value stock.

Declare Stamps
From the desktop menu select:

- Stock Balancing (F4)
= Declare Stamps (F2)
- Print (F4)

Enter on the system the totals of each denomination of stamp (excluding Ist and 2nd class) held in
your stock

Offices with shared stock units may be required to undertake more than one declaration if more than
one user has stamps to declare. In such cases, ensure that separate declaration ID numbers are used for
each portion of stock

Adjust Stock
From the desktop menu select:

- Stock Balancing (F4)
= Adjust Stock (F4)

Check actual stock on hand agrees with balance snapshot
Any discrepancies should be re-checked before making an adjustment

Check that the totals shown on the ‘postage stamp’ figure on the Balance Snapshot matches the total of
stamps you have declared

Any discrepancies should be re-checked before making an adjustment

Page 66 horizon

4/5/64
POL00036884

POL00036884

horizon

+ If you adjust your stamp figure after a stamp declaration you will need to check your original
declaration and confirm it is correct, i.e. select the confirm option

Please note:

Adjustment of stock is the recommended method of ensuring that system totals and actual stock holdings
agree. However, an alternative method to stock adjustment is to make a stock declaration. This entails
declaring your stock holdings as opposed to adjusting the system held totals. If you have used the method
of stock declaration and you subsequently need to make an amendment to the stock you must re-declare
the stock on the system.

9. Declare Cash

* From the desktop menu select:

= Stock Balancing (F4)
= Declare Cash (F1)
= Print (F4)

* Enter your total cash holdings by denomination. Offices with shared stock units may be required to
undertake more than one declaration (i.e. where more than one user has cash to declare). In such
cases, ensure that separate declaration ID numbers are used for each portion of cash

10. View Discrepancies

* From the desktop menu select:

= Stock Balancing (4)
= Discrepancies (F8)

+ The system may display a list of cash and stock discrepancies

11. Ensure Shared Stock Users are Logged Off

* Before producing a Trial Balance Report, ensure that only one user is logged on to the stock unit (i.e.
the user who is producing the trial balance report)

12. Produce Trial Balance Report

* From the desktop menu select:

- Stock Balancing (F4)
- Balance Report (£6)
- Print (F4)

* Once the trial balance has been produced, check that all totals are correct.

* If totals are correct proceed to rollover (step 13. Roll Stock Units over into the next Cash Account

Suspense Account

Overview

Suspense Account is the section of the Cash Account previously known as Unclaimed Payments (Table 2),
Authorised Cash Shortages (Table 2A) and Uncharged Receipts (Table 3) (see below). This section
clarifies the reasons for using the Suspense Account and how to move items into and redeem items from.
Suspense. All of the icons which move products to, and redeem from the Suspense Account, can be found
by the following selection process.

* From the desktop menu select:

- Transactions (F1)
- House Keeping (F13)
- The relevant icon

Please remember: The products work ‘as matching pairs’ — whichever product you select to move an
item to the Suspense Account has a partner which you must use to redeem that item
from the same place.

For example: Within ‘Losses tbl 2A” one of the products available is ‘Loss A to Table 2A’. Its partner
within the ‘Loss rdmd’ option is ‘Loss A redeemed’.

If you do not use the icons in pairs it will create errors in your Cash Account.

For example: Potential errors following an incorrect Suspense Account transaction could result in
negative stock or inflated values.

Therefore extreme care should be taken when moving and redeeming items which have more than one
line on the Cash Account (i.e. Losses, Gains and RD Cheques).

Only the following items can be held in the Suspense Account:
Uncharged Receipts

+ Gains
* Rem shortages”
+ Migration?

*  Pre-purchaset

see Horizon System User Guide; Transactions - Other - Part one; Transfers & remittances; Dealing
with a remittance discrepancy.

The Migration option can be used by the Horizon Field Support Officer (HESO) at the time Horizon is
installed in your office, where products are not currently available on your system. If it is used, the HFSO.
will explain how to deal with any items contained within this section of the Suspense Account and will leave
a manual form (TP1).

The item(s) will need to be removed from the Suspense Account when the missing product becomes
available. Failure to remove these items from the Suspense Account could result in inaccurate calculation of
remuneration, and settlements not being made to clients.

The system will not allow you to balance if you are holding these items as value stock or methods of
payment (MOP). Therefore, you must move these items to the Suspense Account before the Stock Unit is
balanced and rolled into the next CAP. The items must then be removed from the Suspense Account the
following day. For further information, see Horizon System User Guide; Transactions - Other - Part tw
Miscellaneous; RD cheques, Vouchers and POCL cheques.

If you have any other products which you think should be moved to the Suspense Account, and you need

authorisation, you must contact the NBSC for the correct advice.

Dealing with losses — offices authorised to hold losses

Please note: —_This section is intended for branch offices and other offices that have received authority
from their Retail Network Manager to hold a loss. All other offices must refer to the

procedure described in Section 3: Dealing with losses ~ other offices

Any losses incurred within stock units that are not being ‘made good’ should be moved to the Suspense
Account (Unclaimed Payments) after the production of the final balance and CAP (not BP) rollover. This
must be done using the stock unit in which the loss occurred.

It is important that these instructions are followed carefully as offices that previously operated ECCO
would not have needed to post a loss to the Suspense Account prior to Horizon being implemented.
Failure to post a loss to suspense will mean that the loss will remain with the stock unit

Move any loss incurred to the Suspense Account directly after completing Stock Unit
Balance and CAP Rollover

* Enter the amount of the loss

* Select the Y option

* Select the ‘Finish’ option

* Print a receipt (by pressing the RECPT key) and attach this to the stock unit balance report

Please note: — The following activities are optional but will ensure the stock unit will commence the
new CAP with a net discrepancy of zero. You will need to undertake the declarations
before the stock unit is used for further transactions (i.e. perform the declarations either
that same evening or the following day - before any other activities are performed on the
stock unit)

Complete a cash and stamp declaration using the EXACT figures declared for the stock unit
balance

Please remember: When making cash and stamp declarations you must ensure that the figures are
entered against the appropriate denominations (e.g. declare 1p stamps against Ip, 2p
stamps against 2p etc) as declarations are transmitted to SAP ADS to be used for cash
and stock replenishment purposes.

be ‘cut-off” until the dockets/supporting information agrees with the report.

This type of error is corrected by using either:

* The reversal facility (where the original transaction has been entered incorrectly)

* By entering a new transaction (where the original transaction has not been entered at all)

* Combination of the two (reversing the original transaction and then entering the transaction
correctly). See Examples I to 3 below.

* Manually annotate the
original report with the
correct total and initial
the alteration.

If an Alliance and Leicester Girobank report is found to be incorrect after cut-off

Step 1. Reverse the incorrect transaction(s). For information on reversing transactions see the Horizon
System User Guide; Transactions - Other ~ Part «wo; Reversing transactions; Reversing Electronic
Point of Sale transactions.

Step 2. If the transaction was entered for a wrong amount re-enter it correctly

Step 3. Produce and cut-off an Alliance and Leicester Girobank report. This should ideally be done
before any further Girobank transactions are carried out so that the only transactions accounted
for in the report are the reversed transactions and any re-entered transactions that were required.

If the incorrect report has already left your office before any required corrections have been made:

* amend the offi

-opy of the report (the top copy of which has been despatched) to reflect the correct
totals. Associate the report produced in step 3 with the amended office copy
Please note:

Even if the original report sent to Girobank was incorrect making the correction in steps I and 2 will
prevent your office getting an error notice.

If the incorrect report has not left your office:

* Produce a manual Girobank summary (G6301/G6302)
Please note:
In this instance the manual summary will replace the system produced summary.

* Despatch the manual summary with the associated dockets as described in section 1

* Associate the report produced in step 3 with the manual undercopy.

Dealing with transaction reversals

If a transaction has been entered and the customer session completed, and you subsequently find you
have made an error, you can correct the error by ‘reversing’ the transaction.

Depending on the transaction, you can reverse it in one of four ways:
* as an existing reversal

* anew reversal

* a transfer reversal

* an automated payment reversal.

Existing Reversal

An existing reversal can only be performed on the stock unit that carried out the original transaction, and
only within the same Cash Account Period.

All transactions have a session number — this can be obtained from the transaction log.

+ From the desktop menu select: ———

= Reports (F2)
- Transaction log (3)

‘Yyeoeye ey ie
Transaction reversals can only be done whilst the EB eam peut we
voucher(s) are still in the office (e.g. Girobank ; oer ow
deposit error spotted before voucher(s) have ! mu
been despatched). BE

For information on how to complete an existing :
reversal on the Horizon system, see Horizon ial we URE

reversals — see below.

Redeemed Savings Stamp Reversal

You can only reverse redeemed savings stamps if you also reverse the associated product for which they
were accepted. For example, if you have redeemed BT Savings Stamps to reverse, you must also reverse the
associated BT Bill payment.

To do this you will need the session numbers for the transaction. If you do not know these you will need
to examine the transaction log.

For information on producing the transaction log, see Horizon System User Guide; Report

Administration reports; Producing a transaction log report.

Once you have identified the correct session numbers, proceed as follows:

* Select the existing reversal option

+ Enter the session number of the BT bill payment to be reversed

* The BT Bill transaction will appear on the stack

+ Enter the session number of the BT savings stamp payment to be reversed

* The BT savings stamp payment will appear on the stack

* To complete the reversal select the Finish option

* Once the transaction is completed a receipt is automatically printed with the reversal details

* The BT bill payment and correct method of payment must now be entered onto the Horizon system

New Reversal

A new reversal should be carried out only for any EPOSS transaction where the customer session number
is not easily identifiable. For example, when you have identified that an EPOSS transaction has been
entered incorrectly on the system and are unable to identify the specific transaction from the transaction
log.

For information on how to complete a new reversal on the Horizon system, see Horizon System User
Guide; Transactions - Other - Part two; Reversing transactions; Reversing Electronic Point of Sale
transactions.

All transactions which report to the receipt and payments tables of the Cash Account can be corrected
using the new reversal method with the following exceptions:

* Automated payments - see Automated Payment Reversal

* BT bill reversal - see Existing Reversal

+ Alliance and Leicester Girobank Deposits or Withdrawals - see Existing Reversal
+ Remittances in or out - sce Existing Reversal

* Transfers - see Transfer Reversal

‘Transfer Reversal

A transfer reversal can only be carried out on the nnn

stock unit which has transferred the stock out if
the receiving stock unit has not yet transferred in
the stock. This is performed by the use of a
session number, which is obtained from the

transfer receipt. The transfer receipt is printed
automatically when the transfer is completed.

For information on how to complete a transfer
reversal on the Horizon system, see Horizon

System User Guide; Transactions - Other - Part

Correcting errors found after stock units have balanced

and rolled over

This section tells you what action to take if you discover an error (prior to the production of the final
Cash Account) in a stock unit that has already been balanced and rolled over into the next CAP

To correct the error you must create another stock unit, called ZZZ, on which you make the
correction. This ensures that the stock unit can be easily distinguished from any other stock unit in
the office.

If you have found errors in more than one stock unit, you can use stock unit ZZZ to rectify all errors.
Create ZZZ as an individual stock unit.

Once created, stock unit ZZZ can be used each week to make any necessary corrections. If it is not used, it
can be rolled over using the inactive stock unit rollover procedure (see Horizon System User Guide;
Balancing; General stock unit activities).

If any errors are found after ZZZ has been rolled over another stock unit should be created in addition to
ZZZ. Additional stock units created should be deleted as soon as you are allowed.

Please remember:
Stock unit ZZZ must not be balanced until you have checked the office balance snapshot and are sure that
no corrections are required.

For information on how to create and attach yourself to a stock unit see Horizon System User Guide;
Office Administration; Stock unit administration.

For information on producing an Office Snapshot Report, see Print Office Snapshot Report on page 68.

See the examples below for details on what action to take when you discover an error has been made in a
stock unit after it has balanced and rolled over.

pir
Example 1 ~ Rod Licence not recorded on the system
Stock unit AA balanced and rolled over to CAP 20 showing a gain discrepancy of £18 in CAP 19.

- Whilst checking the Rod Licence weekly sales summary form P4678 against the office snapshot you
discover that stock unit AA has understated their rod licences by one transaction amounting to £18.

To correct the error create stock unit ZZZ and attach yourself to it
Enter a Rod Licence transaction for £18 and settle for cash
Declare stamps and cash as nil

Complete a balance on stock unit ZZZ — showing a loss discrepancy of £18 - and roll over the
stock unit to CAP 20

_ The loss (£18) in stock unit ZZZ compensates for the gain (£18) in stock unit AA

_* Complete the office cash account and roll over to CAP20
In CAP 20 ‘transfer out’ £18 cash to stock unit AA (do not physically hand over any money)

In CAP 20 attach yourself to SU AA. Complete the ‘transfer in’ of £18 cash (do not physically
hand over any money)

Re-attach yourself to stock unit ZZZ and declare stamps and cash as nil
Complete a trial balance on stock unit ZZZ

Stock unit ZZZ will show a loss discrepancy of £18 and a gain discrepancy of £18, giving a net
discrepancy of zero

When the stock unit balance is completed for stock unit AA it will show a loss discrepancy of
£18 and a gain discrepancy of £18, giving a net discrepancy of zero. (The net discrepancy of
zero is carried forward to CAP 21).

‘Out of Hours’ procedures

‘Out of Hours’ transactions

‘Out of Hours’ refers to post office transactions which occur outside of the agreed post office opening
hours, such as before the post office opens, during the lunchtime period or after the post office closes for
the day.

The procedure for dealing with transactions on the Horizon system which are performed ‘Out of Hours’
will depend on whether you have obtained permission to access the post office area outside the agreed
post office hours. If you are unsure check with your RNM.

A separate stock unit should be created to deal with all ’Out of Hours’ transactions. For ease of use and to
assist in balancing and cash account preparation, Lottery transactions should be performed using the ‘Out
of Hours’ stock unit, including those transactions which occur during normal post office hours of
business. This may or may not include Scratchcards, depending on local practices

* Create the stock unit following the normal procedure, using the stock ID called ‘OOH’ (‘Out of

Hours’) (see Horizon System User Guid
stock unit).

Dealing with lottery transactions accepted on the day of the office balance

Stock unit “OOH” must not be balanced and rolled into the next Cash Account Period, until all Lottery
transactions have been recorded on the Horizon system. This stock unit can be balanced on the morning
after the balance (usually Thursday morning).

* On balance day: Balance all stock units except the ‘OOH’ and any correction stock units. Roll all stock
units except the OOH stock unit into the next Cash Account Period, as normal. (see Horizon System
User Guide; Balancing; General stock unit activities)

Once these stock units have been rolled into the next Cash Account Period, they will be available for use
on the next working day, even if the Cash Account has not been produced.

* The ‘OOH’ stock unit must be kept in the current Cash Account Period (CAP) for the purpose of
recording the out of hours transactions

+ After the Lottery cut-off, follow the procedure for dealing with Lottery transactions at the end of the
day (‘Dealing with transactions accepted on days other than the day of the office balance’)
