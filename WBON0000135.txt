Acouple of optional tweaks attached in the "Live Data" section.

If I've understood this correctly, we're saying that the email proposal had nothing to do with branch accounting. If so, I
recommend eliminating any suggestion that this proposal would impact on branches.

Kind regards

Andy,

Can you please have a look at this, focussing on the "access to live data" section to see that it's consistent with our
approach to the Spot Reviews to date.

Thanks, Rod

Thanks for all the comments on the letter. I have attached a third draft which I hope is final. It has added an
important section on the exceptions which I need clearing and comments from all those copied, tonight or first
thing tomorrow if possible please (and sorry).

I also need to know if we have agreed the definition of Horizon point with SS?
