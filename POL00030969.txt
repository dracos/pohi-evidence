1 « Overview

1.1. Introduction by the Policy Owner

The General Counsel has overall accountability to the Board of Directors for the
implementation of controls ensuring Post Office meets it Whistleblowing obligations.
Whistleblowing is an agenda item for the Audit and Risk Committee and the Post Office
board is updated as required.

1.2. Purpose

This Policy has been established to set the minimum operating standards relating to the
management of Whistleblowing throughout the Group!. It is one of a set of policies which
provide a clear risk and governance framework and an effective system of internal control
for the management of risk across the Group. Compliance with these policies supports the
Group in meeting its business objectives and to balance the needs of shareholders,
employees? and other stakeholders.

1.3. Core Principles

Whistleblowing is the reporting of suspected wrongdoing and/or dangerous practices
within Post Office. This would include serious accidents, fraud, regulatory breaches,
financial impropriety and/or reputational damage.

In order to encourage Whistleblowing and provide appropriate protections to
whistleblowers, the governance arrangements described in this Policy are based upon the
following core principles:

« To encourage the reporting of any concerns as soon as possible in the knowledge that
all concerns will be taken seriously and investigated, and that confidentiality will be
respected;

* To provide guidance as to how to raise those concerns;

e To provide whistleblowers reassurance that all concerns are raised without fear of
reprisals, even if they turn out to be mistaken;

e Post Office is committed to and oversees the implementation of a Policy in line with
the Group’s risk appetite. The Policy and associated procedures (set out or referred to
in this document) are proportionate to the risks and complexity of the Group;

e Post Office undertakes a training and awareness program to ensure employees are
aware of the Whistleblowing policy and procedure.

1.4. Application

This Policy is applicable to all employees within the Group and outlines the protections
provided for whistleblowers by law. In order to encourage reporting of wrongdoing, Post
Office will, where appropriate, extend equivalent protection to Postmasters, Agent
Assistants, and members of the public.

‘In this Policy “Post Office” and “Group” mean Post Office Limited and Post Office Management Services Limited.
2 In this Policy “employee” means permanent staff, temporary including agency staff, contractors, consultants and anyone else
working for or on behalf of Post Office.

POL00030969
POL00030969

1.5. Legislation

The Group seeks to comply with all relevant UK legal and regulatory requirements
including (but not limited to) the following legislation as amended or supplemented from
time to time:

« Employment Rights Act 1996
« Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998

1.6. What is Whistleblowing

“Whistleblowing” refers to the act of exposing potential or actual wrongdoing and/or
dangerous practices by reporting it either internally within an organisation, or to an
external party. A whistleblower is a person who raises a genuine concern in relation to any
wrongdoing, this includes criminal activity, miscarriages of justice, dangers to health and
safety and the deliberate attempt to conceal it.

Individuals? should raise a concern if they are aware of, or suspect, wrongdoing which
affects others (e.g. customers, members of the public, colleagues or the Post Office). The
following lists some examples (this is a non-exhaustive list) of situations where an
individual may raise a concern:

« Financial Crime including Fraud, Money Laundering and financing of terrorism,
Giving, offering or taking of bribes,
Financial mismanagement,
Misreporting,
Practices that could put individuals or the environment at risk,
Breach of Post Office internal policies and procedures (including the Code of
Business Standards),
« Concerns about slavery or human trafficking, and
« Any conduct likely to damage Post Office’s reputation

Grievances and matters such as bullying and harassment are addressed under Post Office’s
HR policies and concerns in relation to such matters should be raised in accordance with
the procedures set out in the appropriate HR policy.

If an individual is uncertain about whether something is within the scope of this Policy they
should seek advice from the Whistleblowing Officer, whose contact details are set out in
this Policy.

1.7. Protecting the whistleblower

Post Office has a statutory obligation to protect whistleblowers and will support any
individual who raises genuine concerns under this Policy, even if they turn out to be
mistaken. Post Office are committed to respecting the confidentiality of all
whistleblowers, and including those who wish to remain anonymous.

Post Office will make every effort to protect the whistleblower’s identity, however, it may
be necessary in the course of an investigation to share this information with a relevant
stakeholder (e.g. an investigator). There is no requirement for a whistleblower to provide
personal contact information. However, not providing this information may reduce Post
Office’s ability to undertake a thorough investigation into the concerns raised.

2 In this Policy “individuals” means Postmasters, Agent Assistants, members of the public and employees (permanent staff,
temporary including agency staff, contractors, consultants and anyone else working for or on behalf of Post Office). The
statutory protections offered under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 only apply to employees, however Post Office
Limited will consider extending these protections to other individuals where they have acted in good faith in raising concerns.

Internal Page 4 of 15 Whistleblowing Policy v.1.5
POL00030969

POL00030969

Post Office will take all reasonable steps to ensure that whistleblowers do not suffer any
detrimental treatment as a result of raising a concern. Detrimental treatment includes
disciplinary action, dismissal, threats or other unfavourable treatment connected with
raising a concern. Serious action will be taken against any individual who threatens or
retaliates against whistleblowers in any way.

If an individual believes that they have suffered any such treatment, they should inform
the Whistleblowing Officer immediately. The Whistleblowing Officer should take steps to
address any victimisation, which may include working with the HR team to put
appropriate measures in place. If the matter is not addressed the whistleblower should
raise it formally using Post Office’s Grievance procedure.

In all cases the individual’s concerns will be treated sensitively and in confidence.

1.8. Whistleblowing Officer and ‘Speak Up’

Post Office has a appointed th
be contacted on whistleblowin

as the Whistleblowing Officer who can

The Whistleblowing Officer will review concerns raised and determine the best course of
action, if any. They may ask for further information in order to make this decision.

It is recognised that sometimes raising a concern directly with the business may not be
possible. In such instances individuals should contact the “Speak Up” line, a confidential
reporting service which is run by an independent company InTouch MCS Ltd.

Contact.details.for.the,Speak Up line are:
GRO:

fitouchfeedback.com/postoffice which is a secure on-line web portal:

All reports to the Speak Up line will be acknowledged within five working days and will
be passed to the Whistleblowing Officer.

It is also possible that individuals may whistleblow via a complaint to a front line team,
e.g. Customer complaints, NBSC and Grapevine. These may be verbal or written
communications.

In all instances any whistleblowing reports, regardless of reporting method, will be
passed onto the Whistleblowing Officer. The whistleblower may be kept informed of any
action taken, however, this information may be limited if it is required to keep the
confidence of other people.

1.9. External Disclosures

The aim of this Policy is to provide an internal mechanism for reporting, investigating
and remedying any wrongdoing in the workplace. In most cases individuals should not
find it necessary to alert anyone externally.

However, the law recognises that in some circumstances it may be appropriate for
individuals to report their concerns to an external body such as a regulator. The
independent Whistleblowing charity, Public Concern at Work have a list of prescribed
regulators for reporting certain types of concerns. Their contact details are as follows:

sought out from Public Concern at Work before reporting any concern to an external
party.

2. Risk Appetite and Minimum Control
Standards

2.1. Risk Appetite

Risk Appetite is the extent to which the Group will accept that a risk might happen in
pursuit of day to day businesses transactions. It therefore defines the boundaries of
activity and levels of exposure that the Group are willing and able to tolerate.

The Group takes its legal and regulatory responsibilities seriously and consequently has‘:

e Tolerant risk appetite for Legal and Regulatory risk in those limited circumstances
where there are significant conflicting imperatives between conformance and
commercial practicality

e Averse risk appetite for litigation in relation to high profile cases/issues

¢ verse risk appetite for ligation in relation to Financial Services matters

e Averse risk appetite for not complying with law and regulations or deviation from
business’ conduct standards for financial crime to occur within any part of the
organisation

« Averse Risk Appetite in relation to unethical behaviour by our staff.

The Group acknowledges however that in certain scenarios even after extensive controls
have been implemented an action may still sit outside the agreed Risk Appetite.

2.2. Policy Framework

Post Office has established a suite of policies and procedures, on a risk sensitive approach
which are subject to an annual review. The policy suite is designed to comply with
applicable legislation and regulation. The Whistleblowing Policy should be considered and
read in conjunction with other policies where relevant. These may include the Financial
Crime Policy, the Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy, Health & Safety Policies and HR Policies
where relevant.

2.3. Who Must Comply?

All third parties who. do business with the Group, including consultants, suppliers and
business and franchise partners, will be required to agree contractually to this policy or
have their own equivalent policy.

Any investigations will be carried out in accordance with the Investigations Policy which is
available on the Post Office Intranet

“The Risk appetite was agreed by the Groups Board January 2015

Internal Page 7 of 15 Whistleblowing Policy v.1.5
2.4. Minimum Control Standards

POLO0030969
POL00030969

A minimum control standard is an activity which must be in place in order to manage the risks so they remain within the defined Risk
Appetite statements. There must be mechanisms in place within each business unit to demonstrate compliance. The minimum control
standards can cover a range of control types, i.e. directive, detective, corrective and preventive which are required to ensure risks are
managed to an acceptable level and within the defined Risk Appetite.

The table below sets out the relationships between identified risk and the required minimum control standards in consideration of the stated
risk appetite. The subsequent pages define the terms used in greater detail:
