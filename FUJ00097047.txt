ARQ Report.xls
OK, I will not communicate with POL.
I do have questions and more information for your review; please see attachment.

My assumption is that any records which have been duplicated and presented to Court will need to be replaced. The 2 forthcoming,
high profile cases, West Byfleet and Porters Avenue, immediately spring to mind.

We have only been presenting duplicate records since the beginning of the year and, although not an impossibility, it is unlikely that
we would have provided records for any cases heard in such a short timeframe. I can find no record of any witness statement
provided, apart from those listed on the attachment. However, we need confirmation of this from POL; and guidance from legal.

All of the returns listed may not end up in Court, but we need to be aware that a significant amount may need replacing.

Guy/Penny,

Please do not make any communication on this issue with POL for the moment. We've been looking at this today and are waiting
to determine if a proposed workaround is adequate. I'll come back to you either tomorrow or Monday on progress.

Regards,

Geoff

Gareth/Penny,

I think we need Alan D’Alvarez or Geoff Butts to look at this — I’d hate to have POL raise this as an issue with a HNG-X Acceptance
Board on Tuesday.

Penny,

No, that pretty well covers it. NB there is no guarantee that the duplicates are even complete sessions in which case the sum of all
transaction may even be out.

In summary, any detailed analysis of the finances of a Branch which is done with duplicate transactions without realising that there
are duplicates (and so removing them) will give incorrect results.

These are original records which have been duplicated when copying to Audit Server. We are not suggesting that original
records have been duplicated.

If analysis was undertaken on the audit data some transactions would be duplicated; both plus and minus (we hope!).
Analysis on stock units could be out as TI would show duplicated transfers and equally would TO. Cash on hand analysis
would also be out.

Gareth — is there anything else I need to add?

Would the additional transactions make any difference to the charges for a Sub-Postmaster?

An update to my note sent yesterday.

More detailed analysis shows:-

Number of ARQs affected 112
Number of ARQs where 1 or 2 instances highlighted 17
which indicates bona fide activity

Number of ARQs WIP 7
12 ARQs where court action is known; number of cases 2
8 ARQs returned where witness statement requested 3

but not yet provided; number of cases

ARQs where no court activity is known 76

Audit Development are currently working on a fix which is expected to be available Tuesday 29 June.
Gareth has suggested the following explanation for POL:-

With Horizon counters, the mechanism by which Data is audited has always worked on the principle that it is
acceptable to audit the same data more than once — in particular if in doubt as to whether or not it has been
previously audited successfully.

The Mechanism used on Horizon to retrieve the data took this into account and only presented one instance of such
duplicate data in the ARQ extracts.

However it has recently been noticed that the HNG-X retrieval mechanism does not remove such duplicates and a

quick scan of the ARQs provided to Post Office Ltd since the change to the new system indicates that abut 35% of
the ARQs might contain some duplicate data. A Peak has been raised to remove such duplicate data in the future.
However until the fix is developed, tested and deployed, there is a possibility that data is duplicated.

The reliable way to identify a duplicate transaction is to use the <Num> attribute that is used to generate the unique
sequence numbers. Unfortunately, this attribute is not currently included in the Excel version of ARQ data that has
been passed to Post Office Ltd in the past. This will be included in all future ARQs until the problem is fixed.

Meanwhile all that can be done on existing ARQs is look for transactions that appear to be duplicates. Note that we
have identified a scenario with Postal Services transactions where multiple, identical mails items are accepted (ie
the Quantity button is set to greater than 1), but Postage Labels are printed for each individual item. This results in
separate transactions being generated for each item, which are identical in the ARQ extracts (there is another minor
difference in the raw data apart from the <Num> attribute, but this different attribute is not currently included in the
ARQ extract).
