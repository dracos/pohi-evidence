Post Office Limited (Company No. 02154540) of Finsbury Dials, 20 Finsbury Street, London,

BACKGROUND

(E)

(F)

A group litigation action has been brought by a number of former and current postmasters and
others (the Claimants) against Post Office under Claim Number HQ16X01238 (the Claim). As
part of the Claim, the Claimants wish to approach and seek information from Second Sight. The
Claim is the subject of a Group Litigation Order dated 22"4 March 2017 (the GLO).

Post Office engaged Second Sight in June 2012 to investigate Horizon and the issues being
raised by a number of Postmasters. Second Sight's work involved (1) an original inquiry
investigating Horizon from a general perspective, which work concluded in July 20143; and (2)
investigating the circumstances of individual complaints through the “Complaint Review and
Mediation Scheme”, which work concluded in July 2015.

Second Sight’s engagement was recorded in a letter dated 1 July 2014 (the First Engagement
Letter) which required Second Sight to maintain confidentiality (clause 6) and not to publicly
discuss its work (clause 8) (the Confidentiality Obligations). The subsequent engagement
letter dated 15 April 2015 (the Second Engagement Letter, together with the First Engagement
Letter, the Engagement Letters) restated the Confidentiality Obligations.

In addition, non-disclosure agreements were entered into between Post Office and key personnel
at Second Sight, including the NDAs between lan Henderson dated 31 May 2012 and Ron
Warmington dated 1 June 2012 (the NDAs). Second Sight also undertook and agreed in
October 2012 that certain material was provided to them without waiver of privilege (the
Privilege Undertaking).

Post Office and Second Sight obtained material from Postmasters that is or may be the subject of
confidentiality obligations owed to those persons and/or covered by data protection law. None of
the parties observing this Protocol thereby makes any admission or concession as to the scope
or enforceability of such obligations arising thereunder or under the First Engagement Letter.

The purpose of this protocol is to maintain any such confidentiality or privilege in the material held
by Second Sight, save as expressly otherwise provided in this Protocol. This protocol governs
the agreed basis on which Post Office agrees that Freeths can access Second Sight and sets out
the basis on which Second Sight is released from the Confidentiality Obligations, obligations
under the NDA, and Privilege Undertakings so as to enable them to do so.

3.1.4 The parties agree to co-operate in identifying and agreeing further relevant topics for
discussions to be permitted under this protocol.

3.1.5 Notwithstanding any other paragraph in this protocol, Freeths and Second Sight shall
not discuss the following categories of Information unless Bond Dickinson's prior
written consent is obtained:

(a) Information concerning any actual or contemplated criminal prosecutions
conducted by either Post Office, Royal Mail, the Procurator Fiscal or Public
Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland and any Information relating to the
security investigations, internal decisions of Post Office or other steps taken by
Post Office in relation to these prosecutions;

(b) Information concerning any actual or contemplated civil proceedings and any
Information relating to the investigations, internal decisions of Post Office or other
steps taken by Post Office in relation to these proceedings;

(c) Information which relates to postmasters who are not Claimants;
or
(d) any Information which is (and/or Second Sight believes may be) privileged.

3.1.6 In the event that it is unclear to Freeths whether Information would fall within the above
categories, Bond Dickinson's clarification should be sought prior to the Information
being discussed. Post Office will ensure that Bond Dickinson provide reasonable
cooperation in relation to providing such clarification.

For the avoidance of doubt, Second Sight is also released, to the extent necessary and only for
the purposes of this protocol, from their obligations in the First Engagement Letter that they
would not act for former or current subpostmasters against Post Office.

USE OF INFORMATION

The Information provided by Second Sight to Freeths shall be kept confidential and shall not be
used otherwise than for the purpose of the Claim and the Claimants and Freeths shall treat the
Information as if it had been derived from documents disclosed pursuant to standard disclosure
(that is to say, subject to the restrictions in CPR 31.22).

This clause 4 shall also apply to any Documents provided by Second Sight to Freeths in breach
of this protocol.

PRIVILEGED MATERIALS

If Second Sight or Freeths become aware that privileged Documents or Information have been
handled in a way not in compliance with this protocol, Bond Dickinson should be informed
immediately.

If, contrary to and in breach of its obligations hereunder, Second Sight provides or supplies
Documents and/or privileged Documents or Information to Freeths:

5.2.1 this shall not amount to a waiver of the privilege which subsists in any Documents or
Information in which privilege shall apply; and

5.2.2 Post Office reserves its position to prevent privileged Documents or Information being
relied upon or adduced as evidence in Court.
