Simon,

No issues on service to raise. The peak service is running well and we have had no significant outages of late. Earlier
this year (March through April), we did go through some issues with our service availability. We worked with Post Office
on a joint 'risk and resilience’ review and also contributed to an independent review undertaken by KPMG. The findings
were not problematic to us, we implemented some improvements but no ‘gotcha's', more refinements.

One other key thing to note is that we are supporting Post Office with their ‘forensic’ audit through a company called
second sight. This is all related to allegations of systems issues relating to the old horizon system and fraud prosecutions.
It is important to note that no issues have been identified and previous allegations have been tested in court and not
substantiated.

Regards,

James Davidson

Simon - we have several key issues on the agenda at the moment, let me get a quick summary for you and maybe some
“asks" of Paula.

Gavin/Danny/Mark - can you leverage maybe the Friday update note to brief Simon?
Thanks
