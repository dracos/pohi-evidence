Law enforcement and Security Industry engagement. Senior Authorising Officer for

RECRUITMENT OF SPMS

10.In respect of the October 2008 Feasibility Report “RS1707 Agency Recruitment
Policy” (POL00005670), previous to this policy | was requested by the Head of
Security (John Scott / “JS”), to undertake a project to review security investigation
casework files to identify any mitigating factors in better identifying fraud. One of
the main findings and as noted in the report was that SPMs with 0-5 years' service
were more likely to commit fraud and secondly the POL recruitment process for
spmrs was not robustly managed. Enhanced credit checks and better management
of the recruitment process would help identify and mitigate fraud losses. | can
confirm that | left POL in July 2015 and enhanced processes had not been

introduced.

11.In respect of point 8/page 35 of POL00084977 | can confirm and as noted in
paragraph 10 above the previous review of casework identified a lack of robust
management of new SPMs. Enhanced credit checks would have identified risks at
an earlier stage. POL was unable to undertake these checks independently, with
the aim being to conduct checks in conjunction with a third-party supplier
(Callcredit) and the bank of Ireland. On leaving the business in July 2015 enhanced

processes had not been introduced.

THE ROLE OF THE SECURITY TEAM AND THE POLICIES/PRACTICES IN PLACE

12.|n respect of the period of time | worked in the security team, to the best of my
knowledge POL/Royal Mail had Direct Public Authority (DPA) status to enable them
to undertake criminal investigations. | had no direct involvement in the writing of

these policies, nor the practise or rationale of undertaking private prosecutions.

13.On leaving the business in July 2015 to the best of my knowledge POL were still
undertaking financial recovery where authorised, although this had been greatly

reduced due to the Horizon Integrity issues identified.
Policies governing the conduct of criminal investigations

14.In respect of Policies governing the conduct of criminal investigations by the
Security team and organisational structure | have no knowledge of the policies
mentioned’, other than Post Office Ltd Financial Investigation Policy (version 2,
February 2011) (POL00104853) and Post Office Ltd Anti-Fraud Policy (February
2011) (POL00104855). The aim was to reinforce the security team structure and
aims to the wider business and the fraud prevention approach adopted. This was

driven and directed by the Head of Security, JS.

15.In respect of the structure, security team had “Strands”, all reporting to the Head
of Security. These were; (i) Commercial-leading on POL products and services
such as credit card/banking etc. (ii) The Information Technology Team (IT), leading
on IT within the business(iii) The Operational team, leading on internal fraud,
external crime (robbery, burglary)(iv) The Physical team, leading on areas

including, alarms, buildings, vehicles (v) The Crime Risk/Admin team (re-named

1 POL00030578, POL00104812, POL00104806, POL00031004, POL00031003, POL00030580,

Grapevine; date unknown), leading on risk analysis and administration matters for
the security team. | am not aware of any major changes to these teams during my

time in the security team. For the record | was never the Head of Security.

16.In respect of conducting criminal investigations (and the Inquiry’s question as to
who would determine how an investigation would be conducted), the policies and
procedures gave direction to this. The Head of Security had overall responsibility

for this.

17.1 have been asked about the role of the financial investigation unit. The aim was to
recover financial losses in line with the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. There were
financial levels adopted, from memory | believe a £15k threshold was the level set

for intervention, however | cannot confirm if this is still the case.

18.In respect of other teams within the Post Office being involved in criminal
investigations and prosecutions, the legal team gave overall direction and authority
to proceed in prosecutions. The Network and audit teams liaised with the security
team on investigations, providing supporting evidence and witness statements
where required and where prosecutions were not deemed appropriate, any
outcomes such as contractual matters would be passed to the Network teams as

they had the lead responsibilities for this.

19.In respect of legislation, policies, guidance and / or principles governing the
conduct of investigations conducted by the Security team during the period |
worked within it were directed by legislation, including the Police and Criminal
Investigation Act 2002(PACE), Regulation and Investigation Powers Act 2000
(RIPA), Criminal Procedures and Investigation Act 1996 and the Human Rights Act

1996 (HRA). Any changes would be directed by legislation. In respect of fraud there

Page 5 of 24
WITNO8160100
WITN08160100

was a change of direction when the Head of Security (JS), came which still adhered
to the legislation but adopted a fraud risk approach, aimed at prevention and

detection of crime against POL.

20.In respect of dealing with complaints regarding an investigation, the initial point of
contact would be to the line manager, thereafter, raised to the wider business

helpline.

21.In respect of supervision the investigation manager reported to his/her line
manager who had oversight of the individual cases, which were reviewed on an
ongoing/monthly basis. Overarching this was a monthly review undertaken by the

senior security fraud team and Head of Security of investigation casefiles.

22.In respect of POLs approach to suspected fraud, losses were identified via planned
audits undertaken by the Network teams. Depending on the type or amount of loss,
this would be dealt with either by the Network team as a contractual matter or by
the security team as a criminal investigation. The security team would also conduct

analysis under fraud risk programmes to identify potential fraud and/or losses.

23.In respect of POLs policy and practice regarding investigation and prosecution of
Crown Office employees differing from the policy and practice regarding
investigation and prosecution of SPMs, from a security perspective there was no
difference in dealing with as a criminal investigation, which to the best of my

knowledge did not change during my time.

24.In respect of POL00104900 | am not aware that this had any impact on either
business as they operated and were directed by legislation processes as noted in

framework documents.

Page 6 of 24
WITNO8160100
WITN08160100

25.In respect of the rationale behind the development of a Post Office specific
“Conduct of Criminal Investigations Policy” in 2013 | did not undertake this and

have no recollection of any contribution to this policy.

26.In respect of the draft “Post Office Fraud and Loss Prevention Policy” from 2013 at

POL00038603 | am not aware if this was finalised or approved.

27.In respect of the document entitled “Security Team Objectives 2013 — 2014” dated
April 2013 at POL00105025 my understanding is that the loss reduction board was
the business wide committee to oversee all activities undertaken by the whole
business and the loss reduction programmes were individual activities undertaken
by specific teams to support this. From a security team perspective, the fraud risk
programmes would have fed into this to enable activities and financial benefits to

be tracked.

How and when the Security team became involved in an investigation

28.In respect of the circumstances in which an auditor would be sent to conduct an
audit at a Post Office branch to the best of my understanding there would be two
specific circumstances. Firstly, the Network Audit teams conducted planned yearly
audits at branches. Secondly, if the security or associated
Conformance/Compliance/Cash management teams identified branches that were

deemed a risk due to analysis, then an audit would be requested.

29.In respect of the document “Condensed Guide for Audit Attendance” (version 2,
October 2008) (POL00084813) to the best of my understanding an investigator
would attend an audit of a branch or after an audit has been conducted if there was
a loss identified. | have no recollection on the specific amounts of loss. If in

attendance the investigator's role would be to ensure all evidence is secured in

Page 7 of 24
WITNO8160100
WITN08160100

accordance with PACE and where required arrange and/or conduct interviews

under PACE.

30.In respect of a shortfall being identified during an audit of a branch, the level of loss
would dictate who the auditor reported that shortfall or discrepancy to. | believe the
auditor would report it to the Helpline within the Network. Losses would also be

reported to the Security Administration team.

3

.In respect to the documents POL00104929 and POL00105226 and Appendix 1 to
POL00104825 where a shortfall was identified following an audit of a SPM’s
branch: i) The amount or type of loss would determine whether an investigation
into potential criminality was to be conducted by the Security team or the case was
taken forwards as a debt recovery matter by the Financial Services Centre and /
or the relevant legal team. This would be agreed between the Network and security
team. | am not aware that this process changed during the period | worked within
the Security team. ii) The SPM’s local contract manager would have input into this
decision-making process in conjunction with his/her line manager and/or the
security team. | am not aware that this changed during the period | worked within
the Security team iii) Given the timescales since | left POL, | cannot recollect the
triggers / criteria for raising a fraud case following the identification of a shortfall /
discrepancy in a SPM’s branch. To the best of my knowledge the triggers / criteria

for raising a theft or false accounting case were not different and did not change.

32.In respect of the memo dated 15 December 2009 sent by myself and Dave Posnett
to the Security team (POL00104825), given the timescale (2009 to current), to the
best of my knowledge, the rationale for conducting cash verification exercises in

all branches “(except Crowns)” ahead of the migration to Horizon online was that

Page 8 of 24
WITNO8160100
WITN08160100

in terms of historical fraud loss data, branches would have been deemed a higher
risk than Crown managed branches. | have no knowledge of the impact of this
requirement and the migration to Horizon online more broadly on the work of the
Fraud team. In respect of Appendix 2 within POLO0104825 regarding the three
levels of officer status for members of the Security team due to the timescale (2009
to present) | have no recollection on the decision-making process and impacts on
the fraud team, other than level 1 managers had greater experience in investigation

matters.
Involvement of the Security team in the suspension process

33.In respect of the suspension process, the documents at POL00104809 and
POL00105231 refer to Royal Mail not POL. To the best of my knowledge if a
shortfall was discovered by an audit then the security team would discuss with the
line manager or the contracts manager who if deemed appropriate would
undertake the suspension. The process would not differ between branches or

Crown staff.

The process followed by Security team investigators when conducting a criminal

investigation following the identification of a shortfall

34.In respect of conducting criminal investigations following a shortfall, from my
understanding the document POL00105223 was written to support investigators in
the full process in gathering evidence to support the investigating officer in a
specific POL case. Previous to this the Royal Mail documents were written to cover
both Royal Mail and POL investigations, but did not detail the specific elements

covered by POL. All Royal Mail and POL cases did not differ in reference to

Page 9 of 24
WITNO8160100
WITN08160100

adhering to the legislative framework set out in the documents noted at footnote 1

of this statement.
Decisions about prosecution and criminal enforcement proceedings

35.1 have considered a number of policies identified by the Inquiry’. In respect of the
policies referred to | have no recollection of involvement in the development of the
policies. All Royal Mail documents would have been written by Royal Mail
employees. The POL documents would have been updated to reflect POL following
the separation of the two businesses. The POL prosecution policy was written to
protect the business and its employees and agents from criminal activity and set
out the legislative framework to follow in conducting any investigations. | am not
aware of any specific changes to this during my service in the security team.
Decisions on whether to raise a case would be taken between the relevant parties
involved (such as contracts or line managers), with any decisions on prosecution
and/or confiscation proceedings decided by the Criminal Law team in conjunction

with external lawyers (Cartwright King).
Training, instructions and guidance to investigators within the Security team

36.In respect of training, all investigators undertook in-house training carried out by
previously trained security managers. This involved all aspects of legislature
appropriate to investigations, sections of PACE appropriate to interviewing and
searches. Training was also undertaken in conjunction with Police Law
enforcement (such as searches). Following training all investigators were subject

to an exam with a pass rate set. | am unable to recollect the specific pass rate.

POL00030811.

Page 10 of 24
WITNO8160100
WITN08160100

Following this all investigators were supported by experienced investigators on an

ongoing basis.

37.1 have considered a number of documents identified by the Inquiry®. In respect of
the documents referred to in this section to the best of my knowledge the
documents would have been referred to as part of the training modules for
investigators which in summary would have included the specifics of how to
undertake tape recorded interviews, how to take and manage witness statements,
guidelines to follow during an investigation, how to conduct an interview with key
points to cover for a criminal investigation in relation to the theft act, how to fully
manage a case file investigation, correct procedures to follow in gaining evidence,
including evidence from third parties such as Fujitsu data and an understanding of
disclosure, dealing with defence solicitors, complaints, report writing and the
decision making process for criminal investigations. From a personal perspective |
was trained over 20 years ago and | have no further detailed knowledge of this

area.
Analysing Horizon data and requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu

38.1 have been asked to consider POL00105223 and POL00105213. In respect to
analysing Horizon data this was not within my specific remit and was undertaken
by other members of the security team. | have no detailed knowledge on this and

am unable to assist with this or the date of the document POL00105213.

39.1 have been asked to consider POL00004708 (which concerns Barkham PO). In
respect to the SPM in question, the matter was dealt with by other members of the
security team and as such | have no recollection or knowledge regarding this

particular case.
Cases against SPMS

40.1 have been provided with a list of cases‘. In respect of the cases noted regarding
criminal cases | did not have any direct dealing with any of these cases and cannot
recollect anything. | am not aware that | had any role as an investigator in
prosecutions relating to the public inquiry. Looking back at the time | had no

concerns with criminal cases of which | was involved.
Challenges to the integrity of Horizon

41.In respect of challenges to the integrity of Horizon that came to light this was not

within my remit and was dealt with by the Information Security team.
Involvement in work/reviews relating to Fraud and in-branch losses

42.\In respect of the Fraud Forum, this was set up to ensure that all appropriate internal
stakeholders were ‘joined-up’ with the approach to fraud risks within the business,
with the aims being on prevention and detection of risks within the POL portfolio of
products and services. This included Security, Product and Branch Accounting
(P&BA), Cash Management and Network teams. Previous to this there was more
of an individual team approach. From a security perspective analysis was

undertaken by the team in conjunction with other forum teams on identified risk

areas (such as cash losses, accounting/product irregularities). Planned
programme activities were then undertaken, including audits, conformance visits,
investigations where required, with report/result findings reported upwards to
relevant stakeholders within the business for information and further action where

deemed necessary.

43.In respect of the involvement in reducing cash losses and fraud reduction my
involvement centred around fraud risk programmes (such as cash losses
POL00085769). Having identified the respective risks to the business activities
were agreed with various stakeholders as set out in paragraph 42 above. In
relation to the report undertaken reference POL00042081, my only input to this
was to provide information on current activities undertaken by the security team,
primarily from a fraud perspective. | am not aware if any of the recommendations
were progressed following this report. POLO0105041 referred to actions from a
security Operations lead team meeting of which | was a member. Activities such as
fraud risk programmes were noted in this document for onward activity as noted in

paragraph 42 above.
The Security team’s role in relation to debt recovery

44.In respect of documents POL00084977, POL00084996, POLO00085008 and
POL00085009 both my role and the Security team’s role in relation to recovery of
debt from current and former SPMs was to deploy the fraud risk programmes to
identify, prevent, investigate and where required recover assets though criminal
prosecutions and financial recovery. My recollection of the 2009 review into agent
debt was that the current security fraud risk and investigation activities fed into the

wider business activities on sub postmaster debt to identify future and enhanced

Page 13 of 24
WITNO8160100
WITN08160100

processes to better manage this. | provided information to this from the security
team, with the report and overall ownership being led by the Network Back Office
Efficiency Programme. The fraud risk programmes and investigations continued as

part of this wider review

45.In respect of the document POL00038367 relating to Fraud Investigation and
prevention, my recollection was that the business was greatly reducing headcount
(including members of the security team), and was looking to explore additional
means of debt recovery other than criminal investigations/prosecutions. Whilst
notwithstanding the need to continue with investigations as set out in the
document, it was suggested that other areas of recovery could be explored,

including contractual and civil actions.

46.In respect of the document POL00091483 my recollection is that the branch
support programme was looking at business wide cost reductions and as a
stakeholder the security team played a role in this. As | left the business in July
2015, other than the ongoing fraud risk activities, investigations and the enhanced
credit check vetting project | do not believe | had further involvement and cannot

provide further information on this matter.

Knowledge of bugs, errors and defects in the Horizon system

47. In respect of POL00095547 | was made aware of issues raised regarding Horizon
Integrity, although | had no direct involvement in dealing with these matters from
an operational/IT perspective. This was being led by other teams within the
business. With regards to the Security team, updates were provided via the Head
of Security (JS), in summary these being that the Horizon Integrity issues were

being reviewed. From an investigation perspective we were instructed by JS that

Page 14 of 24
WITNO8160100
WITN08160100

any investigation case files that were subject to Horizon integrity challenges be
passed to the Criminal Law Team/Cartwright King for review and decision on
progression. JS also requested that All case files were passed to himself for

personal review. | cannot recollect specific cases in relation to this.

48.In respect of section 6 of the “Post Office Ltd - Security Policy: Accounting losses
policy for agency branches” (version 1, February 2003) at POLO0086845) and the
same section in the “Post Office Ltd - Security Policy: Liability for losses policy (for
agency branches)” (version 1.7, September 2003) (POL00088867), the suggestion
that system faults with Horizon were “very rare” corresponded with my

understanding of the position in 2003.
Post Office Investigations

49.1 have been asked about my involvement in any investigations carried out by the
POL into the integrity of Horizon and / or the investigation, advice or reports into
the Horizon IT system or its impact on prosecutions that were carried out by the

following (my answer follows each category):
a. Second Sight; No involvement.
b. Cartwright King; Communication to transfer files for comment/authorisation.
c. Simon Clark (of Cartwright King); No involvement.
d. Brian Altman KC; No involvement.
e. Jonathan Swift KC; No involvement

f. The Bates & Others Group Litigation. No involvement.

attention of the Chair of the Inquiry.
