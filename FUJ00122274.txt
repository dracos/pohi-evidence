I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account, formally ICL Pathway Ltd.,
since the 11" March 2002 as an IT Security Analyst where I am involved in IT Security for the
Post Office Account I am authorised by Fujitsu Services to undertake extractions of audit data
held on the Horizon system and to obtain information regarding system transaction information

processed on the Horizon system.

I have been asked to provide details and information on the reports of monitor faults, polling
failures, equipment failures and calls for advice and guidance logged by the Horizon System
Helpdesk recorded during the period 1st February 2005 to the 22nd February 2006 for the

2005 to the 22nd February 2006 there were 28 calls from Boburn Post Office - FAD Code

would have had an effect on the integrity of the information held on the system.

confirmed stability of the system. I should add that this area is not my particular area of
expertise. I have a general knowledge of these procedures and have made the comments
above to aid the court.
