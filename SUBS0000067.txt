PART 1. Introduction

1, These Closing Submissions are made on behalf of Fujitsu Services Limited (“Fujitsu”).

2. Fujitsu has reflected carefully upon the evidence in this Inquiry. In Phase 1, the Inquiry heard
clear, detailed, and profoundly affecting evidence of the human impact of hostile investigations
and wrongful civil and criminal proceedings commenced by Post Office Limited (“Post Office”)
against sub-postmasters and their employees (“SPMs”). Phases 2-7 of the Inquiry have exposed

in detail the failings which brought about these appalling miscarriages of justice.

3e Fujitsu fully acknowledges and accepts its share of those failings, which are outlined in more
detail throughout these Closing Submissions. Fujitsu deeply regrets its role in the suffering of

affected SPMs and their families, and reiterates its sincere apology to them.

4. Fujitsu has remained throughout fully committed to supporting the important work of this
Inquiry, having produced over 240,000 documents to the Inquiry, assisted more than 30 witnesses

in the provision of written and oral evidence, and produced five detailed corporate statements.

5. These Closing Submissions should be read together with the previous written closing
submissions made by Fujitsu in respects of Phases 2, 3 and 4 of the Inquiry. These previous

submissions are not repeated, but are briefly summarised where necessary to provide context.

6. The technical picture is now clear in the evidence before the Inquiry:

6.1. The Horizon IT System was and is an immensely complex system,! interfacing with
numerous different Post Office and third-party systems. The Horizon IT System was, and

remains, but one part of Post Office’s IT infrastructure.

6.2. The design and development of the Horizon IT System posed challenges from inception.
The inapt use of the Private Funding Initiative introduced unnecessary complexities for
design and development. The different contracting parties (i.e. Post Office and the Benefits
Agency) had misaligned, and often poorly articulated, objectives (including in relation to
the enforcement of financial compliance). The Benefits Agency withdrew from the project,
but the decision was taken by the Government shareholder for Post Office to proceed with

the Horizon IT System.

identified seven factors which drove the complexity of the Horizon IT System and its implementation:

SUBS0000067

6.3. Bugs, errors and defects (“BEDs”) are an inherent aspect of any computer system
(particularly one of the scale and complexity of the Horizon IT System). Both Post Office
and Fujitsu were aware from the outset that BEDs were present in the Horizon IT System.
This remains the case, with the risk increasing as the Horizon IT System ages. That said,
the Horizon IT System functions for a significant proportion of the estate on a daily basis

and its performance is subject to Service Level Agreements.

6.4, Certain Fujitsu staff had and continue to have the ability to remotely access the Horizon
IT System from outside the branch, and to make alterations that impact branch accounts.
Remote access was and remains a necessary part of the suite of support tools available to

manage the live operation of the Horizon IT System, including the rectification of BEDs.

6.5. The system remains highly complex and now faces the added challenge of being an ageing
system, dependent upon ‘End-of-Service-Life’ IT infrastructure. In view of the ‘New
Branch IT’ (“NBIT”) project, Post Office has not wanted to invest sufficiently in the
Horizon IT System in recent years. However, Post Office has failed to implement the
proposed replacement for a number of years. Fujitsu is working daily with Post Office to

maintain the Horizon IT System but it has made Post Office well aware of the limitations.

The evidence received by the Inquiry has demonstrated that the issues which have arisen are not
exclusively (or even primarily) IT issues. The miscarriages of justice with which this Inquiry is
concerned were not caused by technological failures alone, butare the product of serious human
and organisational failures in conduct, ethics, governance and culture. Those failures were laid
bare by the evidence heard in this Inquiry, in respect of (i) the investigations and civil and criminal
proceedings against SPMs, and (ii) the inappropriately defensive legal, governance, and public

relations responses to the scandal, which persisted for over a decade.

Executive summary of key themes
This Part 1.1 provides an overview of the key themes which have emerged over the course of

the evidence in the Inquiry.

The Horizon IT System was affected by BEDs, which had the potential to cause, and which
did in fact cause, discrepancies in Post Office branch accounts. As they did for Fraser J in
Bates & ors v Post Office Limited (No 6: Horizon Issues) [2019] EWHC 3408 (QB) (the “Horizon
Issues Judgment’), those technical failings provide a starting point for the Inquiry’s analysis. In
this Inquiry, Fujitsu has consistently acknowledged that BEDs affected the Horizon IT System
throughout its period of operation.” It is not possible, even on the evidence now available, to
identify with precision the total number or nature of BEDs that have affected the Horizon IT
System. However, the evidence does enable the Inquiry safely to conclude that: (i) a number of
BEDs were not immediately identified by technical and human systems designed for that
purpose; (ii) a number of BEDs were not immediately rectified; and (iii) some fixes implemented
for BEDs had the capacity to, and did in fact, generate further issues capable of affecting branch
accounts. The Horizon IT System (as designed) was a particularly complex system and (as with

any system of comparable size) was capable of producing errors.

Throughout the relevant period, Post Office had knowledge of the potential for, and
existence of, BEDs in the Horizon IT System. Post Office was aware from the outset of the
potential for unknown and unresolved BEDs to affect the Horizon IT System, and to impact upon
the integrity of branch accounts.* The sharing of information concerning BEDs was and is a
routine part of the business-as-usual operation of the Horizon IT System and has continued
throughout its period of operation. Post Office was also aware from an early stage of categories
of documents which recorded the existence of BEDs (such as KELs, PinICLs, Peaks and event
logs). The evidence supports the conclusion that the formal and informal systems for information
sharing in relation to BEDs were generally (although, it is accepted, not uniformly) effective in
practice. In particular, the evidence is clear that individuals who held key roles in the conduct of
civil and criminal proceedings against SPMs had knowledge of the potential for, and existence

of, BEDs in the Horizon IT System.

Certain Fujitsu staff had the ability to remotely access the Horizon IT System from outside

the branch, and to make alterations that impacted branch accounts. Remote access was part

Two Closing Submissions on behalf of Fujitsu Services Limited, §17; SUBS0000025, Phase Three Closing
Submissions on behalf of Fujitsu Services Limited, §3; SUBS0000026, Phase Four Closing Submissions on
behalf of Fujitsu Services Limited, §33.

SUBS0000067

of the suite of support tools available to manage the live operation of the Horizon IT System,
including rectification of BEDs. To the extent that evidence is available, it supports the view that
substantive remote access (i.e. where remote access was used to perform actions necessary to
remedy errors in transaction data and branch accounts) was used on only a limited number of
occasions. There is also no evidence to support the view that remote access privileges were used
for any malign purpose, nor any purpose other than to provide necessary technical support to Post
Office branches. In its opening submissions, Fujitsu submitted that the evidence would establish
that Post Office was aware of Fujitsu’s remote access capabilities from an early stage.* That
submission has been borne out in the evidence heard by the Inquiry, which establishes that Post
Office staff (including a number of senior executives) were aware of the ability of certain Fujitsu
staff to remotely access branch accounts, and to make alterations that impacted those accounts.
In particular, the evidence is clear that a number of individuals who held key roles in the conduct
of civil and criminal proceedings against SPMs were aware that the technology made it possible

for employees of Fujitsu to remotely access and amend branch accounts.

12. Training for users of the Horizon IT System was inadequate. In view of the complexity of the
Horizon IT System, it was plainly necessary that SPMs should receive adequate training to enable
their routine use of the system. Training was unlikely ever to be able to replicate all the ways in
which users would be required to interact with the Horizon IT System and could not anticipate
all possible issues. Nonetheless, the evidence does enable the Inquiry safely to conclude that the
training provided to SPMs was inadequate. That is true, both: (i) in the period prior to and during
the national rollout of Legacy Horizon, when ICL Pathway was responsible for training; and (i)
throughout the period of the operation of the Horizon IT System, during which training has been

the responsibility of Post Office.*

13. Both Post Office and Fujitsu helpdesk services for users of the Horizon IT System were
inadequate. The evidence overall supports the conclusion that staff, in both the Post Office- and
Fujitsu-operated support services, for the most part worked to resolve issues raised by SPMs.°
Nonetheless, it is clear that each of the helpdesk services available to users were inadequate to
resolve the problems experienced by SPMs. Some problems appear, on the evidence, to have

been common to both the Post Office and Fujitsu helpdesk services, for example: (i) matters

4 §UBS0000002, Opening Statement on behalf of Fujitsu Services Limited, §24 (“Post Office has been aware
from an early stage of Fujitsu ability to remotely access the Horizon system”).

a On Post Office knowledge of shortcomings in training see: SUBS0000025, Phase Three Closing
Submissions on behalf of Fujitsu Services Limited, §32

From around the end of 2002, the scope of the Fujitsu helpdesk changed in material respects. Whilst the
Fujitsu helpdesk continued to be responsible for resolving hardware, software and network problems, it was
no longer responsible for managing calls from branches relating to advice and guidance, and cash accounting
issues: SUBS0000025, Phase Three Closing Submissions on behalf of Fujitsu Service Limited, §17.

SUBS0000067
SUBS0000067

raised were ‘resolved’ prematurely; and (ii) problems were not always referred appropriately
within the bifurcated (Post Office / Fujitsu) support system, such that technical problems were
not always referred to the appropriate helpdesk for support. The result of the foregoing was that
users of the Horizon IT System were not provided with the standard of support which they

properly required.

The conduct of criminal prosecutions on behalf of Post Office fell considerably short of the
important duties which apply to a private prosecutor. Post Office wrongfully prosecuted
hundreds of SPMs. Indeed, the evidence now available to the Inquiry suggests that the failings in
the conduct of Post Office prosecutions were considerably more fundamental than even those
acknowledged by the Court of Appeal in Hamilton & ors v Post Office Limited [2021] EWCA
Crim 21; [2021] 4 WLR 115 (“Hamilton & ors”). The Inquiry could safely conclude that there
were pervasive failures within Post Office’s investigative, legal and prosecutorial functions
throughout the Inquiry’s relevant period: (i) to advise upon and to pursue all reasonable lines of
inquiry, including those which point away from the guilt of the suspect; (ii) to conduct an
independent, objective, and even-handed assessment of the available evidence — including,
importantly, to conduct an assessment of the reliability of computer data; (iii) to take reasonable
steps to obtain material in the control of third parties (including Fujitsu) which would be
disclosable if in the possession of the prosecutor; (iv) to disclose prosecution material which
reasonably could be considered capable of undermining the case for the prosecution against the
accused, or assisting the case for the accused (including information within Post Office’s own
knowledge as to the existence of BEDs); and (v) to properly instruct expert witnesses on behalf
of the prosecution, and to oversee, interrogate, and make appropriate disclosure as to the
conclusions reached by such experts (see below). The evidence supports the view that those
failures were not isolated to any one individual, but affected Post Office prosecutions in many, if
not all, of the case studies examined by the Inquiry. Moreover, many of those criticisms apply

with equal force to the conduct of Post Office’s external criminal legal advisors.

Rather than acting as a ‘minister for justice’, it is clear that many Post Office staff with
responsibility for the conduct of prosecutions (including investigators and lawyers) acted in a
zealous, aggressive, and partisan manner ~ in particular, in pursuing ‘test cases’ designed to
defend the integrity of the Horizon IT System. A number of those involved in investigations and
prosecutions were inappropriately encouraged with financial incentives tied to debt recovery, and
were in any event overwhelmingly and misguidedly motivated by debt recovery. Post Office’s
conduct of investigations, litigation and prosecutions fell considerably short of required

standards, as well as the standards expected of a publicly funded body.
SUBS0000067
SUBS0000067

16. There were important failings by Post Office in relation to the ‘expert’ witness evidence
relied upon in support of shortfall recovery, civil and criminal proceedings brought against
SPMs. It is clear that there were a number of aspects of Post Office’s engagement of ‘expert’
witnesses (including Gareth Jenkins and Anne Chambers) which were inappropriate, including
that: (i) Post Office never provided Fujitsu staff acting as ‘expert’ witnesses in criminal
proceedings with a formal letter of instruction, setting out the duties of an expert witness; (ii)
Post Office never otherwise informed ‘expert’ witnesses in criminal proceedings of the duties of
an expert witness; (iii) Post Office never ensured that ‘expert’ witnesses in criminal proceedings
had reviewed all data relevant to the potential for apparent ‘shortfalls’ to be caused by BEDs; and
(perhaps most significantly) (iv) on a number of occasions, Post Office employees and external
advisors inappropriately amended ‘expert’ witness statements to remove or dilute references to

the existence of, and potential for, BEDs in the Horizon IT System.

17. Fujitsu failed to recognise the issues and risks associated with its provision of witness
evidence in Post Office led prosecutions. The Codified Agreement between Fujitsu and Post
Office contained novel provisions contractually obliging Fujitsu to provide support to Post Office
in respect of prosecutions. That work was atypical for an IT services provider such as Fujitsu,
and was outside the normal work of Fujitsu technical staff. It is a matter of profound regret to
Fujitsu that it ever provided services to support Post Office proceedings against SPMs. Fujitsu
was never sighted as to the full scale of Post Office’s prosecutorial conduct or misconduct.
Nonetheless, Fujitsu accepts that, (i) it was inappropriately deferential to Post Office as its client,
and (ii) its senior management were insufficiently interventionist in their management and
oversight of the Post Office Account. This led to a failure to properly challenge or scrutinise the
appropriateness of requests made by Post Office and resulted in Fujitsu providing a service (i.e.,
prosecution support) which fell short of its own corporate values. In light of this, Fujitsu
recognises that it failed properly to support those of its employees who engaged directly with
Post Office and its lawyers in respect of prosecution support. This is particularly so for those who
engaged in the provision of documentary and witness evidence in relation to Post Office
prosecutions and civil actions — with technical employees often left to engage directly with Post
Office’s internal and external lawyers, rather than having appropriate mechanisms by which to

monitor and support those employees.

18. There were issues with the Audit Record Query (“ARQ”) data provided by Fujitsu to Post
Office in the context of proceedings against SPMs. In relation to the provision of ARQ data,
Fujitsu has already admitted in previous submissions to the Inquiry’ that: (i) the ARQ data

provided by Fujitsu to Post Office was on its own inadequate to enable Post Office, or any

SUBS0000067

affected SPM, to interrogate (properly, or at all) whether any apparent ‘shortfall’ was, or may
have been, the result of BEDs in the Horizon IT System; and (ii) there were a number of errors,
defects, and inadequacies in the system for the production of ARQ data which cast fundamental
doubt upon the reliability of that data, some of which appear to have beset the system for the
production of ARQ data since its inception. Post Office were aware of the inherent limitations of
ARQ data (indeed, they were the product of contractual agreement between Post Office and
Fujitsu, which Post Office declined to revise or broaden in scope) and that it would not necessarily
capture all potentially relevant data from the Horizon IT System.* Post Office were also aware of

sufficient information to raise substantial doubts as to its reliability.

Post Office’s response to the emerging public scandal was inappropriately defensive.
Moreover, the response to the public scandal tended to frame this as primarily or exclusively an
IT issue — rather than to recognise the serious failures in conduct, ethics, governance, culture, and
systems that have been revealed in evidence before the Inquiry. The tenor of Post Office’s public
response to the emerging scandal is all the more concerning given the widespread knowledge
within Post Office as to the potential for and existence of BEDs and remote access in the Horizon
IT System, throughout its period of operation. That defensive posture in relation to the integrity
of the Horizon IT System and the safety of Post Office led prosecutions affected: (i) Post Office’s
engagement with, and response to, the work of Second Sight; (ii) the conduct of the Working
Group for the Internal Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme; (iii) the response to the claims
advanced in the Bates & ors v Post Office group litigation and the conduct of that litigation; (iv)
the ‘lines’ adopted in response to escalating media criticism regarding the Horizon IT System;
and (v) engagement with Government and Members of Parliament, as they sought to investigate
repeated concerns raised by constituents. The public defence of the Horizon IT System was
demonstrably wrong. Fujitsu regrets that it ever assisted in such a defensive posture being
advanced by Post Office in relation to the Horizon IT System. A concerning feature of the
evidence which emerged in Phases 5 and 6 of the Inquiry was that a number of senior individuals
at Post Office, responsible for developing and advancing the ‘lines’ that the Horizon IT System
was not affected by BEDs or that remote access was not possible, appear to have known (or

ought, on the information readily available to them, to have known) that these ‘lines’ were untrue.

The conduct of the Bates & ors v Post Office Limited group litigation was inappropriately

hostile. Post Office pursued a strategy of “attrition” that would “force” SPM claimants to “burn

See, for example, the issue identified in relation to the Lepton branch in 2013 where Post Office discussed
with Fujitsu the possibility of adding extra fields to ARQ data such that it distinguished between a transaction
that had been reversed automatically as part of the recovery process and a transaction that had been reversed
manually by the SPM in branch. See: POL00134139, Email chain dated 7 February 2013 to 13 February
2013, ‘Lepton logs’, p.2; WITN00460400, Fourth Witness Statement of Gareth Jenkins, dated 29 April 2024,
§§50-51; INQ00001137, Transcript, 26 April 2024, p.41, In.4-p.49, In.9 (Ms Angela van den Bogerd).

money” such that SPM claimants and their litigation funders would “decide that it is too costly
to pursue the litigation and give up”. The conduct and strategy of the group litigation proved
impervious to proper Government oversight. Fujitsu deeply regrets that it lent any support to Post

Office, by the provision of witnesses, in the group litigation.

There were important shortcomings in the mechanisms for oversight of Post Office by
Government. The Government's role as sole shareholder of Post Office was, in theory, intended
to enable oversight, via UK Government Investments (formerly the Shareholder Executive)
(“ShEx”) / the Department of Trade and Industry (“DTI”), to ensure that, as a public asset, the
affairs of Post Office were managed in the public interest. However, the issues considered in this
Inquiry have plainly exposed the shortcomings of those oversight arrangements — including the
serious consequences where officials, far from providing robust and challenging oversight, go
“rogue”. In particular, the evidence enables the Inquiry safely to conclude that: (i) systems proved
inadequate to ensure that information necessary for the effective public oversight of Post Office
reached ShEx / DTI / Ministerial level; (ii) an overly rigid distinction between ‘operational
matters’ and ‘strategic matters’ served to insulate important aspects of Post Office’s operation,
including the conduct of private prosecutions, from necessary oversight by Government; (iii)
even where issues concerning the Horizon IT System and the treatment of SPMs were directly
raised with Members of Parliament or Ministers, the oversight arrangements within ShEx / DTI
/ Ministerial offices remained inadequate for relevant matters to be identified, escalated, and
appropriately mitigated. More concerningly, ShEx / DTI officials accepted (without serious
challenge) Post Office ‘lines’ regarding the integrity of the Horizon IT System and the safety of
Post Office led prosecutions, and fed those lines into Government — seriously undermining the
ability of Government to oversee the affairs of Post Office. Post Office and/or ShEx / DTI
officials frustrated, rather than facilitated, effective oversight of Post Office by Ministers. Those
failures in oversight had important consequences for the way in which the matters at the heart of

this Inquiry developed.

There were significant cultural and governance failings within Post Office. The evidence
before the Inquiry has exposed a hierarchical culture within Post Office, which was innately
hostile to the interests of SPMs, a culture which may well continue to exist in some parts of Post
Office’s business. Further, Post Office fostered a culture which was inappropriately defensive,
and hostile to external oversight and criticism. It is clear that a number of (inaccurate) ‘messages
from the top’ permeated Post Office’s business, including as to the “robustness” of the Horizon
IT System, and (without evidence, or further interrogation) became the unassailable foundation

for Post Office’s response to the emerging scandal.

The position today

It is right that the Inquiry, and indeed the public, should carefully scrutinise the position today in
relation to the operation of the Horizon IT System, and the conduct of Post Office, Fujitsu, and
others. The public rightly expect that lessons have been learned and implemented from the

appalling miscarriages of justice exposed clearly in the evidence before the Inquiry.

Fujitsu has been clear and consistent in its position on ongoing criminal investigations and
prosecutions, namely that: (i) Fujitsu will never again provide witness evidence of any kind in
support of Post Office-led criminal investigations or prosecutions of SPMs; (ii) Fujitsu has
offered, and will continue to offer, full and conscientious cooperation to any police force
conducting an independent investigation into potential criminal wrongdoing in connection with
Post Office branches (including by the provision of factual witness evidence); and (iii) Fujitsu is
determined not to repeat the mistakes of the past. Fujitsu has made that position clear, both
publicly and in private to Post Office and police forces. This applies with equal force to any civil

investigations and enforcement action by Post Office against SPMs.

Real concerns arise as to the manner in which Post Office continues to conduct criminal
investigations, and in Post Office’s interactions with police forces in relation to potential
criminal prosecutions. In particular, correspondence in evidence before the Inquiry raises real
concerns as to whether Post Office’s Assurance & Complex Investigations Team (the “A&CI
Team”) may be repeating some of the serious errors which led to the appalling miscarriages of
justice under investigation by the Inquiry, namely: (i) viewing enforcement action against SPMs
as a deterrent; (ii) adopting a narrow focus on proof of BEDs affecting a particular branch at a
particular time (at the expense of considering wider issues concerning the potential for unknown
BEDs); (iii) inappropriately seeking ‘expert’ evidence from Fujitsu employees who, given their
lack of independence, are in no position properly to provide such evidence; and (iv) perpetuating
overconfident assessments of the “robustness” of the Horizon IT System. Viewed in that context,
attempts by the A&CI Team to circumvent the scrutiny of the Post Office Board in relation to

their engagement with police forces appear all the more problematic.

Fujitsu has worked conscientiously to learn lessons from the work of the Inquiry, and to
implement remediations in its operations and governance designed to prevent a recurrence
of anything akin to the miscarriages of justice at the heart of this Inquiry. Fujitsu also
candidly acknowledges that, while it has not wanted to pre-empt the conclusions of this Inquiry,
more by way of reform and remediation activities could and should have been completed sooner.
Fujitsu is committed to its remediation activities, particularly as regards governance and values,

continuing and developing following the conclusion of this Inquiry.

PART 2. Key themes in relation to Phases 2-4

27. As referred to above, Fujitsu has made detailed closing submissions in respect of Phases 2-4 of
the Inquiry.’ It is not necessary or desirable to repeat the detail of those previous submissions.
Nonetheless, the key themes which arose in Phases 2-4 inevitably inform the proper approach to

the assessment of the evidence in Phases 5-7 of the Inquiry. Therefore:

27.1. This document should be read together with the closing submissions made on behalf of
Fujitsu at the conclusions of Phases 2-4 of the Inquiry. Fujitsu continues to stand by the
submissions made previously, which have been further reinforced by the evidence
subsequently heard by the Inquiry. The Inquiry is invited to take account of the submissions

advanced in Fujitsu’s Phases 2-4 closing submissions in its assessment of later evidence.

27.2. In order to contextualise Fujitsu’s submissions in respect of Phases 5-7 of the Inquiry, this

Part 2 provides a brief summary of the key themes which arose in earlier Phases.

2.1 Post Office knowledge of BEDs

28. Post Office had considerable institutional knowledge of the potential for, and existence of, BEDs
in the Horizon IT System prior to its rollout and throughout its period of operation. That
knowledge plainly existed from at least July 1999,'° and continued to develop throughout the

Inquiry’s relevant period.'' In addition, from an early stage, Post Office, including lawyers acting

on its behalf, were aware of categories of documents which evidenced BEDs (such as KELs,
PinICLs, Peaks and events). In order to assist the Inquiry, Fujitsu has prepared an Annex to these
Closing Submissions, which identifies (chronologically, and by reference to key individuals) the

state of Post Office’s knowledge of BEDs, and categories of documents evidencing BEDs.

It is important to recall that the sharing of information concerning BEDs between Fujitsu and
Post Office was a routine part of the business-as-usual operation of the Horizon IT System, and
continued throughout its period of operation. That includes by way of (i) various reports passing
between ICL Pathway / Fujitsu and Post Office throughout the relevant period in respect of
identified technical issues within the Horizon IT System; (ii) various forums and channels of

communication which existed between Fujitsu and Post Office, in the course of which BEDs and

system integrity issues were routinely discussed; (iil) the close working relationship between
Post Office and ICL Pathway / Fujitsu, which was noted by a number of witnesses before the
Inquiry;'* (iv) joint Fujitsu and Post Office test teams;'* (v) joint working documents that
demonstrate Fujitsu’s and Post Office’s mutual understanding regarding the existence of, and

potential impacts of, BEDs '5 (joint working is also evident in the management of particular BEDs

not be frequent enough to make training on it worthwhile’); WITN04730100, First Witness Statement of
Simon Baker, dated 25 October 2024, §24 (“7 do not recall thinking the Horizon Online-related challenges
were a “big deal” at the time. I was not concerned as it is typical and expect IT issues in new large IT
deployments. For example, it is expected to discover BEDs outside of a testing environment because the real-

about which the Inquiry heard evidence in Phase 3); and (vi) the release management process,
which was an important measure in the management of BEDs.'® Further, there were (and are) a
number of systems in place to identify and rectify BEDs in the Horizon IT System. Those systems
are described in detail in Fujitsu’s Second Corporate Statement, and Fujitsu’s submissions in this
regard are set out in §§17-18 of its Phase 2 Closing Submissions and in §§11-21 of its Phase 3

Closing Submissions.

As a matter of terminology, Fujitsu would urge some caution in adopting the language of
“robustness” to draw general conclusions about the operation of the Horizon IT System. As is
clear from the Horizon Issues Judgment, that was a term adopted in the pleadings in the group
litigation, and which the parties to that litigation nonetheless used imprecisely (§36) and
struggled to define with clarity (§§36-56). Put shortly, although it may be accepted that the term
is one used in software engineering, as a standard or threshold, it lacks clarity and precision (not
least because it can mean different things to different people, or different things in different
contexts). Fraser J adopted the following definition of “robustness” (Horizon Issues Judgment,
§54):!7

“Robustness ... means the ability of any system to withstand or overcome adverse
conditions. A robust system is strong and effective in all or most conditions. The robustness
of a system is the effectiveness of the system in managing the risks of imperfections (which
are inevitable in any system) and their consequences ... Robustness does not mean
perfection.”

Fujitsu also recognises that some witnesses have appeared to offer more general assessments as
to the “robustness” of the Horizon IT System and/or the quality of its source code. While,
undoubtedly, that evidence was given in the spirit of providing assistance to the Inquiry, it does
not provide a sufficient evidence base from which to draw firm conclusions as to the overall
operation (or “robustness”) of the Horizon IT System. Put simply, no witness before the Inquiry
has examined the Horizon IT System code — the minimum that would be required in order to
enable such a conclusion to be drawn. Nonetheless, as above, Fujitsu accepts that the Horizon IT
System was affected by numerous BEDs, which BEDs had the potential to impact, and did in fact

impact, upon branch accounts.

The evidence supports the conclusion that information about the potential for, and existence of,

BEDs in the Horizon IT System was shared with and available to: (i) individuals across a range

See, for example: WITN11200100, First Witness Statement of Alan Barrie, dated 31 October 2024, §112
(“Some [BEDs] were dealt with through software patches (repairs) whilst others would be designed out of
the system as part of major software releases”).

The same could also be said of other general terms, such as “reliability”

of teams within Post Office; (ii) individuals of varying levels of seniority within Post Office (up
to, and including, senior executives within Post Office, and members of the Post Office Board);
(iii) relevant individuals engaged as external advisors to Post Office (including external legal
advisors); (iv) individuals and organisations involved in relevant investigations of Post Office
systems and processes; and (v) individuals involved in the oversight of Post Office by

Government. The evidence in support of these submissions is set out in the Annex.

Remote access

Certain Fujitsu staff had the ability to remotely access the Horizon IT System from a location
other than the branch, i.e. “remote access”. '* It is necessary to distinguish between different types
of remote access capabilities, namely: (i) the use of read-only remote access by support teams for
diagnostic and investigative purposes; (ii) the use of remote access to make technical system

changes, but without any direct impact upon transactions in branch accounts (“housekeeping

remote access”); '° and (iii) the use of remote access to correct a transaction which was the subject
of an error by inserting an additional credit or debit transaction (referred to herein as “substantive
remote access”).”° Of those, it is substantive remote access which is likely to impact the branch
account trading position. Remote access was and remains a necessary part of the suite of support
tools available to manage the live operation of the Horizon IT System, including the rectification

of BEDs. Ms Chambers’ evidence was that remote access was essential to the proper functioning

of the SSC: “we could not have done our job otherwise”.

Fujitsu acknowledges that this definition of “remote access” is broader than that adopted by Fraser J in
AMCL0000013, Bates & ors v Post Office Limited (No.6) “Horizon Issues” [2019] EWHC 3408 (QB),
§534 (“action taken remotely to either inject new transactions or to edit existing transactions or to delete
existing transactions in a way that could change the accounting position of the relevant branch’).

See, for example: (i) INQ00000981, Transcript, 2 May 2023, p.205, In.12-In.14 (Mrs Anne Chambers)
(“making the changes would not necessarily be changes to financial data”). A common situation which
would require housekeeping remote access was where a system variable (for example, a status flag) was in
the wrong position, and required to be changed (for example, ‘Stock Unit Unlock’ and ‘End of Day Marker’);
(ii) POL00028922, Spreadsheet of logged incidents, dated 17 September 2004. This record of Mr Roll’s
work on the SSC records him as dealing with a number of issues described variously as ‘Unlock user’ (row
10, row 11) or ‘User Locked out of SU’ (row 41), which reflect this kind of housekeeping remote access;
Mr Parker gave a further example of housekeeping remote access in Legacy Horizon, where Riposte
records had to be “re-play/edJ” into the correct message store, see WITN00680100, First Witness Statement
of Stephen Parker, dated 27 March 2023, §84 (“these SSC workarounds did not involve the construction or
amendment of transactions. SSC would be re-playing records that had already been committed to a Message
Store but that for some reason, were not in the correct place”).

The evidence before the Inquiry continues to support the conclusion that Post Office staff were
aware of the ability of Fujitsu staff to remotely access branch accounts, and to make alterations

that might impact those accounts. As to that:

34.1. One of the controls upon the use of substantive remote access was the OCR / OCP
procedure,” which involved Fujitsu seeking the approval of Post Office personnel
(usually, if not invariably). A procedure which was in place from at least 2001.73 Plainly,
those personnel were aware (or ought reasonably to have been aware) of the nature of the
technical operations which they were authorising. By way of illustration, former Post
Office employee, Gary Blackburn described the OCP procedure to the Inquiry as the “audit

trail” created in respect of any alteration, by Fujitsu staff, to the branch ‘message store’ .”4

34.2. Inany event, it is clear that Fujitsu’s remote access capabilities were described in a number
of contemporaneous procedural documents available to the Post Office. By way of

example, in around March 2004, a Fujitsu procedural document, ‘Customer Service

Operational Change Procedure’, which described various controls concerning the issue of

remote access, was provided to John Bruce of Post Office.”°

34.3. A number of Post Office staff members admitted having, or were demonstrated in evidence
to have had, contemporaneous knowledge of Fujitsu’s remote access capabilities. Those
individuals included: Paula Vennells,”° Lesley Sewell,”’ Susan Crichton,”* Mark Davies,”

Jarnail Singh,” and Rodric Williams,*' among others.*?

Mismatch bug in around September 2010, the ability of Fujitsu to “manually write an entry
value to the local branch account” was discussed as a potential solution to be applied to
impacted branches.*? In this regard, it was noted that: “This has significant data integrity
concerns and could lead to questions of “tampering” with the branch system and could
generate questions around how the discrepancy was caused. This solution could have
moral implications of Post Office changing branch data without informing the branch”.
These notes were circulated to Rob Wilson, Mr Singh and Juliet McFarlane of Post Office’s

legal team on 8 October 2010.54

35. There is no evidence to support the suggestion*> that remote access privileges were used for any
purpose other than to provide necessary technical support to Post Office branches, i.e. there is no
evidence to support any suggestion of the malign use of remote access capabilities.*° Abuse of
remote access privileges by a malign actor is impossible to positively exclude on the evidence.
However, it is difficult to see how an individual Fujitsu employee (who has no financial stake in
the performance of an individual Post Office branch) could have any incentive to abuse remote

access privileges in that way.

2.3. Post Office prosecutions

36. — Post Office investigations and prosecutions did not begin with the introduction of the Horizon IT
System. Rather, it is clear that Post Office had an established, active investigation and prosecution
function in place prior to the national rollout of the Horizon IT System in 2000. The available
evidence demonstrates a significant increase in investigative and prosecutorial activity during the
period 1992 to 1998. For example, Appendix II to the second witness statement of Simon
Recaldin shows an increase from I shortfall-related conviction in 1992 to 14 in 1998 and 21 in
1999. Post Office’s 24 September 2024 response to a Freedom of Information request dated 13
January 2024 then shows an increase in financial misconduct related investigations from 7 in
1992 to 378 in 1998, and in financial misconduct related prosecutions from fewer than 5 in 1992
to 44 in 1998.37 This initial increase in investigative and prosecutorial activity occurred
following the introduction of an in-house accounting system called Capture in Post Office

branches in 1992 and pre-dates the Horizon IT System.

The conduct of criminal prosecutions on behalf of Post Office fell considerably short of the
important duties which apply to a private prosecutor. Post Office wrongfully prosecuted hundreds
of SPMs. In its Phase 4 Closing Submissions, Fujitsu made detailed submissions as to the range
of serious deficiencies which undermined the integrity of Post Office prosecutions.** That

included:

37.1. A failure to advise upon and to pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry, including those which
point away from the guilt of the suspect. Instead, a number of witnesses admitted to
operating under an assumption that SPMs were necessarily to blame for any apparent

‘shortfall’.*°

37.2. A failure to conduct an independent, objective, and even-handed assessment of the
available evidence — including, importantly, to conduct an assessment of the reliability of

computer data.

37.3. A failure to take reasonable steps to obtain material in the control of third parties (including
Fujitsu) which would be disclosable if in the possession of the prosecutor. In respect of a
number of the case studies examined by the Inquiry in Phase 4: (i) no ARQ data was
obtained by Post Office from Fujitsu;*° and, in many cases (ii) there is no evidence of direct

contact between Post Office and Fujitsu.*!

37.4. A failure to disclose prosecution material which reasonably could be considered capable
of undermining the case for the prosecution against the accused, or assisting the case for
the accused. In particular, Post Office failed to disclose information within its own
knowledge as to the existence of BEDs in the Horizon IT System and in other relevant Post
Office and third-party systems, and as to the capacity of those BEDs to impact upon branch

accounts.

further stated that the position was “not absolutely clear” in relation to the case of Mr Peter Holmes because,
while “a degree of Horizon material” was obtained, the source of that material was unclear, and there was
no evidence of “the results of any such contact [with Fujitsu], or, indeed, any document that set out such
contact’. See: INQ00001109, Transcript, 18 December 2023, p.110, In.8-p.111, In.2 (Mr Duncan Atkinson

37.5. A failure to properly instruct expert witnesses on behalf of the prosecution, and to oversee,
interrogate, and make appropriate disclosure as to the conclusions reached by such experts.

That included a failure to: (i) set out the expert’s instructions in a formal letter of

instruction; (ii) provide to the expert all information relevant to their instructions; and (ii
inform the expert of the scope and nature of their relevant duties to the Court. This failure
was accepted by a number of Post Office witnesses.*? As Mr Atkinson KC summarises the
position in relation to Mr Jenkins: “Communication with him in writing appears to have
been informal and brief, and at no point made any reference to the duties of either Mr
Jenkins as expert or the Post Office as prosecutor in relation to material underlying or
undermining his opinions”. Those failures were not always visible to those supporting

employees purporting to act as ‘expert’ witnesses.

In relation to the instruction of expert witnesses, Fujitsu’s previous submissions“ were entirely
consistent with Mr Jenkins’ subsequent evidence that: (i) he never received a formal letter of

instruction;** (ii) he was never informed of the scope and nature of an expert’s duty to the Court;“

and (iii) he did not, at any stage when he was giving evidence on behalf of Post Office, understand
the nature of an expert’s duty to the Court.‘” Given that Mr Jenkins’ evidence is consistent with
that of Post Office witnesses responsible for the conduct of criminal prosecutions, and with the
contemporaneous documentary evidence (as noted by Mr Atkinson KC, quoted above), the

Inquiry is respectfully invited to accept that evidence. In relation to Mr Jenkins, the failure of

‘you to give evidence?” A. “Correct”). To be clear, the fact that Mr Jenkins appears to have been forwarded
a separate letter of instruction to “Fujitsu Services” (FUJ00152601, Email from Brian Pinder to Gareth
Jenkins dated 5 June 2006, ‘Post Office — subpostmatser [sic] disputes’, p.1; FUJ00152603, Letter from

no case in which Mr Jenkins was instructedas an expert witness in which Post Office explained to Mr Jenkins
the obligations attendant upon the task he was specifically being requested to perform, i.e. acting as an expert
witness.

Post Office and its external legal advisors to give proper and detailed instructions had particularly
serious consequences. Mr Jenkins explained, in his evidence to the Inquiry, that his mindset when
approaching witness evidence in support of Post Office prosecutions was primarily to focus on
what was occurring at a particular branch in a particular period of time; rather than focussing
more generally upon the operation of the Horizon IT System as a whole.** Of course, had it been
intended that Mr Jenkins ought to have provided a more general certification as to the integrity
of the Horizon IT System, that is precisely the sort of matter which could, and should, have been
made clear to him (and to Fujitsu generally) by way of formal instructions. Indeed, it is not clear
that there is in fact any one person at Fujitsu who, either at the relevant time or today, would be
capable of providing a general certification as to the operation of the Horizon IT System as a

whole, exclusively from their own knowledge.”

Fujitsu acknowledges that it failed properly to support those of its staff who engaged directly
with Post Office and its lawyers in respect of Post Office’s civil and criminal proceedings. The
prosecution support which Fujitsu was contractually obliged to provide to Post Office was
atypical among Fujitsu’s other contracts, and was certainly atypical work for its technical staff to
undertake. Given that the Fujitsu staff who appeared as witnesses were generally technical staff
with little (or no) familiarity with the procedures for, and duties associated with, the provision of
witness evidence in court proceedings, Fujitsu recognises that there was a missed opportunity for
Fujitsu to intervene to ensure that witnesses were properly prepared and supported, and

conducted themselves in accordance with their duties.

PART 3. Responses to concerns regarding the Horizon IT System and prosecutions

40. The Inquiry has heard a substantial volume of evidence regarding the various responses made to
growing public concern regarding the integrity of the Horizon IT System, and the prospect of
wrongful prosecutions by Post Office. In this Part 3, Fujitsu makes submissions on three aspects
of the response to those concerns: (i) Post Office’s relationship with Government and Members

the advice of Simon Clarke dated 15 July 2013 (the

of Parliament; (ii) Second Sight; and

“Clarke Advice”). Fujitsu addresses the group litigation separately in Part 4, below.

41. Before turning to the substance of Post Office’s response to increasing public concern regarding
the integrity of the Horizon IT System and the safety of Post Office led prosecutions, it is helpful

to summarise the key submissions made in previous Phases of the Inquiry:

41.1. All those involved in formulating Post Office’s response to the emerging scandal were
aware of BEDs in the Horizon IT System which had the capacity to impact upon branch

accounts.

41.2. All those involved in formulating Post Office’s response to the emerging scandal were also
aware of the ability of Fujitsu staff to remotely access, and to make alterations to, branch

accounts.

41.3. The foregoing is true, in particular, of Ms Vennells,*° Ms Sewell,*' Ms Crichton,*? Mr

Bogerd.*”

It is fair to observe that, right from the publication of the first Computer Weekly article in 2009,
Post Office’s approach was one of institutional defensiveness and denial in respect of concerns
raised about the integrity of the Horizon IT System and the safety of convictions which Post
Office pursued. That was a consistent position throughout the Inquiry’s relevant period. It is
particularly reflected in Post Office’s engagement with Government and Members of Parliament
as they sought to investigate repeated concerns raised by constituents, the approach to the review
conducted by Second Sight, and the public-facing ‘lines’ adopted in response to escalating media

criticism.

Fujitsu recognises that, at times, it also was defensive in respect of the Horizon IT System. Fujitsu
deeply regrets that it ever took this posture, and that it ever acquiesced to, or assisted in, such a

posture being advanced by Post Office.

Post Office’s relationship with Government / Members of Parliament

The evidence in Phases 5, 6 and 7 explored Post Office’s relationship with Government in
considerable detail, including the manner in which senior Post Office representatives briefed
Government officials and Members of Parliament on matters relating to the integrity of the
Horizon IT System and Post Office led prosecutions. Plainly, that evidence raised concerns
regarding the sufficiency and accuracy of information provided to Government officials and

Members of Parliament. On the basis that Fujitsu has no involvement in the relationship or

interactions between Post Office and Government, Fujitsu does not propose to make detailed
submissions on this issue, which will no doubt be the subject of careful consideration by the

Inquiry.

Second Sight

Fujitsu makes four over-arching submissions in relation to the investigations by Second Sight:

45.1. The investigations by Second Sight were a significant opportunity for concerns regarding
the integrity of the Horizon IT System to be exposed. It represented the only independent
investigation of the Horizon IT System during the Inquiry’s relevant period which had
sufficient access to: (i) the sort of detailed technical information required to identify BEDs
in the Horizon IT System; and (ii) information on Post Office led prosecutions, sufficient

to identify the kinds of serious miscarriages of justice at the heart of this Inquiry.

45.2. The Second Sight investigations also significantly went beyond simply looking at the
Horizon IT System and importantly sought to understand in a more holistic way what was
at the root of the concerns raised by SPMs. It looked at Post Office’s business processes
and contracts with SPMs, training, helpdesk, investigations, amongst other matters, all of

which were clearly flagged as potential failings.*

45.3. The evidence suggests that, on the whole, interactions between Second Sight and Fujitsu
were mediated by Post Office.*? Second Sight did, however, have some direct interactions
with Mr Jenkins (one in-person meeting in September 2012 and, thereafter, by email).
Ian Henderson described Mr Jenkins as being “very open” in relation to issues of remote
access.®! Mr Henderson’s view was that Mr Jenkins was a “technical expert”, who “didnt

strike [him] as a company person or feeling that he had to stick to a particular party line,

While significant attention has, rightly, been given to the findings of the 8 July 2013 Interim Report (and
Post Office’s response to them), the later Second Sight reports flagged to Post Office numerous further
failings and concerns. For example, POL00021791, ‘Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme
Briefing Report — Part Two’, dated 9 April 2015, flagged: (i) the unfairness of the contract between SPMs.
and Post Office and the transfer of accounting risk to postmasters (pp.6-7); (ii) problems with ATMs and
their ability to cause shortfalls (p.14); (iii) foreign currency transactions (p.20); (iv) National Lottery (p.21);
(v) delays in the issuance of Post Office Transaction Corrections (p.28); and (vi) the lack of information and
data available to enable SPMs to investigate and resolve discrepancies (pp.28-30). The findings of Second
Sight are consistent with the Detica Report (POL00004408) commissioned by Post Office in 2013, which
was widely disseminated amongst Post Office’s senior managers in October 2013, including Lesley Sewell,
Dave Pardoe, Chris Aujard, Chris Day, Rod Ismay, Hugh Flemington, Angela van den Bogerd and Gayle
Peacock (POL00342987).

in terms of supporting Fujitsu” .©? Mr Henderson specifically denied that Mr Jenkins was
“taking the defensive position that the Post Office was”.® That is consistent with what Mr

Henderson told Ron Warmington of his interactions with Mr Jenkins.

45.4. In relation to Mr Jenkins’ dealings with Post Office in the context of Second Sight’s
investigations, the evidence of Simon Baker, then Head of Programmes and Planning at
Post Office and a key liaison during Second Sight’s work, mirrored that of Second Sight.
Mr Baker described his discussions with Mr Jenkins as “formal, helpful, transparent, and

technical”.

For the avoidance of doubt, there is no merit in the suggestion that Fujitsu withheld information
from Second Sight or minimised the prevalence of BEDs in the Horizon IT System in its
interactions with Second Sight. Any such submission would be contrary to the evidence directly

from Mr Henderson, Mr Warmington and Mr Baker.

The Simon Clarke Advice and post-conviction disclosure
The Inquiry may well consider that a particularly significant vignette in relation to the conduct
of Post Office led prosecutions is the reaction to the Clarke Advice, which concerned the use of

expert evidence relating to the integrity of the Horizon IT System.

Fujitsu is grateful to the Chair for inviting submissions from Core Participants in relation to the
duty of post-conviction disclosure as described in the decision of the Supreme Court in Nunn, R
(on the application of) v Chief Constable of Suffolk Constabulary [2015] AC 225.7 Fujitsu
agrees with the Chair’s provisional view that, since at least 1 January 2000, prosecutors have
been under a duty to disclose any material to a convicted defendant which might cast doubt upon

the safety of the conviction.

The evidence in Phases 5 and 6 of the Inquiry concerning the handling of the Clarke Advice by
Post Office and its external legal advisors was startling. Beyond the obvious issues concerning
evidence provided by Mr Jenkins, the Clarke Advice raised fundamental issues and risks

regarding Post Office’s conduct of prosecutions, and its non-compliance with the duties of a

prosecutor. Those fundamental issues were made known to key members of Post Office’s
Executive. Significantly, Post Office’s receipt of the Clarke Advice closely coincided with the
publication of Second Sight’s Interim Report on 8 July 2013 (“Second Sight Interim Report”),
which raised issues concerning the Horizon IT System, Post Office’s poor treatment of SPMs and
inadequacies in its investigations function. The Inquiry may well conclude that the handling of
the Clarke Advice by Post Office executives was a pivotal moment in Post Office’s response to
the public concerns regarding the Horizon IT System and its wrongful prosecution of SPMs. The
Inquiry may well also conclude that the handling of the Clarke Advice by the lawyers who were
aware of its content demonstrated a potential failure by those lawyers, both internal and external,

to comply with their professional duties, including duties of independence and to the Court.

PART 4. The group litigation: Bates & ors v Post Office Limited

50.

Sl.

52.

D3:

The Inquiry has been rightly concerned to identify what went wrong in the conduct of the Bates

& ors v Post Office Limited group litigation.

At the outset, Fujitsu makes one over-arching observation: Fujitsu was not party to the group
litigation. It follows that Fujitsu did not: (i) participate in those proceedings by way of adducing
evidence and submissions on its own behalf; (ii) control the conduct of the proceedings by Post
Office, including in relation to disclosure and witness evidence; or (iii) have disclosure
obligations of its own in connection with the proceedings. It is right to say that some Fujitsu
employees provided information and support to Post Office in connection with the group
litigation, and that some Fujitsu employees provided evidence in support of Post Office in those
proceedings. Fujitsu recognises that Fraser J made a number of criticisms of the conduct of
Fujitsu (and of its employees), particularly in the Horizon Issues Judgment. However, it is right
to note that those criticisms were, with respect, made without the benefit of evidence or

submissions on behalf of Fujitsu in the proceedings.

Post Office advanced a number of positions in defence of the group litigation which were
obviously inconsistent with information which was known, or ought reasonably to have
been known, by Post Office at that time. Crucially, a number of the positions advanced by Post
Office in the group litigation appear inconsistent with information available to senior members
of the Post Office legal team at the relevant time. By way of illustration, Post Office averred that
the Horizon IT System was “robust”.® Fujitsu has already set out at §§30-31, above, why that
term is problematic and apt to mislead. In any event, it is clear that the pleading required
significant qualification, based upon information which was known to Post Office at the relevant

time (see the Annex, below).

Post Office continued to rely significantly upon information provided by Mr Jenkins in the

group litigation,” at a time when Post Office had concluded that Mr Jenkins was ‘tainted’

POL00113328, Post Office’s Written Opening Submissions: Horizon Issues Trial, §19 (“The evidence
shows that Horizon is a robust system which works at least as well as any comparable system”).

See, for example, WITN00460400, Fourth Witness Statement of Gareth Jenkins, dated 29 April 2024, §181
(“I worked collaboratively with (then) current employees of Fujitsu, in particular John Simpkins, Steve
Parker and Torstein Godeseth (as well as others on occasion such as Alan Holmes, Mark Wright and Gareth
Seemungal) to provide technical information to POL and its lawyers, Womble Bond Dickinson (WBD). We
gave this technical information in relation to those parts of the expert and witness evidence which WBD
asked us to assist with”; see further INQ00001166, Transcript, 25 June 2024, p.13, In.4-8 and p.14, In.25-
p.15, In.10 (Mr Gareth Jenkins) (Regarding his engagement in the group litigation, Mr Jenkins states (i) he
was working “probably an average of about one to two days a week, for a period of about five or six months”,
and (ii) in 2018 to 2019, he recalls doing preparation work for what he now realises was the group litigation)

as an expert witness.” That was not appropriate (at least, without clear disclosure of that fact,
and the basis of Post Office’s concerns). Further, in the group litigation, Post Office continued to
conceal the concerns expressed by Mr Clarke regarding Mr Jenkins. The Inquiry has heard how
the decision not to call Mr Jenkins as a witness was made when Post Office’s external legal team
was informed that he “was not a reliable witness” as he had “given misleading evidence” in past
cases.”? However, the reason underlying this decision, that Mr Jenkins “had said things and not
said things in criminal proceedings which would have undermined his credibility as a witness”,
was not communicated to the Court or the Claimants.” Fujitsu had no role in the decision not to

call Mr Jenkins nor in determining what the Court was told as to the reason for that decision.

Post Office adopted a particularly aggressive litigation strategy, in connection with the
group litigation. The advice provided by Womble Bond Dickinson in September 2017 was that
a strategy of “attrition” was a legitimate one, the hallmark of which was to “stretch out the
litigation process to increase costs in the hope that the Claimants, and more particularly their
litigation funder, decide that it is too costly to pursue the litigation and give up”. This was

followed by advice in November 2018 that “¢actically, the best options for PO are (i) to force the

Cs to burn money”.”

In March 2019, Post Office pursued its, ultimately unsuccessful, application for Fraser J to recuse
himself on the basis of advice from Lord Grabiner and Lord Neuberger. This was despite a lack
of enthusiasm within (i) the Post Office Board”, and (ii) the Department for Business, Energy &
Industrial Strategy (“BEIS”), regarding the application. In particular, BEIS deemed the
application “unlikely to succeed and too likely to aggravate the situation and prolong the
litigation process”.”’ According to Sir Alex Chisholm, the application “was the wrong move
strategically and presentationally, as well as on the substance” and it risked “positioning POL in

public as aggressive and in denial about its shortcomings (which impression would be consistent

2978,

with the judge’ findings to date)”.

Post Office’s conduct was criticised by Fraser J in Bates & ors v Post Office Limited (No 3:
Common Issues) [2019] EWHC 606 (QB) (the “Common Issues Judgment’). Such criticisms

included that:

56.1. Post Office’s actions in relation to at least one Claimant during the early stages of the
litigation “could potentially be construed as threatening, oppressive, and potentially
discouraging to other potential Claimants to become involved in the litigation, whether by
accident or design” and that “the Post Office continued to act in a highly regrettable

fashion”.”

56.2. In relation to Post Office’s approach to the preservation and disclosure of relevant
documents to the same Claimant, “This would be a worrying position were it to be adopted
by any litigant; the Post Office is an organisation responsible for providing a public

service, which in my judgment makes it even worse”.®®

56.3. There was a “culture of excessive secrecy at the Post Office about the whole subject matter
of this litigation. They are directly contrary to how the Post Office should be conducting

itself’!

56.4. “Post Office in particular has resisted timely resolution of this Group Litigation whenever
it can” and that “J do not intend to allow this litigation to become wholly bogged down
with considerable costs rising on both sides, whether that approach is a specific one being

sought for forensic reasons, or an unintended side effect”.

56.5. Attempts were made by Post Office to “put the court in terrorem” by “threatening dire

consequences to national business should their case not be preferred”.

Post Office’s litigation strategy has been equally criticised by those working at BEIS at the
relevant time. By way of example, Sir Alex Chisholm, then Permanent Secretary to BEIS,
described Post Office’s conduct of the group litigation as having “exposed historic failings in

POL’: dealing with SPMs and POL’s complacency in preparing for and reacting to the adverse

judgment”.

Post Office and its legal advisors used legal professional privilege to cease the
implementation of Jonathan Swift QC’s (as he then was) recommendations. In or around
June and July 2016, Post Office sought legal advice, which was designed to provide cover to a
decision to bring to an immediate end the work being undertaken in relation to the
recommendations set out in the report prepared by Mr Jonathan Swift QC (as he then was) and
Mr Christopher Knight earlier that year (the “Swift Review”), and instead to address these
recommendations “under the aegis of the litigation”.6> By way of summary of the relevant

timeline:

58.1. On 8 June 2024, Andrew Parsons of Womble Bond Dickinson stated in an email to
Anthony de Garr Robinson KC that “Tim Parker, POL’ chairman, feels that he has made
a commitment to Baroness Neville Rolfe (Minister at BIS) to follow through on the [Swift]
recommendations unless he is presented with a persuasive case not to do so. POL are
therefore looking to us (and quite frankly you with your magic QC seal!) to give them some
reasons for Tim completing the [Swift] recommendations would be ill-advised”. Mr
Parsons suggested reasons why Mr Parker should not continue work on the
recommendations in the Swift Review, including that “there is a greater risk that this work
is not privileged [...]. It would be much safer for these investigations to be conducted as
part of the litigation”. Mr Parsons further noted “/’m conscious that this feels somewhat

unpleasant in that we are being asked to provide political cover for [Mr Parker]” *°

58.2. On 10 June 2016, Jane MacLeod (then-General Counsel of Post Office) stated in an email
to Mr Parker that “we met with [Mr de Garr Robinson KC] last night to discuss the
Postmaster Litigation” and that “His strong advice was that the work being undertaken
under the aegis of your review should not continue in light of the litigation. However, he
also recommended that the subject matter of that work should continue provided it is re-
scoped and re-instructed for the purposes of the litigation” .*”

58.3. A letter from Mr Parsons to Post Office dated 21 June 2016 referred to Mr de Garr
Robinson KC’s “very strong advice” that “Mr Parker s review should cease immediately.
Given the overlap of issues between Mr Parker's review and the Group Action, Mr

Robinson advised that it would still be prudent for Post Office to implement the 4", 5", 6"

and 8" recommendations of Mr Swift to the extent that these were required to advance Post
Office's case in the Group Action and as appropriately adapted to meet the needs of the
litigation. This work should however be instructed and overseen exclusively by Post
Offices legal team [...] so to maximise the prospect of asserting privilege over this work
and protect against the risk that material related to these actions could be disclosed to the
Claimants in the Group Action, undermining Post Office's prospects of success and/or
negotiating position”.** Mr de Garr Robinson KC accepted in oral evidence to the Inquiry
that the advice recorded in this letter (to take the recommendations forward insofar as they
advanced Post Office’s case) differed from that set out in his emails with Mr Parsons dated

8 June 2016."

Post Office and its legal advisors took a restrictive approach to disclosure in the group

litigation. In relation to Post Office’s approach to its disclosure duties in the group litigation,

Post Office was advised by Womble Bond Dickinson to withhold its Investigations Guidelines

from disclosure “until such time as we sense the criticism is becoming serious”. No objection to

this approach was mounted by Post Office’s internal lawyers.”

In a draft Post Office Board update dated 19 October 2019 regarding the disclosure of new KELs

to the Claimants, Mr Williams wrote that

60.1. “In relation to the other KELs not used at the trial (i.e. the majority of the c.14,000 new
KELs), the key risk of reviewing these is that the Claimants have not yet asked for the
documents so by reviewing them now we are doing the Claimants’ work for them”.

60.2. “The legal advice therefore is that we should not review the 14,000 other KELs unless the
Claimants ask for them”.

60.3. “The best way to mitigate the risk of generating adverse/disclosable documents through

an audit is to keep it focussed on Fujitsu’ litigation support provided to date, with any
operational audit to follow once the litigation has been resolved and its associated

disclosure duties concluded”.

Mr Williams accepted in oral evidence that the suggested approach set out in his Board update
was that Post Office “shouldnt look at documents that might contain adverse material because
we might have to disclose them; instead, lets wait until the litigation is over and our duties of
disclosure have ceased to arise” and that this was “a way to mitigate risk”.°”

Notwithstanding that Fujitsu was not a party to the group litigation, it accepts that it did
not properly support its staff who engaged directly with Post Office and its lawyers in
respect of the group litigation. These roles again fell outside of Fujitsu’s usual work as an IT
services provider. With this context, there are examples where, at times, Fujitsu could have
exercised additional rigour when supporting these individuals in their engagement with Post

Office and its legal advisors during the group litigation. These examples include:

62.1. Matthew Lenton, Document Manager at Fujitsu, accepted in oral evidence that with
hindsight he did not think there was much oversight by Fujitsu in the processes he was
carrying out. He stated that, with advice, oversight and more resource, there would have
been the capacity for greater information gathering “to be sure that we had all of the
information that was available”.

62.2. Peter Newsome, Account Manager in the Post Office Account, noted in his statement to
the Inquiry that the information and records provided by Fujitsu to Post Office in respect
of remote access functionality in Legacy Horizon was not adequate. Mr Newsome
considered that the error in this case was relying on documentation, as opposed to asking

members of the support teams about their knowledge.

62.3. In the context of the late disclosure of KELs, Mr Newsome and Mr Lenton recognised that
the statement in Post Office’s electronic disclosure questionnaire,®* that previous entries /
versions of the current KEL entries were no longer available, was incorrect.°° Mr Newsome
acknowledges that the contents of Post Office’s electronic disclosure questionnaire should
have been checked with subject matter experts before comments were provided to Womble

Bond Dickinson.”

PART 5. Governance

63. Phases 6 and 7 of the Inquiry have rightly considered the extent to which relevant governance
failings contributed to, or exacerbated, the matters at issue in this Inquiry. It is clear that there
were a number of relevant governance failings. In these submissions, Fujitsu addresses: (i)
governance fallings by ShEx / DTI (i.e. by Government); (ii) governance failings by Post Office;
and (iii) governance failings by Fujitsu. As is made clear at 5.3, below, Fujitsu candidly accepts

that the evidence discloses its own share of governance failings.

5.1 Governance failings by ShEx / DTI

64. It would be open to the Inquiry to conclude, on the evidence now available, that Government
consistently failed properly to oversee and manage the affairs of Post Office. There were a number
of significant missed opportunities in the oversight of Post Office by ShEx / DTI, and an overall
surprising lack of curiosity by those in Government responsible for the management of the affairs

of Post Office. In particular:

65. It would appear that the maintenance of a rigid distinction between ‘operational’ and ‘strategic’
issues appears to have insulated Post Office’s IT and prosecution functions from oversight by

ShEx / DTI for much of the Inquiry’s relevant period. That is surprising:

65.1. On one level, it may be doubted that problems with the integrity of the Horizon IT System
(in particular, together with Post Office’s systemised prosecution function) are properly
characterised as ‘operational’ matters. Post Office’s private prosecution function was a
highly unusual part of Post Office’s business — and one which carried unique and
substantial risks to Post Office and to Government.** Indeed, certain ShEx witnesses
specifically recognised the strategic significance of Post Office’s prosecution function —

not least because of its potential for significant impacts upon third parties (i.e. SPMs)?”

°8  WITN11260100, First Witness statement of Michael Whitehead, dated 17 October 2024, §§27, 29 (“For the
avoidance of doubt, I do not consider that it was the role of ShEx to oversee or monitor the conduct of
prosecutions at an operational level, as this was the responsibility of the Post Office. Our interest in SPM
prosecutions arose from our overarching requirement to ensure that the appropriate governance structures
to manage such activities were in place, as well as the need to seek information in relation to specific c
as a result of correspondence to Ministers from MPs, direct representations by SPMs, or, later, approaches
by the JFSA.” Further, Mr Whitehead quotes Stephen Byers MP’s speech to Parliament dated 8 July 1999
(RLIT0000219) (“although the Government will set out clear objectives for the Post Office, they will not be
involved in the day to day business operations: In line with this policy statement, the stance taken by ShEx
and the Department was that complaints relating to the Horizon IT system were operational matters for the
Post Office”).

65.2. Even when issues concerning the Horizon IT System were identified as a risk, the evidence

suggests that the nature of that risk was persistently downplayed.'”

66. Nonetheless, issues concerning the integrity of data produced by the Horizon IT System, and the
propriety of Post Office led prosecutions, were consistently brought to the attention of officials

within ShEx / DTI during the Inquiry’s relevant period. By way of illustration:

66.1. From as early as 2011/12, ShEx were liaising with Post Office regarding responses to
growing public concerns regarding the integrity of the Horizon IT System."! A 27 June
2012 briefing note prepared by Mike Whitehead of ShEx for a meeting with the Justice for
Sub-Postmasters Alliance, while noting that “the concerns raised by JFSA relate to

operational and contractual matters for POL”, nonetheless plainly lent ShEx support to

Post Office’s “view ... that the system is fully robust” I

66.2. From 2012, Post Office provided ShEx with routine updates concerning the progress of
cases against SPMs, and circumstances in which challenges to the integrity of the Horizon

IT System had been raised.'

66.3. ShEx were also provided with regular updates concerning the progress of the Second Sight
investigation.' On 8 July 2013, the Second Sight Interim Report was published."°> That
report confirmed, amongst other things, that two BEDs had led to errors in branch accounts

(in addition to, amongst other things, failings in training, helpdesk, root cause analysis and

never saw much progress”).

investigations). At least a summary of that report was made available to ShEx at around
the time of its publication.'°° ShEx officials told the Inquiry that they did not, at the time,
appreciate the significance of Second Sight’s conclusions (including as to the integrity of
the Horizon IT System).'°’ Such an oversight raises real concerns as to the sufficiency of

ShEx risk management.

67. However:

67.1. It would appear that there was also a failure of information sharing within ShEx / DTI such
that, although relevant information (for example, concerning matters relevant to the
integrity of the Horizon IT System) were known to some ShEx / DTI officials, they were
not appropriately escalated to the ShEx / DTI Boards, or to Ministers. By way of
illustration, Patrick O’Sullivan (Chair of the ShEx Board at a critical period from March
2012 to September 2014) provided the Inquiry with an extensive list of matters not
ultimately raised by officials with the ShEx Board, including the existence of BEDs in the
Horizon IT System, the ‘Helen Rose Report’, the Second Sight Interim Report, the Clarke
Advice, the Deloitte ‘Project Zebra’ report, etc.'°* The Inquiry may well conclude that this
reflected a significant breakdown in oversight arrangements. Sir Stephen Lovegrove’s
assessment is to similar effect: “Jt appears that information did not flow as it should have
done, so that those charged with overseeing the governance of POL, starting with officers

in POL itself, were unaware of the risk, or even in some instances that POL was responsible

for prosecuting sub-postmasters using Horizon data”.'°

67.2. Further, the Inquiry may well conclude that ShEx / DTI failed to recognise those matters

as reflective of a systemic problem within Post Office.'!° That is, they were treated as

isolated incidents, to be managed and responded to on an individual basis.'!' Sir Stephen
(rightly) accepted that the failure by ShEx to identify, (i) the risk of errors in the Horizon
IT System, and (ii) risks associated with Post Office investigations and prosecutions, on

ShEx’s risk register was a significant oversight.'!?

67.3. In any event, the Inquiry may well conclude that ShEx / DTI failed to respond
appropriately to those concerns.'' It may be that, as a number of ShEx witnesses
suggested,'' officials simply failed to appreciate the significance of the issues brought to
their attention (in the context of other, broader, concerns regarding the operations of the
Post Office). However, the inescapable conclusion from the chronology set out at §66

above, is that there were a number of significant missed opportunities.

68. The Inquiry may well conclude that the evidence in Phase 6 demonstrated a striking divergence
in expectations between, on the one hand, ShEx / DTI officials and, on the other hand, relevant
Ministers, concerning the role which was to be performed by ShEx / DTI in respect of arm’s

length bodies such as Post Office:

68.1. In his evidence, Mr O’Sullivan was emphatic in stating that it was “not ShEx’s role to

second guess ... what the POL Board was doing”, and that he was not concerned that ShEx

(Mr Richard Callard) (“7 wasn't really concerned about systemic failures in that sense because I thought,
well, a very sensible way to look for problems with the system is to -- rather than look top-down is to look at
the things that people are saying, and investigate those individually”) and (“[T]o my mind, those instances
where it might be just single one-off were being investigated and, if there was a problem, I hoped, with the
combination of Post Office and then Second Sight looking at it, that that error would be found.”);

officials were providing “/t/he messaging from post Office”, because it was for the Post

Office Board to “determine the significance of these issues” (i.e. to determine the

‘message’).!!5

68.2. That evidence stands in contrast to that of a number of relevant Ministers, who plainly
expected ShEx to provide more robust scrutiny of the ‘messages’ provided by Post Office.
For example, Pat McFadden’s evidence was that he “relied on ShEx for briefings and, as
with other policy areas, expected information on these matters to be true, accurate, and
reliable” (i.e. he relied upon ShEx to interrogate information provided by Post Office).''®
Margot James was clear in her criticisms of the quality of the information provided by
ShEx: “With hindsight I feel that I was not properly or adequately briefed by UKGI on the
scope of the issues pertaining to Horizon”.'"” Further, Kelly Tolhurst expressed concerns
that Tom Cooper of ShEx had “gone native” and “lost his independence from POL and was

not providing effective challenge or scrutiny”, such that she “/lost] confidence in Mr

Cooper”."8

69. It is clear that successive relevant Ministers were aware of concerns regarding the integrity of the
Horizon IT System, and many relevant Ministers were also aware of the potentially serious
implications of those concerns for the conduct of Post Office prosecutions.'!? Indeed, many
relevant Ministers had become aware of such issues initially as constituency matters affecting
their own constituents, or those of their colleagues.'?” Concerningly, however, there is evidence
that, in some circumstances, Post Office and/or ShEx / DTI officials frustrated, rather than

facilitated effective oversight of Post Office by Ministers. In particular:

was requested, but I did feel that details were not always forthcoming in a proactive way”,

69.2. A particularly striking example which emerged in the evidence before the Inquiry was in
ShEx’s response to the Common Issues Judgment. Greg Clark’s evidence was that, as
Secretary of State, he regarded the Common Issues Judgment as “seminal”, not least

because it made clear Fraser J’s conclusion that “the Post Office had behaved disreputably

... and to the considerable detriment of the claimants”.'°5 Mr Clark arranged a meeting the

following day (a Saturday morning) with officials, during which Mr Clark said that he was
“pretty emphatic” that his “objective [was] to see justice done”.'° Nonetheless, the
evidence establishes that the “emphatic” views of Ministers were, at the intervention of
ShEx, not communicated to the Post Office Board.'” In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr
Clark’s assessment of this episode was frank: “/ thought it was outrageous that UKGI
contrived to keep the unambiguous view of ministers from the Post Office Board ... I
thought [Mr Cooper of UKGI’s statement that he had ‘no intention of engineering’ a

situation where the Minister could object to a recusal application regarding Fraser J] was

wrong and appalling”. The Inquiry may well take the same view.

‘Dear Colleagues’ letter concerning the implications of Fraser J’s judgment, which had the
effect of “water[ing] down the sentiment held by me and the Secretary of State”. Ms
Tolhurst considered this to be reflective of Post Office “not really accepting the [judgment]

Governance failings by Post Office

The Inquiry has heard considerable evidence of serious governance failures within Post Office.
It is clear beyond argument that those governance failures contributed to the significant
miscarriages of justice which are the subject of this Inquiry. For example, there is evidence of a
problematic culture within Post Office, which was inherently hostile to SPMs, which did not take
seriously concerns raised by SPMs, and which was inappropriately defensive of Post Office and

the Horizon IT System. A number of witnesses described that toxic culture:

70.1. The evidence of Jane Hill, Post Office’s Head of Public Affairs from 2013 to 2020, was
that she found the communication strategy employed by Post Office with Lord Arbuthnot
and other Members of Parliament raising concerns about the Horizon IT System “to be
very robust and defensive”.'*° Ms Hill recalls that the “strategy was to demonstrate what
the mediation scheme was doing and what it was designed to achieve rather than engage
in the suggestion that the SPMs had been treated unfairly or that there was a flaw in the

Horizon system”."*!

70.2. Robert Swannell’s evidence was that, in around 2019, Post Office’s culture was “shocking”

—a “closed, defensive culture”, which was “toxic”.

70.3. In his 19 November 2020 ‘What Went Wrong? A Draft for Discussion’ document, Mr
Cameron described Post Office as having “maintained an unacceptable relationship with
Postmasters that was self-serving, based on an imbalance of power and information and
a skewed contract’." Mr Cameron’s view was that (i) Post Office’s “culture, self:
absorbed and defensive, stopped [Post Office] from dealing with Postmasters in a
straightforward and acceptable way”, and (ii) Post Office’s problems with SPMs “were

cultural before they were contractual” .'34

70.4. Henry Staunton considered that Post Office had “an issue with regard to cultures and how

poorly postmasters were viewed by the organisation”.'*5

70.5. The SPM Non-Executive Directors on the Post Office Board, Mr Saf Ismail and Mr Elliot
Jacobs recorded, as recently as January 2024, that Post Office had a culture that “Post
Masters are not to be trusted’, that those SPMs who had not come forward to have their
convictions overturned were “guilty as charged”, and that there was a ‘mantra’ that “all
[SPMs] are on the take”.'*° Notably, Mr Staunton’s evidence was that he “totally agreed”

with the cultural issues identified by Mr Ismail and Mr Jacobs. '*”

Further, there is evidence ofa concerning failure by senior staff within Post Office to share serious
concerns regarding the Horizon IT System, and the propriety of Post Office’s prosecution of

SPMs, with the Post Office Board. By way of illustration:

71.1. In September 2011 (during her first month on the Post Office Board), Alice Perkins
attended a meeting with Angus Grant, the Ernst & Young partner responsible for the Post
Office audit account. That was a meeting without any Post Office executives present. Ms
Perkins’ hand-written note of that meeting'** makes clear that Mr Grant told Ms Perkins
that: (i) in contractual negotiations with Fujitsu, Post Office “drove a very hard bargain on

price” which had compromised “quality/assurance”; (ii) that “Horizon ...

is a real risk for
us” — with issues including “Does it capture data accurately” and “Cases of fraud —
suspects suggest it’s a systems problem”. Ms Perkins inevitably accepted in evidence that
this was a “very significant piece of information to receive”."? There is no evidence that
Ms Perkins communicated that “very significant” information to any person (whether any
Post Office executive, any other member of the Post Office Board, or anyone in
Government). '*° That is totally incomprehensible. More surprisingly, there is no evidence
that these “very significant” disclosures from Ernst & Young informed Ms Perkins’
conduct in relation to the emerging public scandal (in which Ms Perkins played a critical
role in shaping Post Office’s response) in any respect whatsoever. Again, that is (at

minimum) a significant governance failure.

71.2. In February 2016, when then-Chair of the Post Office Board, Mr Parker, received the Swift
Review, a decision was taken not to share that report with the Board. Mr Parker’s evidence
was that he received advice from then-General Counsel, Ms MacLeod, the effect of which
he understood to be that he should not brief the Board on the contents of the Swift Review
‘on grounds of legal professional privilege.'*! Ms MacLeod disputes that evidence. '*? In
the event, the critical point (from a governance and culture perspective) would seem to be
that the failure to disseminate the Swift Review more widely among senior Post Office

leadership is a matter of real concern.

71.3. In other instances, information was plainly sanitised before being provided to the Post
Office Board. As the Inquiry is aware, the report to the Board following the Second Sight
Interim Report underwent a number of revisions — including amending a sentence which
would have informed the Board that Post Office “external lawyers have advised ... that
they believe there will be around 5-10% of [convictions] which may be successfully
overturned and the convictions quashed”.'** This was amended to suggest that lawyers
believed “there will be around 5% where they need to disclose the additional evidence”.'“
Ms Crichton accepted that she “must have” made that amendment, and that it reflected a
“very significant difference”, but denied that it had been “intentionally watered down”

(despite the obvious inference arising from the terms of Ms Crichton’s amendment).'*°

Further, as Fujitsu has previously submitted,"° there is evidence that information concerning
BEDs within the Horizon IT System was ‘siloed’ within various Post Office teams ~ indicating a
concerning lack of information sharing. That is, notwithstanding that information concerning
BEDs was widely known within Post Office, it would also be open to the Inquiry to conclude
that, (i) organisational silos within Post Office contributed to a failure by certain staff within Post
Office to consider that BEDs in the Horizon IT System were capable of producing transaction
errors and impacting upon branch accounts, and (ii) significantly, there was a routine failure by
Post Office staff (particularly within the investigations team) to share internally important

information concerning integrity issues identified in the Horizon IT System with their

colleagues. '*” That was a critical missed opportunity.

5.3. Governance failings by Fujitsu

73. Fujitsu recognises that the evidence concerning governance issues received by the Inquiry in
Phases 5, 6 and 7 was predominantly given by current and former employees of Post Office and
Government. Nonetheless, Fujitsu has reflected upon, and candidly accepts its own governance

failings. In particular:

73.1. Fujitsu failed properly to consider whether its contractual prosecution support obligations
were consistent with Fujitsu’s fundamental corporate values. That is, in agreeing to support
Post Office in its conduct of criminal investigations and prosecutions, Fujitsu’s leadership
failed to critically assess whether the provision of such support was consistent with
Fujitsu’s corporate values. As above, the contractual prosecution support obligations were

atypical for Fujitsu, and certainly well outside the typical work of Fujitsu technical staff.

73.2. As Fujitsu has acknowledged at §39 above, it failed properly to support those engaged in
the provision of prosecution support (and, in particular, those engaged in providing witness

evidence in support of Post Office proceedings).

73.3. As Fujitsu has acknowledged at §43 above, Fujitsu deeply regrets that, at times, it adopted
a position which was defensive in relation to the Horizon IT System and that its senior

management were insufficiently interventionist.

73.4. As acknowledged in its Phase 4 Closing Submissions, Fujitsu failed to act on Mrs
Chambers’ ‘Afterthoughts’ memo, which identified a number of important shortcomings
in respect of her instruction as a witness in the POL v Castleton case. These included the
following: (i) Mrs Chambers was asked to liaise directly with solicitors to the Post Office,

Mrs Chambers

rather than such conduct being ‘mediated’ by Fujitsu’s own legal team;

was repeatedly assured that a court attendance would not be necessary, which assurances

“proved to be unfounded”, (iii) the initial analysis which Mrs Chambers performed

involved no “technical review of the Horizon evidence”; and (iv) Mrs Chambers was

147 See, for example: WITN05S850100, First Witness Statement of Davyd Nash, dated 16 August 2024, §$34-
36. Mr Nash recalls an incident in 2015 where he emailed a Post Office operational team about an issue that
he believed (at the time) could have led to branches being potentially “flagged up as committing fraud” due
to the SPM making an inadvertent error on the Horizon IT System. Ms Van Den Bogerd was forwarded this
email and according to Mr Nash “/Ms Van Den Bogerd] informed us that we must stop sending emails related
to this and commit nothing in writing until we had discussed it with her [...] and the explanation from Angela
Van Den Bogerd was that this could affect cases of ex-postmasters who had been caught committing fraud,

and who were now looking for an excuse to ‘get off ’— and this issue might have given them that ‘excuse’.

40
SUBS0000067
SUBS0000067

surprised that she “found [herself] being treated as an expert witness and answering a
wide variety of questions about the system, although nominally [she] was a witness of
fact”. Fujitsu accepts that Mrs Chambers’ identification of these shortcomings involved
properly justified criticisms of Fujitsu. Fujitsu also accepts that following Mrs Chambers’
identification of those shortcomings, Fujitsu failed to implement sufficiently robust
mechanisms to support its employees in the provision of witness evidence in Post Office

cases, Fujitsu deeply regrets that missed opportunity.

PART 6. Lessons learned

74. The public rightly expect those involved in the matters addressed in this Inquiry to have learned
appropriate lessons, so as to safeguard relevant technological, human, and governance systems
and ensure that this appalling miscarriage of justice can never be repeated. With that in mind,
Fujitsu addresses three important topics: (i) Ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions;

(ii) NBIT; and (iii) Fujitsu’s own remediation efforts.

75. Fujitsu was concerned by the results of the YouGov Survey commissioned by the Inquiry to
capture the experience of current SPMs using the Horizon IT System today.'** Of particular note
to Fujitsu was the finding that 92% of the SPMs who responded to the survey had experienced
issues with the Horizon IT System over the course of the last 12 months, with 57% having
experienced unexplained discrepancies during that time. As stated by Paul Patterson in his
evidence to the Inquiry, there are any number of reasons why these discrepancies are continuing
to occur, including as a result of issues in aspects of the Horizon IT System that are managed and
maintained by third parties other than Fujitsu. All such aspects of the Horizon IT System, as well
as Post Office business processes relating to balancing and accounting, need to be investigated

in order for a comprehensive explanation to be provided as to the cause of these discrepancies.'”

76. One important topic which Fujitsu does not address in this Part 6 is financial redress and
compensation. Fujitsu recognises the importance of that topic to affected SPMs and their families.
Fujitsu will engage with Government on contribution to the Government’s compensation costs.

The timing of this engagement will commence once this Inquiry has published its findings.

6.1 Ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions

77. In the course of Phase 7, the Inquiry explored with a number of witnesses issues regarding
ongoing and future criminal investigations and prosecutions involving Post Office. Post Office’s
renewed interest in criminal investigations and prosecutions appears driven by a perceived need

within Post Office (i) for a deterrent,'S° and (ii) to recover apparent shortfalls.'S' A significant

Patterson).

150 See, for example, BEIS0000789, Minutes of a Post Office Quarterly Shareholder Meeting on 10 January
2023 attended by representatives from Post Office, BEIS and ShEx, p.4: “/t was noted as not a good time to

postmaster refusing to make any shortages good. [sic] One recourse in these situations would be to take the

42
SUBS0000067
SUBS0000067

focus of that evidence (and, regrettably, a source of confusion in the Phase 7 evidence) was on
the nature of assistance, if any, which Fujitsu had provided, or was willing to provide, in support
of such investigations. This is a significant issue because, according to a Post Office paper entitled
‘passing material to law enforcement’ dated 26 June 2024, at that time there were “22 police
forces requesting or awaiting Horizon-based evidence across 33 police investigations”.'?
Moreover, Post Office’s engagement with ongoing law enforcement investigations raises real
questions as to the extent to which lessons have been learned regarding the matters which have

been the subject of this Inquiry.

78. To date, Fujitsu has been contacted by only four police forces in relation to four cases.'*> Fujitsu
does not know why it has not been contacted by the other police forces, or in connection with the

other investigations.

79.  Fujitsu’s position regarding ongoing and future criminal prosecutions has remained consistent
since its declared position in its 16 June 2020 letter to the BEIS Select Committee that it will
provide information to the police or other appropriate judicial authorities (see §79.3 below). That
is consistent with the explanation provided by Mr Patterson in his evidence to the Inquiry.'™

Further:

79.1. Fujitsu has offered,'*> and will continue to offer, full cooperation to any police force
conducting an investigation into potential criminal wrongdoing in connection with Post
Office branches. Fujitsu will also, where appropriate and necessary, cooperate with police
forces in the preparation of factual witness statements to address matters relevant to those

criminal investigations.

postmaster to court - but on the many cases we have tested - we are very short of the evidence that would be
required”. Further, the document notes that “With tremendous effort in Territories and BSM the shortages
were brought back to acceptable levels at the Year End (£3.6M)”. Fujitsu observes that this acceptable level
of shortages mirrors exactly the number provided by Mr Bartlett during his evidence to the Inquiry when
asked what the current figure is: “if you take it as not what could be recovered by the total value of potential
loss, is [sic] about 3.6 million” (INQ00001198, Transcript, 17 October 2024, p.85, In.11-In.15 (Mr John

79.2. Fujitsu is, however, determined not to repeat mistakes of the past, which have been so
starkly revealed by this Inquiry. In this context: (@) Fujitsu is acutely aware that it is not in
a position to offer independent expert opinion, from any employee, regarding the operation
of the Horizon IT System; (ii) Fujitsu is also aware of the need to make full and appropriate
disclosure regarding its knowledge of BEDs in the Horizon IT System (including the
potential for unknown, undiscovered, and unresolved BEDs affecting the live system,
particularly as it ages without further investment) and the existence of substantive remote
access; and (iii) Fujitsu is also mindful that a consistent theme of the evidence before the
Inquiry was the error, in producing evidence for criminal proceedings arising from Horizon
IT System data, of focussing overly narrowly on whether there is specific evidence of a
BED affecting a particular branch at a particular time, as compared to the potential for
BEDs (including unknown BEDs) within the network more broadly, and is eager that
police forces do not repeat the same error (i.e. by asking Fujitsu to provide evidence limited

to a particular branch).

79.3. As explained in Fujitsu’s 16 June 2020 letter to Darren Jones MP, Chair of the BEIS
Strategy Committee,'® Fujitsu “will not provide witness evidence in the future to support
Post Office led prosecutions of sub-postmasters”.'*’ That reflects a decision, taken by
Fujitsu, on the basis of real concerns as to the probity and integrity of Post Office’s
investigation and internal prosecution functions — not least those demonstrated clearly in
the evidence before the Inquiry. However, Fujitsu’s position does not, in reality, present
any impediment to criminal investigations because, in his letter to Mr Patterson dated 30
May 2024, Nick Read confirmed that “Post Office is not now - and will not be in the future
- undertaking any prosecutions against postmasters or any third parties as the prosecuting
body”, and that such criminal investigations or prosecutions are pursued instead “by
independent third parties, such as the Police or the Crown Prosecution Service”.'*8 As

above, Fujitsu will continue to cooperate with investigations conducted by police forces.

80. Having made its position clear to the Inquiry, Fujitsu turns to address the relevant

correspondence.

156 POL00112955, Letter from Rob Putland to Darren Jones MP dated 16 June 2020. The letter was sent
following the criticisms in Fraser J’s Common Issues Judgment (FUJ00200281) and Horizon Issues
Judgment (AMCL0000013), but before the criticisms made by the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in
Post Office v Hamilton & ors. Fujitsu’s position is only fortified by the conclusions in the latter judgment.

It is important to understand the breadth of the requests which have been made of Fujitsu to date.
Fujitsu plainly is not in a position to provide independent expert opinion, from any employee,
regarding the operation of the Horizon IT System. Put shortly: no Fujitsu employee could
possibly give an independent opinion concerning the operation of the system, consistently with
the duties of an expert now enumerated in Criminal Procedure Rules 2020, r 19.2. Evidence is
‘opinion evidence’ where it expresses an inference drawn from perceived facts.'*? Evidence that
‘Horizon was working properly’ (generally, or at a particular branch) is opinion evidence —
because it involves an inference (‘Horizon was working properly’) drawn from facts (evidence
of known BEDs, evidence of systems for the identification and rectification BEDs, evidence as
to the use of remote access, transaction data, etc.). Moreover, it is expert opinion evidence,
because it requires particular technical qualifications and training for an individual properly to
draw such an inference. However, that is precisely the evidence which a number of police forces

have requested of Fujitsu. By way of illustration:

81.1. On 7 February 2024, City of London Police asked Fujitsu to provide “a statement

regarding the reliability if [sic] the current version of Horizon”.

81.2. On 23 May 2024, Police Scotland asked Fujitsu for “input from someone suitable at Fujitsu
to explain in layman’ terms why the data from the current or recent version of Horizon
can be relied upon in contrast to it’s [sic] predecessors. (In light of the ongoing enquiry
[sic], any prosecution that involves data from Horizon is going to need an extra strand or
two of evidence to give confidence that it can be relied upon. In the current climate, it
would be to [sic] easy for the defence to muddy the waters and claim Horizon cannot be
trusted without some robust evidence that this is not the same system that lies at the centre
of the controversy, and COPFS might need some extra reassurance that it is safe to proceed

with a case)”.'*!

81.3. On 30 May 2024, Sussex Police asked Fujitsu “to provide a statement attesting to the

pr 162

reliability and trustworthiness of the new Horizon system (post 2015)”.

81.4. On 7 June 2024, Lancashire Constabulary asked Fujitsu for “a formal signed statement /

report in an evidential format which shows why you believe the Horizon system in place at

[redacted] was reporting correctly...”.'®

Fujitsu has explained — both to Post Office, and to the relevant police forces — why it is unable to
comply with a request for expert opinion evidence (while reiterating its willingness to cooperate

with the production of, e.g., factual material). In particular:

82.1. Ina letter to Mr Read on 8 July 2024, Mr Patterson explained that “/a/ witness statement
from FSL attesting to the reliability of the system and of data from it in criminal
proceedings would amount to expert opinion evidence. FSL is incapable of providing
expert opinion evidence as it is neither independent nor has it sufficient information to
provide such an opinion”.'® A position repeated by Mr Patterson in his meeting with Owen

Woodley on 18 July 2024'®° and in Fujitsu’s Fifth Corporate Statement.'®

82.2. That position was ostensibly accepted by Post Office in Mr Woodley’s letter to
Mr Patterson on 23 July 2024'°” and by Mr Read when he gave evidence to the Inquiry on
9 October 2024, who had anticipated that relevant police forces would engage with Fujitsu
“on very specific issues”, and that he did not consider a “blanket expert statement was
necessarily what we were trying to achieve”.'°* John Bartlett in his evidence to the Inquiry
also understood Fujitsu to have been asked by relevant police forces to provide “evidence
of particular transactions at particular times, and that’s it, together with a description of

their Control Framework”.'°

82.3. Plainly, the quotes set out at §81 above demonstrate that Mr Read and Mr Bartlett were
mistaken — the relevant requests received by Fujitsu from the police forces were not “on
very specific issues”, nor were they requests for “evidence of particular transactions at
particular times, and that’s it”. Rather, they were plainly (and often in terms) requests for

opinion evidence, which Fujitsu is simply not in a position to provide.

Fujitsu has become particularly concerned by some of the correspondence it has reviewed

between Post Office and the relevant police forces.

On 25 April 2024, Mr Bartlett (with input from Post Office in-house criminal counsel Stuart Lill)
wrote to Lancashire Constabulary concerning a particular investigation which Lancashire
Constabulary had decided not to progress to a charging decision. '”° Post Office (via Mr Bartlett)
sought to encourage Lancashire Constabulary to review that decision. Several features of that

letter are significant:

84.1. The impression given by Mr Bartlett’s analysis of Fraser J’s Horizon Issues Judgment is
that the “numerous bugs errors and defects affecting the Horizon system that were capable
of generating unexplained shortfalls in branch accounts” were confined to Horizon Online
and HNG-X (and, by implication, do not affect the operation of the current broad phase of
the Horizon IT System, HNG-A). Such an impression is not consistent with Fraser J’s
finding (which was simply that HNG-A is “far more robust” — i.e., comparatively — than
“Horizon in earlier times”). To be clear: Fujitsu would not stand by any analysis which
suggested that HNG-A was ‘BED free’ — not least, because two of the BEDs in Fraser J’s
‘BED Table’ are recorded as having affected HNG-A. Fujitsu continues to identify and

manage BEDs as part of its operational services.

84.2. Mr Bartlett asserts that “/i/f the defence were to challenge the reliability of Horizon data,
which POL accepts is highly likely, the prosecution would be entitled to rely upon the
findings of Fraser J and the CACD as set out above”. That assertion is, as a matter of law,
obviously wrong. Mr Bartlett’s attempt to explain away his clear error of law was
incoherent, and impossible to reconcile with the language used in Mr Bartlett’s own letter
of 25 April 2024.'7' In criminal proceedings, the common law rule known as the ‘rule in
Hollington v F Hewthorn & Co Ltd’ means that a judgment or other decision by a court or
tribunal is not admissible in subsequent proceedings as evidence of the truth of the
decision, or of the grounds upon which it was made.'” Put shortly, in any future criminal
proceedings, the prosecution (or, for that matter, the defence) would not, as a matter of law,
be entitled to rely upon the factual findings in Fraser J’s Horizon Issues Judgment or in
Hamilton & ors. The prosecution would be required to prove, by admissible evidence, the

integrity of the Horizon IT System in each and every prosecution.

84.3. Mr Bartlett asserts that Post Office’s “analysis report ... that reviews transactions
conducted at the branch” supports Post Office’s belief that “Horizon was reporting

correctly throughout the period in question”. The evidence heard by this Inquiry in Phase 4

exposes why such a narrow approach — i.e. focusing solely on evidence from one particular
branch at a specific point in time, and seeking to identify evidence of the impact of a BED
— is apt to mislead. It should have been clear to Mr Bartlett that a wider investigation —
capable of identifying unknown, unidentified, and unrectified BEDs, and of testing the
strength of relevant controls and systems for identifying BEDs — would be required before
any assessment that “Horizon was reporting correctly throughout the period in question”

could possibly be appropriate.

There is no merit whatsoever to the suggestion (made principally by Mr Bartlett) that Fujitsu has
been obstructive or uncooperative with police investigations. Fujitsu is surprised by that
suggestion, which is plainly at odds with the evidence. Further, given the significant miscarriages
of justice with which this Inquiry is concerned, a cautious approach in these cases is both

reasonable and appropriate.

During August 2024, Fujitsu wrote to the four police forces which had sought assistance in
relation to criminal investigations.'” Those letters are entirely consistent with Fujitsu’s core
approach, described above. That is, they are consistent with Fujitsu’s intention to offer full
cooperation to any police force conducting an investigation into potential criminal wrongdoing
in connection with Post Office branches. Equally, they are consistent with Fujitsu’s (hopefully,
readily comprehensible) caution, in seeking in good faith to avoid any repetition of the serious

mistakes of the past, which have led to the matters considered by this Inquiry.

The Inquiry has ample evidence of Fujitsu’s cooperative approach with police investigations.'™
The reality is that many of these investigations are, insofar as they involve engagement with
Fujitsu, at a very early stage. Nonetheless, Fujitsu’s approach is entirely consistent with that

described above.

In view of the foregoing matters, attempts by the A&CI Team, and in particular Mr Bartlett, to
circumvent the scrutiny of the Post Office Board in relation to engagement with police forces

appear all the more problematic.

Post Office witnesses explained to the Inquiry that current policy requires approval from the Post
Office Board before evidence can be provided to police forces to support the criminal
investigation of SPMs.'° There has been some debate during Phase 7 as to the appropriateness

of such a policy, in relation to which Fujitsu does not comment.

During Phase 7, the Inquiry heard evidence from Mr Ismail, Rachel Scarrabelotti and Mr Read
in relation to a proposed change to Post Office’s policy surrounding cooperation with law

enforcement. In particular:

90.1. One of the papers tabled and noted by the Post Office Board during its meeting on
31 October 2023 related to a “discussion of broader policy change” in respect of the
disclosure of evidence to relevant police forces. The action recorded in respect of this item
was that “it could be valuable for Postmasters to look at the policies and process[es] in
place and perhaps for a mock case to be run under these’. It was suggested that “the

Postmaster director could participate” (the “October 2023 Action”).'”°

90.2. During the Post Office Board meeting on 4 June 2024, it was noted by Mr Ismail that the
October 2023 Action had been closed. Accordingly, Nigel Railton requested that “J
Bartlett attend the July Board meeting to clarify the proposed position”.!” When
discussing this meeting with the Inquiry, Mr Ismail explained that his “alarm bells were
ringing” when he saw the item had been closed. Mr Ismail’s view was that “this created
misinformation within the wider Executive, based on a decision that had not

o 178

happened...

90.3. On 26 June 2024, Mr Bartlett submitted to the Post Office Strategic Executive Group
(“Post Office SEG”) the paper entitled ‘passing of material to law enforcement’, which
proposed “a streamlining of the governance of providing law enforcement with
information”. In particular, the paper described the current involvement of the Post
Office Board in the authorisation process as “unnecessary”, and suggested that approvals
should instead be limited to, (i) the Director of the A&CI Team, Mr Bartlett, and, (ii) in-

house criminal counsel, Mr Lill (i.e., the authors of the 25 April 2024 letter to Lancashire

Constabulary). Post Office SEG declined to approve the submission of the paper to the
Post Office Board.

90.4. In her evidence to the Inquiry, Ms Scarrabelotti confirmed that this matter was not
resubmitted to the Post Office Board in July 2024, as stipulated by Mr Railton in June
2024, neither had the matter been resubmitted to the Board since.'*° It also appeared that

the consultation stipulated in the October 2023 Action had not yet been carried out.'*!

91. The appropriateness of Post Office’s current policy in respect of Post Office’s cooperation with
relevant police forces is a matter for the Inquiry. Fujitsu nevertheless observes that the actions
outlined above, which have the effect of circumventing Post Office’s current governance
processes and avoiding additional scrutiny by the Post Office Board, have been undertaken by
the same team within Post Office that has been described in evidence before this Inquiry as the

g?? 182

“untouchables”, and which (as above) have been responsible for some suspect

communications with police forces in connection with ongoing investigations.

6.2 New Branch IT System
92. In its opening statement to the Inquiry on 4 October 2022, Post Office submitted that it had
“embarked upon an ambitious and accelerated large-scale effort to retire Horizon by 2025 and

replace it with a new system”.'*3

93. Over the course of Phase 7, the Inquiry has received evidence concerning NBIT and the progress
that has been made towards replacing the Horizon IT System. Increasingly, it has become clear
that the NBIT programme has experienced prolonged delays and technical challenges. It has also
become clear that Post Office is no closer to replacing the Horizon IT System as it was at the time

of its opening statement in this Inquiry.

94. The Post Office Board and senior executives responsible for the NBIT programme, including its

two channels, the Strategic Platform Modernisation Programme (“SPMP”) and Retail

183 §UBS0000005, Opening Statement on behalf of Post Office Limited, §59. Post Office also submitted that
the design and testing for the new system was being “undertaken in conjunction with a focus group of 240
postmasters to ensure that their views and needs [were] fully taken into account’; initial “small-scale pilots
of the new system” had commenced in October 2022, which would be “carefully evaluated... before
gradually being expanded to more branches”; and by the time of Phase 7, Post Office would “be in a position
to demonstrate in real life what its future electronic point of sale system will look like”.

Transformation Programme (“RTP”),'** have been aware of delays and increased costs in the
NBIT programme since as early as June 2022. However, it appears that Post Office’s NBIT team
failed to report the full extent of the problems being experienced by the NBIT programme to the
Post Office Board and Post Office SEG, including in respect of BEDs in NBIT and the
management of the programme. This appears to have compounded the programme’s delays and
increased costs.'** In May 2023, Mr Staunton became aware that Mr Cameron had informed Jane
Davies that “he felt the full cost exposure of the NBIT replacement was being hidden from the
Board and that the Board would have a huge shock later in the year, once the true costs were
revealed”.'** Mr Staunton’s evidence is that he raised this with Mr Read who felt that Mr
Cameron was “overstating things”.'*"

95. On 27 June 2023, an anonymous whistleblower going by the monicker, ‘John Doe’, emailed Mr
Staunton and raised concerns about NBIT (the “John Doe Report”). The John Doe Report
alleged that: “The disaster of NBIT [was] well known across different levels within the
business”.'*’ Further ‘John Doe’ alleged that Mr Read had been told by multiple individuals that
the NBIT team and “CIO”, which is understood to refer to Zdravko Mladenovy, had told the Post
Office Board “wntruths... about the extent of defects and timescales” for NBIT’s Release 2
rollout. These defects were “not under control”.!® It was alleged that the NBIT and RTP teams
worked in silos, and the NBIT team was “secretive and told not to share updates or information
with anyone from the wider business”.'°° Mr Mladenov was said to have been “open about
misleading the [Post Office] Board with inaccurate dates and costs for NBIT and [was] incapable
of making a decision or having a difficult conversation. He [had] no previous delivery experience
and [had] openly said to members of his team that he [was] doing this job to get the experience
because hes never done any delivery before”.'°! When this section of the John Doe Report was
put to Mr Staunton, he noted that “clearly, when you see a project go up to £1 billion from £300

million in the course of three months, clearly something is being hidden from you".'? The author

184 Tt appears from the documentary evidence that Post Office’s project to replace Horizon was initially known

as the SPMP, Following a restructuring in or around May 2023, it appears that the project was then called
the “NBIT programme”, which had two channels or workstreams, the SPMP and RTP (see, for example,

concluded that there had been “no governance in place for NBIT for a long time and what had
been in place had not done what it was supposed to”.'°* It appears that the allegations in the John
Doe Report concerning the misinformation provided to SEG and the Post Office Board on NBIT

are now being investigated by Pinsent Masons and Grant Thornton as part of Project Willow 2.!%4

The evidence in Phase 7 has demonstrated that Post Office has underestimated and failed to
appropriately assess the scale of the work required to deliver the NBIT programme, including the
time and resources needed to develop and roll out the technical solution. The system is
“significantly more expensive than originally planned”."®> In August 2023, when Christopher
Brocklesby joined Post Office as its Chief Transformation Officer, he found “no credible plan to
deliver” by March 2025.'"

Fujitsu has been concerned about the significant delays to the NBIT programme for some time.
As set out in its Fifth Corporate Statement to the Inquiry, Fujitsu’s primary concern is that delays
to the rollout of NBIT will present significant challenges to the feasibility of the continued

delivery of the Horizon IT System and its associated services.'””

At the time of these Closing Submissions, Post Office and Fujitsu have agreed a 1-year extension
to the Horizon Contract. In its Fifth Corporate Statement, Fujitsu noted that “any extension to the
Horizon Contract should necessarily see the removal of the Court Case Support Services
provisions”. These provisions have now been removed from the Horizon Contract.'°* The DBT
and Post Office have requested that Fujitsu considers a longer extension, and that Fujitsu
continues to discuss with Post Office its requirements in this regard. Fujitsu’s position remains

that any extension carries significant risks. The Horizon IT System is on ‘End-of-Service-Life’

See, POL00448907, Post Office presentation, ‘Ad Hoc A&CI Board Report’, dated 1 August 2024 and the
evidence of Mr Bartlett and Ms Burton. Mr Bartlett’s evidence was that the Project Willow2 investigation is
“currently open and is being externally — by an external organisation, one of the law firms and accountancy
firms”: INQ00001198, Transcript, 17 October 2024, p.189, In.8-In.14 (Mr John Bartlett). Ms Burton’s
evidence was that Grant Thornton is investigating the allegations raised in the John Doe Report.
1NQ00001188, Transcript, 27 September 2024, p.49, In.14-p.51, In.6 (Ms Amanda Burton). Note, Mr
Brocklesby is also being investigated by an external investigator appointed by Post Office under the project
“Willow3”. It is alleged that during a briefing to the Post Office Board on alternatives to NBIT, Mr
Brocklesby (i) misrepresented a possible alternative offered by Escher, and (ii) the “true extent and
completeness of the bid/offer by Escher to POL was incorrectly discounted and suppressed as a viable
alternative without broader consideration” (POL00448907, p.8). Mr Brocklesby has denied the allegation.

IT infrastructure and, due to this status and its age, there is an increasing risk of the existing
Horizon IT System infrastructure failing, which could adversely impact the delivery of services
to the public. Since 2020, Fujitsu has consistently communicated its concerns to Post Office in

relation to supporting end of life infrastructure, and that it wishes to exit the Horizon Contract.!”

6.3 Fujitsu’s remediation efforts

99. The technical remediation undertaken by Fujitsu in respect of the Horizon IT System is
summarised in Fujitsu’s Fourth Corporate Statement.” In particular, Fujitsu has implemented a
range of technical remediation measures concerning: (i) the management of BEDs; (ii) controls
on the use of ‘privileged access’ (i.e. remote access); and (iii) measures to monitor compliance

with contractual obligations regarding incident management and privileged access.

100. Fujitsu’s cultural and governance remediation efforts are summarised in its Fifth Corporate
Statement.”"! Fujitsu frankly acknowledges that its work to learn lessons, and to change and
improve its business practices and culture, is ongoing. That is consistent with concessions made
by Mr Patterson in the course of his oral evidence to the Inquiry.” Fujitsu also candidly
acknowledges that, while it has not wanted to pre-empt the conclusions of this Inquiry, more by
way of reform and remediation could and should have been done sooner. Fujitsu is committed to

continuing its remediation activities following the conclusion of this Inquiry.
101. By way of summary in relation to Fujitsu’s cultural and governance remediation efforts:

101.1. Fujitsu has implemented a specific remediation scheme, the ‘Rebuilding Trust
Programme’, designed to implement a range of improvement initiatives in relation to: (i)

people; (ii) process and governance; and (iii) technology.

101.2. In 2023, Fujitsu engaged a business ethics consultancy (Ethisphere LLC) to assist Fujitsu
in better understanding how its ethical culture could be improved. Fujitsu has engaged
that consultancy to work to improve Fujitsu’s ethical culture and compliance over a 3-
year period. The consultancy has been engaged in practical work within Fujitsu,
including in providing workshops and training to all Fujitsu employees (and targeted

workshops to leadership and senior management).

199 See, for example, POL00448622, Post Office Board Report, ‘Belfast Data Centre Fortification’, dated 24
January 2023, p.1 (“the Fujitsu position since 2020 has consistently been that they wish to exit the Horizon
contract and that they harbour multiple concerns about supporting out of date hardware and software in the
Data Centres”).

53
SUBS0000067
SUBS0000067

101.3. Fujitsu has worked to embed a stronger whistleblowing culture within the organisation,
and has implemented practical measures to facilitate employees raising concerns, ideas,

and questions within the organisation.

101.4. Fujitsu has taken steps to ensure that its legal department is actively engaged in Fujitsu’s
cooperation with police forces in respect of criminal proceedings against SPMs. That
serves to ensure that any support provided by Fujitsu in relation to a criminal
investigation or prosecution is: (i) compliant with relevant legal duties; and (ii) consistent

with Fujitsu’s ethical culture and corporate values.

PART 7. Conclusion

102. At the core of this Inquiry are the SPMs and their families who were so profoundly and tragically
affected by these appalling miscarriages of justice. Fujitsu reiterates its sincere apology to the

SPMs and their families.

103. The Inquiry has conducted a thorough and searching investigation. The work of the Inquiry has
revealed the technical, human, and organisational failings which contributed to the suffering of
SPMs and their families. Fujitsu accepts its share of those failings as outlined in the following

paragraphs of these Closing Submissions: §§13, 17, 18, 19, 39, 43, 73.

104. Prior to the commencement of this Inquiry, the appalling miscarriages of justice that have now
been laid bare by this Inquiry were framed as resulting primarily or exclusively from /T issues.
The evidence revealed by the Inquiry has demonstrated that these miscarriages of justice were
not caused by technological failures exclusively, or even primarily, but are instead the product of

serious human and organisational failures in conduct, ethics, governance and culture.

105. Fujitsu hopes that, having supported the Inquiry through its work, it has gone some way to
demonstrating its commitment to learning lessons from the Inquiry process and to ensuring that

the mistakes of the past are never repeated.

ANNEX: Evidence as to Post Office’s knowledge of BEDs

1, The purpose of this Annex is to provide a convenient summary of some of the evidence as to
Post Office’s knowledge of BEDs. As the Inquiry will appreciate, there is extensive evidence to
support the conclusion that Post Office had knowledge of the potential for, and the existence of,

BEDs in the Horizon IT System. This Annex is necessarily a summary of that evidence.

2 Fujitsu has previously acknowledged that, throughout its period of operation, the Horizon IT
System was affected by BEDs, which had the potential to cause, and which did in fact cause,

discrepancies in Post Office branch accounts.

3. Onone level, that is unsurprising. As a number of witnesses acknowledged, in any large IT system
~— particularly one of the scale and complexity of the Horizon IT System — the existence of BEDs
is inevitable.”° That basic fact was well understood by those who interacted with the Horizon IT
System. However, contemporaneous knowledge of BEDs (within both Post Office and Fujitsu)

went well beyond acknowledgment of the mere theoretical possibility of BEDs.

4. The evidence before the Inquiry has consistently illustrated that Post Office had knowledge of
the potential for, and the existence of, BEDs in the Horizon IT System from the outset and
throughout the relevant period.“ Further, Post Office were aware of the potential for unknown
and unresolved BEDs to affect the Horizon IT System, and to impact upon branch accounts. Any
submission to the contrary, or any suggestion that Post Office may have been misled as to the
nature and extent of BEDs, is untenable in light of the totality of the evidence before the
Inquiry.*°> In addition, from an early stage, Post Office, including lawyers acting on its behalf,

were aware of categories of documents which evidenced BEDs (such as KELs, PinICLs, Peaks

and events).20°

203 See, for example, INQ00001196, Transcript, 15 October 2024, p.16 In.12-In.14 (Mr Michael Young) (Q.
“But you knew from your previous roles that all systems have bugs, errors and defects; is that right?” A.
“That * correct”), INQ00000988, Transcript, 24 February 2023, p.137, In.20-p.138, In.11 (Mr David Smith)
(Q. “Do you accept that any system as complex as Horizon was bound to have some level of bugs, errors
and defects?” A. “Absolutely, absolutely”); WITN10340100, First Witness Statement Arthur Leslie Owen,
dated 9 October 2024, §31 (“all /T systems have a level of BEDs and I do not recall being given any evidence
to suggest that the level of BEDS in Horizon was unusual’).

SUBS0000067

5. The sharing of information concerning BEDs between Fujitsu and Post Office was a routine part
of the business-as-usual operation of the Horizon IT System, and continued throughout its period
of operation. As set out at §§6-8 below, the evidence supports the conclusion that those systems
for sharing information regarding BEDs were generally effective in practice. Further, in order to
assist this Inquiry, Fujitsu has identified certain key milestones in respect of Post Office’s
knowledge of BEDs (see §9 below) and examples of Post Office’s awareness of certain categories
of documents that evidenced the existence of BEDs (see §§10-13 below). Fujitsu has also
identified and summarised evidence that key individuals within Post Office were aware of BEDs
(see §§14-22 below).

Business-as-usual information sharing regarding BEDs

6. The systems established for information sharing in respect of BEDs are set out in some detail in
Fujitsu’s closing submissions for Phase 3.7” Fujitsu reiterates that information concerning BEDs
was shared with Post Office as a routine part of the business-as-usual operation of the Horizon
IT System throughout its period of operation. That includes by way of: (i) various reports passing

between ICL Pathway / Fujitsu and Post Office throughout the relevant period in respect of

208 (

identified technical issues within the Horizon IT System;*”* (ii) various forums and channels of

communication between Fujitsu and Post Office, in the course of which BEDs and system

integrity issues were routinely discussed;?® (iii) the close working relationship between Post
Office and ICL Pathway / Fujitsu, which involved extensive ad hoc communications concerning
the identification of BEDs being shared between the organisations;?!” (iv) joint Fujitsu and Post
Office test teams;?!! (v) joint working documents which demonstrate Fujitsu’s and Post Office’s
mutual understanding regarding the existence of, and potential impacts of, BEDs (joint working
is also evident in the management of particular BEDs about which the Inquiry heard evidence in
Phase 3);7? and (vi) release management process, which was an important measure in the

management of BEDs.?!?

7. Fujitsu now also produces, (i) reports regarding issues identified in Peaks which have been tagged
as either ‘Live Defects’?'* or ‘HDR Defects’ ,'5 and (ii) a weekly ‘HDR Defects Update Report’,
which notes all identified issues which, among other things, have the ability to impact upon

branch accounts.”!°

8. The evidence therefore compels the conclusion that, in general, Fujitsu routinely and continually

shared information concerning the existence of, and impact, of BEDs with Post Office.

Post Office knowledge of BEDs: Key milestones

9. Throughout this Inquiry, Fujitsu has consistently advanced the position that Post Office had
institutional knowledge of the potential for, and existence of, BEDs in the Horizon IT System
prior to its rollout and throughout its period of operation. That timeline has both been borne out
by the evidence the Inquiry has heard and adopted by Counsel to the Inquiry when putting
questions to Post Office witnesses. *!” In the section which follows, Fujitsu has sought to identify
the key milestones in the development of Post Office’s knowledge of BEDs in the Horizon IT
System, and the direct link to their potential to impact upon branch accounts. It will be noted that
two of these milestones formed the basis of detailed case studies by Dame Sandra Dawson and
Dr Katy Stewart in Part 2 of their governance expert report.”'* These milestones are by no means

exhaustive.

9.1, July 1999: The evidence suggests that the existence of integrity issues related to balancing
were known within Post Office during the testing and rollout of the Horizon IT System.

A ‘HDR Defect’ is a subset of ‘Live Defects’, and is an issue which has the potential to affect (i) branch
financial outcomes; (ii) the way an end user of Horizon in-branch (such as an SPM) is required to use the
system; or (iii) the experience of a Post Office customer or client: FUJ00243314, Appendix, ‘Letter to the

See, for example, the question put to Adam Crozier by Mr Beer KC: “/...] as a result of the findings of a
series of court cases, it has been established that, within the period 2000 to 2010 [...] there were a series of
bugs, errors and defects in the Horizon system, of which the Post Office knew and which either caused or
were capable of causing financial irregularities and balancing problems?”, INQ00001129, Transcript, 12

by Post Office on 19 July 1999.7"? The problem was described as a data integrity issue
associated with imbalances in cash accounts. The Second Supplemental Agreement dated
24 September 1999 predicated acceptance on Fujitsw/ICL Pathway using reasonable

endeavours to resolve a series of BEDs, including A1376.7°

9.2. 2004: Post Office received expert analysis concluding that most errors which were logged
in respect of one Post Office branch could not be attributed to the relevant SPM. In the
course of civil proceedings brought against Mrs Julie Wolstenholme concerning alleged
‘shortfalls’ at the Cleveleys branch, Post Office jointly instructed IT expert Jason Coyne
to provide a report on the use of the Helpdesk at Cleveleys. Mr Coyne’s report, dated 21
January 2004, concluded that there was “clearly defective in elements of [the Horizon IT
System s] hardware, software or interfaces. The majority of the errors as noted in the fault
logs [in respect of Cleveleys] could not be attributed to being of Mrs Wolstenholme’
making or operation of the system”.”' The civil claim was then settled, and the evidence
suggests that it was a priority for Post Office to keep the adverse opinion expressed by Mr
Coyne about the Horizon IT System out of the public domain by entering into a

confidentiality agreement.”

9.3. January 2006: Post Office had knowledge of the existence of the Callendar Square bug.
The contemporaneous records show that Post Office was aware of the Callendar Square
bug, which created duplicate transactions, from early 2006. In December 2006, Post
Office lawyers discussed the Callendar Square bug, and how any issues arising at the
Callendar Square branch, or others impacted, could be distinguished from those arising in

Post Office’s civil case against Mr Lee Castleton in respect of the Marine Drive branch.?*

9.4. Mid-2006: Post Office was on notice of analysis by Fujitsu staff to the effect that technical
failings were normal occurrences in the Horizon IT System. The Inquiry has records of
track changes made by Graham Ward to a draft witness statement provided by Mr Jenkins
in support of the prosecution of Mr Hughie Noel Thomas. Mr Ward, a former Post Office
financial investigator, deleted references to “system failure” being one of “three main
reasons why a zero value transaction may be generated” on the Horizon IT System in

respect of Mr Thomas’ branch, and that such failures were “normal occurrences”.

9.5. Late 2006: In Post Office’s civil case against Mr Lee Castleton, independent experts BDO
Stoy Hayward wrote a letter to lawyer, Stephen Dilley of Bond Pearce (now Womble Bond
Dickinson), who was acting for Post Office noting, “we have found there is some indication
of possible problems with Horizon” and that “some problems may exist i.e. that the double
entry is not being put through”.?*° A draft report prepared by BDO a few months later also
raised the prospect of “possible computer problems” apparent from differences in the cash

account (albeit these were said to be small).”””

9.6. July 2010: In a meeting with the Defence expert, Professor McLachlan, in Post Office’s
prosecution of Mrs Seema Misra, Mr Jenkins informed Professor McLachlan that, (i)
Fujitsu recorded “all testing and Live faults in the same system” (a reference to the Peak
database), and (ii) there were “around 200,000” faults recorded.2°* Mr Jenkins’ note of this
meeting was circulated to at least John Longman and Mr Singh of Post Office, and Post
Office external counsel, Warwick Tatford, on 27 July 2010.2

9.7. September/October 2010: Post Office became aware of the Receipts and Payments
mismatch bug. Post Office was aware of this bug from at least September/October 2010,
when a joint meeting was held between Fujitsu and Post Office staff to discuss the bug
which caused discrepancies at Horizon counters.’ The minutes from that meeting record
concerns being expressed that, if the bug was widely known, it “could cause a loss of

confidence in the Horizon System by branches”, potentially “impact upon ongoing legal

ammunition to blame Horizon for future discrepancies”.*' A report concerning the bug
was sent to Post Office employees, including Post Office lawyer Mr Singh, in October
2010, just three days before Mrs Misra’s trial commenced.?” It was not disclosed in those
proceedings. The meeting minutes, if disclosed, would also have revealed the ability of

remote access powers to be used to correct branch accounts without an SPM being aware.

9.8. September 2011: The Post Office Board were put on notice by Post Office’s external
auditors at that time, Ernst & Young, that there were questions about whether the Horizon
IT System captured data accurately. Ms Perkins attended a meeting with Ernst & Young in
which the risks the Horizon IT System posed for the Post Office was raised. Ernst & Young
also drew Ms Perkins’ attention to the fact that there were questions as to whether the

Horizon IT System captured data accurately, noting that SPMs alleged to have engaged in

fraud had suggested that discrepancies were the result of a “systems problem”.?®

Post Office knowledge of BEDs: Documents evidencing BEDs
10. From an early stage, Post Office, including lawyers acting on its behalf, were aware of categories
of documents which evidenced BEDs (such as KELs, PinICLs, Peaks and events). By way of

example:

11. PinICL / Peak: PinICL was the customised incident logging and resolution tracking system
adopted for use by ICL Pathway to support the Horizon IT system during the period 1996 to
2003, when it was replaced by the Peak system.

11.1. The Resolution Plan for Acceptance Incident 298 dated 23 September 1999 and distributed
to both Post Office and ICL Pathway recipients, includes at section 5.5.1 a ‘PINICL
Analysis’, which considers the content of 133 PinICLs. As a result of this analysis, 50
PinICLs were identified as relating to faults in the Live Trial of Legacy Horizon. These 50
PinICLs were then categorised as faults relating to, (i) “Usability/Robustness”, of which
there were 38, (ii) “Stability/Performance, of which there were 5, and (iii) “Application

Logic” or “Plain software bugs”, of which there were 7.27

11.2. In August 2004, Jan Holmes of Fujitsu provided to lawyers acting for Post Office (Susanne

Helliwell, Weightmans Vizards solicitors)**

in the civil proceedings relating to the
Cleveleys branch a signed witness statement intended for use in that case.” In this witness
statement, Mr Holmes described the four lines of support provided by Fujitsu, referring
extensively to the PinICL system and how it linked both to the PowerHelp system used by

the helpdesk and the KEL database (as addressed in more detail below).

11.3. Former senior managers of Post Office’s technical teams, Jeremy Folkes and John
Meagher, knew of the existence of the PinICL system prior to the national rollout of Legacy
Horizon.” Further, during this time, the content of PinICLs was shared by ICL Pathway’s
PinICL Impact Assessment Team with members of Mr Meagher’s team and others at Post
Office, either via access to the PinICL database or printed copies of extracts from that

database.*!

12. Known Error Log / KELs: The “Known Error Log” was a knowledge management tool used
by both ICL Pathway and Fujitsu to explain how to deal with, or work around, issues that arose
in the Horizon IT System. Each entry in the Known Error Log was referred to as a “KEL”
(collectively, “KELs”). The term “Known Error Log” or “KEL” was replaced in around July
2019 by the term “Knowledge Base” or “KB”. As will be clear from the evidence summarised
below, any suggestion that there was some reluctance within Fujitsu to reveal the existence of the

KEL database or the records it contained is unfounded.

12.1. Inthe monthly Service Review Book dated 7 April 2000, which was circulated to both Post
Office and Fujitsu recipients, it is noted that the helpdesk and second line support teams
had become “over cautious” due to “a number of software issues, which have manifested
themselves as hardware failure”. This had led the support teams to “review all hardware

call symptoms against the 'Known Error Log' (KEL) before passing the call to Field

Engineering...” 2”

12.2. The existence of KELs was also referred to in at least the following witness statements
provided by Fujitsu employees in the context of Post Office proceedings against SPMs, (i)
the witness statement of Penny Thomas dated 17 June 2004 in respect of the Forest Gate

branch,” (ii) the witness statement of Mr Holmes dating from August 2004 in civil

proceedings relating to the Cleveleys branch,” (iii) the witness statement of William
Mitchell dated 7 March 2005 in respect of the Abbots Cross branch,” (iv) the witness
statements of Andy Dunks in respect of the Rugeley,2“° Bowburn,” and Torquay Road?
branches during April to June 2006, and (v) the witness statement of Mrs Chambers dated

14 September 2006 in civil proceedings relating to the Marine Drive branch.”

was the assessment they made based on the PinICL, whether the impact was such that needed to have a
software fix, or whether it could be handled in a work around... whether we were presented with printed
PinICLs or whether we had access to the system I’m not sure. I dont remember having direct access to the
PinICL system. I think we were consulted on PinICLs as they emerged”).

12.3. In the context of Post Office’s prosecution of Mrs Misra, it is clear that Mr Jenkins
discussed the existence of the Known Error Log with the Defence expert, Professor
McLachlan.?*° During his cross-examination at trial, Mr Jenkins was also asked questions

about and acknowledged the existence of the Known Error Log.?5!

13. Event Logs: Event logs are produced by Microsoft Windows NT, the operating system used on
post office branch counters.”*? These logs record “events”, which are “indications of conditions
that have operational significance” to the Horizon IT System, and include software, hardware or
security conditions that require investigation.? Microsoft Windows NT manages three logs for
security, system and application respectively, reporting on the operation of Windows, and other

applications in the Horizon IT System may also report into these logs.

13.1. On 24 January 2002, Mr Holmes produced a witness statement in respect of the
Camberwell Green branch.” In this statement, Mr Holmes provided a description of
Tivoli Event Logs and an analysis of the logs produced during the period being examined.
Mr Holmes notes in his second witness statement to the Inquiry that he does not know

what happened with his statement after it was produced.

13.2. Mr Holmes’ statement in the Camberwell Green case was later circulated by Mr Dilley of

Bond Pearce in the context of Post Office’s civil case against Mr Castleton.”**

13.3. During Mr Castleton’s trial in January 2007, Mrs Chambers discussed the existence of
event logs and her consideration of them during her investigation of issues at the Marine
Drive branch. It appears in the context of Mr Castleton’s case that event logs were
provided by Fujitsu to Post Office, but these logs were not subsequently disclosed by Post
Office to Mr Castleton.?*”

Post Office knowledge of BEDs: Key individuals
14. The evidence supports the conclusion that information about the potential for, and existence of,
BEDs in the Horizon IT System was shared with and available to: (i) individuals across a range

of teams within Post Office; (ii) individuals of varying levels of seniority within Post Office (up

to, and including, senior executives within Post Office); (iii) relevant individuals engaged as

external advisors to Post Office; (iv) individuals and organisations involved in relevant

‘Siloing’ of information regarding BEDs

23. Notwithstanding that information concerning BEDs was widely known within Post Office, it
would also be open to the Inquiry to conclude that organisational silos within Post Office
contributed to a failure by certain staff within Post Office to consider that BEDs in the Horizon
IT System were capable of producing transaction errors and impacting upon branch accounts.
That is, there was a routine failure by Post Office staff (particularly in relation to the
investigations team) to share internally important information concerning integrity issues
identified in the Horizon IT System with their colleagues.’ That was a critical missed

opportunity.

24. The Inquiry heard consistent evidence from present and former Post Office employees that there
was a ‘message from the top’ that the Horizon IT System was ‘robust’. That ‘message from the
top’ was obviously contrary to the extensive material available to Post Office which demonstrated

the existence of BEDs in the Horizon IT System. Nonetheless, that message was pervasive:

problems were suggested in Harry Bowyer s Response to the Interim Review of Cartwright Kings Current
Process by Brian Altman QC [POL00066807_0002] but, as I understood it, these were in Horizon Online,

round those messages [i.e. complaints regarding the integrity of Horizon] from

postmasters. So to be able to challenge them”.* The evidence of Jane Smith was that “in
or around 2011... there was a communication to NBSC helpline and P&BA staff which

said that when a postmaster called the NBSC helpline to raise an issue with Horizon, staff

should not use the phrase ‘system issue’ when speaking about Horizon” 3°

24.3. Further, it is clear this ‘message from the top’ that the Horizon IT System was ‘robust’ was
communicated to Post Office’s external legal advisors. The Inquiry heard evidence from a
number of Post Office’s external legal advisors, who suggested that they had been provided
assurances by Post Office that the Horizon IT System was ‘robust’. Those witnesses
included: Stephen Dilley,** Richard Morgan KC,*** Martin Smith, and Warwick
Tatford.>”

25. To the extent that some Post Office employees sought to suggest that the ‘message from the top”
originated with Fujitsu,>”' that evidence is of doubtful reliability and should be rejected. That is

because:

25.1. The consistent evidence from Post Office employees involved in criminal investigations
and prosecutions was that they had only very limited personal or direct interactions with
Fujitsu staff.2” Indeed, a curious feature of the evidence on this issue is that a number of
Post Office witnesses who sought to cast blame upon Fujitsu for the ‘message from the

top’, also gave evidence that they had limited (if any) personal or direct interactions with

25.2. Anumber of the Post Office employees who suggested that such a message had come from
‘Fujitsu’ were entirely vague in their recollection as to the circumstances of such an
assurance, or the terms on which it was given.*”° There is, moreover, no contemporaneous

documentation of which Fujitsu is aware to support those suggestions.

25.3. Indeed, where there is available evidence of the information being provided by Fujitsu
directly to those engaged in the investigation and criminal investigation of SPMs, the
suggestion that Fujitsu was providing fulsome assurances as to the integrity of the system
did not bear scrutiny. By way of illustration, although Mr Singh sought to suggest that
relevant assurances had been provided by Mr Jenkins, there are contemporaneous email
records of Mr Singh being aware that Mr Jenkins had explained that he was “not currently
in a position to make a clear statement” that the system was functioning properly, because
