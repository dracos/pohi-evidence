REGINA
-V-

ALISON HENDERSON

FACTUAL BASIS/APPLICATION FOR “GOODYEAR”
INDICATION

1.) The defendant hereby instructs her counsel to seek a “Goodyear”
indication.

2.) The defendant maintains her denial of theft, but would be pleading
guilty to false accounting.

3.) The defendant was sub-post mistress of Worstead sub-Post Office.

4.) Her guilty pleas to false accounting would be accepted on the
basis that she became aware of a discrepancy in the accounts, but
dishonestly covered it up by entering false figures in the sub-Post
Office accounts, thereby causing loss to Post Office Ltd., who
were kept unaware of the discrepancy.

5.) The amount of discrepancy is £11,957-78.

6.) Though maintaining her denials of theft, the defendant accepted
that she is contractually obliged to pay the entire sum to Post
Office Ltd. and has already done so from her family savings.

7.) The defendant is 51 years old and of previous good character.
