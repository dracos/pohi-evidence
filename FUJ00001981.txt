4.0 FUJITSU SERVICES HELPDESK SERVICES FOR
THE POST OFFICE

4.1 Introduction

The services provided by Fujitsu Services changed during the autumn of 2002 with the
introduction of SPOC2 and Universal Banking.

A Single Point of Contact for all telephone calls from Post Masters, about Post Offices
services, including the POA solution, is fully operational. Telephone calls are now
taken via the NBSC Single Point of Contact with a voice driven menu system where
callers are directed to choose the option for the Horizon Service Desk for specific
issues,

This plan covers the following team providing technical services:

- Horizon Service Desk

HSD is operational Monday to Saturday from 08:00 to 18:30.
Notes:

An Incident Management Team also resides within the Horizon Service Desk function.

Please refer to the Systems Management section of the Horizon Support Service
Continuity Plan (REF3) for details on the reporting of Out Of Hours incidents, e.g. for
operational issues at Post Office Limited or AP client sites.

Much of the infrastructure, e.g. Phoenix, is common to the HSD, UKME and SMC
teams as an incident management system and by POA as a Problem Management
system these services are provided from a shared location at either STEO9 or SDCO1.

4.1.1 Horizon Service Desk (HSD)

All calls are taken in STEO9. The HSD service is provided out of normal HSD hours
only by the use of a voicemail service.

The HSD provides the following services:

e Support for the following callers:
e Authorised Post Office (Outlet) Staff
¢ Authorised Post Office Limited Staff

e All other authorised users as stated in the Call Enquiry Matrix
DSP/HQ/OPS/001

¢ Incident logging and all diagnosis for callers entitled to use the Horizon Service
Desk

FUJ00001981
Fujitsu Services Horizon Service Desk Ref: CS/PLA/015
Business Continuity Plan Version: 8.0
COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 30-Jan-2006

¢ Call resolution or routing in line with contractual measures.

© Central point for information on the working state of the overall infrastructure
(calls may be passed to the SMC depending on the information required).

© Responsibility for the overall management of the call from inception to resolution
with regard to ensuring overall call progression is in line with contractual SLT’s.

e Escalation of incidents where they are likely to breach their individual SLT or
constitute a possible or actual business risk.

e Responsibility for analysing and escalating received incidents and for providing
information on SLT conformance, incident trends and call-handling timescales.

The Incident Management Team is a team within the HSD who deal primarily with
SLA monitoring, Trend Analysis, Escalations process, Major Incidents, Customer
Complaints, Daily Hardware and network call-backs.

The IMT is broken down into two areas; those who deal solely with the daily hardware
and network call back reports and those that deal with all other aspects of the role.

HSD uses the secure POA network to gain access to the TIVOLI management system
which is in STEO9.

4.2 Common Infrastructure

4.2.1 Voice Systems Features

With the introduction of the Single Point of Contact all calls into the Horizon Service
Desk are routed via a single number operated by BT. This service has been stated to
provide 100% resilience for call delivery into the HSD, and therefore Fujitsu Services
has not provided any additional resilience in order to operate using this service. The
invocation process for changing operational call plans has been modified to reflect the
source of call delivery (being via Post Office Limited during normal operational hours
and via BT at other times).

The HSD is located at a single site in Stevenage (STE09).

The STEO9 HSD site has a target ISDN30 bearer receiving Post Office Limited calls
via BT Command Link. The STE09 bearer is supported by two ISDN30 bearers, one
of which has 15 live and 15 spare channels. Calls are automatically cascaded to the
supporting bearers when the target bearer is busy.

In the event that the HSD site in STEO9 is rendered inoperable (e.g. building
evacuation), then calls can be either re-directed to a voicemail service, or redistributed
to the HSD disaster recovery site in STE14, using BT remote divert and Command
Link. If this cannot be handled automatically by the Network ACD or BT re-routing,
then the ‘remote divert’ will be used to manually re-route calls within the BT network.

FUJ00001981
Fujitsu Services Horizon Service Desk Ref: CS/PLA/015
Business Continuity Plan Version: 8.0
COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 30-Jan-2006

All calls diverted to the HSD disaster recovery site are directed to a direct dial number
on the STE14 Private Automatic Branch Exchange (PABX).

Remote diverts can be activated, by approved managers, via the Post Office Limited
NBSC. This may need to be used in conjunction with the temporary transference of
reinforcement staff from the inoperable centre to a DR site.

4.2.2 IT Systems

A Phoenix database server, one Phoenix application server and one Phoenix Web
server are all located at the STEO9 HSD location. Standby Phoenix database,
application and Web servers are also located in the Southern Data Centre in SDCO1
The preferred working model is to run all three Phoenix Servers ‘local’ from the same
site in order gain optimal performance from the system. However, an additional level
of contingency has been introduced for such scenarios as hardware failures at both
sites. E.g. A failure of the STEO9 application server coupled with and a failure of the
SDCO1 web server could now potentially result in a continued service, e.g., by running
the web server from STE09 and the application server from SDCO1.

4.2.3 Power

To provide contingency against mains power failure, the HSD Phoenix Database
servers, Application servers and Web servers, and the HSD telephone communications
equipment in STEO9 and SDCO1 are protected by Un-interruptible Power Supplies. A
standby generator is in place in STEO9 and there are standby generators for the SDCO1
Data centre. In the event of power loss at either of these locations it is expected that
continuous power is provided, initially by the Un-interruptible Power Supplies and
then by the generators.

5.0 Testing Strategy
5.1 Initial Testing

The initial testing of all business continuity contingency plans is documented in the
Business Continuity Test Plan (REF4). For details of the test objectives for the
Horizon Service Desk and services and for an overview of the test, see test 10 in this
reference.

5.2 Ongoing Test Strategy

This refers to how the contingency measures in place for the Horizon Service Desk
(HSD) services will be periodically tested to ensure they are current and reflect the
service model as the services matures.

This will be provided by an ongoing series of business continuity tests at a
predetermined frequency for the duration of the Fujitsu Services POA contract. The
nature of these tests is reflected in the Business Continuity Test Plan (REF4).

Business Continuity Plan Version: 8.0
COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 30-Jan-2006

6.0 Preventative Measures

It is a fundamental philosophy of the POA solution that wherever technically possible,
all components of the service are designed in such a way as to ensure maximum
resilience to failure by way of eliminating all possible single points of failure. i.e. to
cover both performance and resilience by providing multiple platforms, performing
similar functionality.

This concept is extended to the provision of the Horizon Service Desk , thus allowing
the helpdesk service to be delivered in part, or indeed in total, from one or more
helpdesk sites (including Disaster Recovery sites) should the need arise.

7.0 Preparedness Measures

Preparedness in the Horizon context is defined as those measures taken to ensure the
technical solution and business processes supporting that solution deliver the service
that they are designed to deliver in such a way as to meet and exceed the service level.

7.1 Service Management & Delivery

From a business perspective, this process starts by establishing very exacting and
specific service level agreements with all suppliers to the Horizon Service, which are
constantly monitored and reviewed.

The provision of operational documentation for all aspects of service delivery is
mandated and allows POA to ensure that the service is being delivered in a consistent
way that satisfies not only service level requirements but also the quality model.

7.2 Risk Analysis

Section 10 contains a risk analysis of the Horizon Service Desk service provision. This
is supported by a more detailed risk analysis managed by the FSCS Horizon Service
Desk.

This identifies potential risks to the services, the assessed probability of that risk
occurring, the impact of that risk becoming a reality and the contingency activity or
plans necessary to contain such an occurrence with minimum impact to the service.

Fujitsu Services Horizon Service Desk Ref: CS/PLA/015
Business Continuity Plan Version: 8.0
COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 30-Jan-2006

8.0 Contingency Measures

Contingency measures are defined as the actions to be performed in the event of a
service break to enable business impact to be minimised during the service outage prior
to recovery being completed.

Contingency measures will include the recognition, activation, incident management
and initiation of recovery procedures.

8.1 Recognition

The Horizon solution includes a Systems Management capability to monitor and report
on events that occur upon the infrastructure platforms involved in the Horizon service
delivery.

Most events that could lead to a break in the HSD service will be recognised by,
operational staff detecting a loss of infrastructure (such as power, phones etc), or
through observation by one of the support groups using system monitoring equipment.

In addition major hardware components (network links and servers) are remotely
monitored and faults can be reported by the monitoring services.

8.2 Activation

Once an event has occurred that will impact the provision of the HSD, a service call
will be raised with the most appropriate support unit via a call to the internal Fujitsu
Services helpdesk service (7799), or direct to the support unit.

8.3 Incident Management

In the event of a major incident the HSD Duty Manager will take command and follow
HSD procedures (REF 10) to implement appropriate actions.

If the incident cannot be resolved by the HSD at the time of the call it will be routed to
the appropriate support unit for resolution. At the same time if the incident meets the
HSD escalation criteria, it will be escalated to the appropriate Fujitsu Services POA

CS Service Delivery Manager or Duty Manager. The POA CS Service Delivery
Manager or Duty Manager will use the POA Incident Management Process (REF6) to
decide if a problem exists.

If the criteria for Cross-Domain Business Continuity Management are satisfied the
POA Duty Manager will escalate the incident to the Fujitsu Services POA Business
Continuity Manager as a Business Continuity incident.

Note: Post Office Limited may also escalate Business Continuity incidents directly to
the POA Duty Manager.
8.4 Initiation of recovery procedures

Where this is a POA only problem, recovery would usually be instigated by the support
team charged with supporting the equipment upon which the failure has occurred, as

FUJ00001981
Fujitsu Services Horizon Service Desk Ref: CS/PLA/015
Business Continuity Plan Version: 8.0
COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 30-Jan-2006

soon as possible, and certainly with intent to resolve the problem within the relevant
Service Level Target.

Depending on the severity of the problem, there may be some dialogue between the
POA Duty/Problem Manager and the support function to agree on the most
appropriate course of action.

Where there is a Cross-Domain problem, the resolution would be instigated at the time
when all parties affected had agreed the course of action.

In the case of a Business Continuity incident, this would be after the Business
Continuity Team had agreed a plan of action, see section 11 Plan Activation.

9.0 Recovery of Normal Service

All aspects of the HSD service infrastructure within POA are managed operationally
by FSCS. As such, the process of recovering from an event causing an impact to the
service will by definition involve FSCS, and or other support services within Fujitsu
Services, in performing an operational activity to resume the full service.

FSCS have prepared operational procedures that are referenced from the index
(REF8). The procedures either document the recovery activities from all possible
failures in the end to end service or reference related operational documents used by
Fujitsu Services.

For simple problems, normal service could be resumed without the need to notify the
POA CS Service Delivery Manager or Duty Manager, for more involved problems the
Duty or Problem Manager would liase with the support teams, agreeing when the
recovery action should be run, and then carrying out that activity.

10.0 Impact & Risk Assessment

The table below summarises the identified risks to the provision of the HSD services.

As a matter of normal operational practice, a call would be placed against HSD (or
other Fujitsu Services support unit) if any of the identified risks materialised.

The intention is that the list identified can act as a guide to personnel assessing and
managing any significant incident affecting the HSD.

The table within section 10.1 contains a column identified as probability with a range
of 0 to 4. These estimate the probable risk of failure. It must be emphasised that these
are not percentages and should be considered simple weighting factors.

As a guideline the following occurrence ratings have been allocated:

Rating
0 Less than one incident is predicted per year

1 One incident is predicted per year

2 Two incidents are predicted per year

3 Approximately three incidents are predicted per year

4 Ensure that appropriate contingency measures are taken e.g. duplicate

routing or the holding of spares on site.

The probability of complete failure of major elements of the service is low because:

There has been a high level of resilience and duplication built into the
infrastructure.

2, Extensive validation has been performed upon the infrastructure.

FSCS HSD Service Management and the Fujitsu Services POA project team
have developed a vast knowledge of component failure and service availability
over the life of the service.

10.2 Summary of Contingency Actions

10.2.1 BT Telephone Call Delivery System, via IVR (NBSC), to HSD.

There is no contingency action to be performed by HSD over and above normal operational incident
processes and the actions identified within the above risk tables. This is a BT supplied service.

10.2.2 Loss of Functionality in STE09 for HSD

If STEO9 is unavailable for use by HSD provision has been made for staff to re-locate to facilities in
STE14, another Fujitsu Services site in Stevenage. In addition a provision has been made to allow
phone contact to be re-established once staff have relocated, via a BT command switch. During any
period when no HSD is available to take calls, the calls will be directed to the voicemail service.
Once staff are operational at the alternate location the voicemail calls will be processed and the
callers will be called back. Selected staff would relocate to BRAO1 to access Tivoli based
functionality.

10.2.3 People

Human Resource Management processes are in place to manage the normal turnover of staff.

10.2.4 Manual Processes due to total loss of Phoenix

In the event that the Phoenix servers have failed at both STEO9 and SDCO1, or are inaccessible,
manual processes will be used to log calls until such time as Phoenix can be returned to service.
10.2.5 Loss Of access to Tivoli

In the event of the unavailability of Tivoli at STEO9 for an extended period of time (at least 2 hours)
then temporary relocation to BRAO! shall be considered.

11.0 Plan Activation

Once the criteria for Business Continuity involvement has been satisfied, i.e. an MBCI Trigger from
the table of risks above (section10), and after a call has been placed, and appropriate details logged
with the HSD (where possible), the problem ownership is passed to the POA member of the
Business Continuity Management team.

After compiling all relevant information, and if necessary communicating this to the other members
of the BCMT listed below (section 12), a full impact assessment will be conducted to determine if
the Fujitsu Services POA Business Continuity Management Process (REF7) will be invoked. This
will be done in conjunction with Senior Managers, relevant Business Units, and Expert Domains, as
appropriate

If the Joint BCM processes are invoked, the next step will be to agree whom from the BCMT owns
the MBCI.

The BCMT will then agree a plan of action and agree upon the recovery and contingency activities
to be carried out. The planning will be done in conjunction with Senior Managers, relevant Business
Units, and Expert Domains, as appropriate.

The agreed plan will then be monitored and reviewed until such time as the MBCI impacting the
affected service has been resolved, and the MBCI closed.

Refer to REF 18 for full details of the Fujitsu Services POA Business Continuity Management
Process.
