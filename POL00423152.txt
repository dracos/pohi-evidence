Executive Summary: Overview

Objectives &
approach

Whilst the POL Compliance Team provide a focus for regulated products, this does not extend to other aspects of legislative and regulatory obligations
‘The Group Compliance Director and Post Office Limited (POL) Head of Compliance have voiced concems regarding the adequacy of the control
environment across the range of legislation and regulation that impscls on POL. In addition, the strategic risk profile developed by the POL Executive
‘Team identifies failure to comply with our statutory and regulatory obligations as an area of risk

‘The overall objective isto provide an assessment of the risk that POL does not comply with its statutory or reguatory obligations and provide tools to
‘support the business unit in the ongoing assessment, monitoring and management of tis risk Specific objectives are to: identify the key gross risk
exposures; faciliate an assessment of control effectiveness around the most significant exposures; and provide an overall net assessment of risks and
deni priorities for improving the application ofa compliance framework in POL.

‘The approach identified all areas of legislation and regulation that impact on POL and, through consultation with Legal Services and the Head of
Compliance, produced from this @ list of key areas for POL, excluding areas managed entirely at Group level. Nominated members of the Executive
‘Team and Senior Leadership Population were asked fo self-asses controls in these areas using a queslonnatre previously developed and used al Group.
level, but modified for POL as agreed with the Head of Compliance. The sell-assessment was compared with information provided by Legal Services.

[AREA CONTROL ENVIRONMENT: there is @ MEDIUM risk of POL breaching its statutory and regulatory obligations,
RISK TO GROUP: LOW. There are no significant risks that have a Group impact.

Control Environment. Managing the impact of legislation on POL is complex with polices mostly, but not exclusively, owned al Group level and
responsibly for deployment in POL often spread across diferent functions, POL is embraced by the Royal Mall Group Compliance Framework, which is
specifically focused on RM Licence Conditions end Competition Law. However, given the wider trend towards an increasing regulatory burden, the
breadth of legislation impacting on POL and the complexity of the control environment required to manage its compliance, it would be appropriate for
POL to develop its own compliance framework. We have provided an outline of such a framework that sets out accountabilities, controls and governance
processes to deliver an adequate control envtronment across the range of legislation and reguation. Specific matters on which controls are sell-
‘assessed generally 2s insufcient, and which would be improved by incorporating them into a compliance framework, are compliance monitoring and
slaff awareness and understanding of thelr responsibil,

Controls Self-Assessment Perception Gap. The self-assessment of controls to enable compliance suggest a high level of contr. However, in many
‘areas of legislation the Legal Services’ view, based on judicial reviews, Itigation history, compensation claims and dialogue with regulators, suggests that
the self-assessments, iaken as 2 whole, are not fully relable. This ‘perception gap” may itself create a risk ii leads to failure to lake acon when it
\would appropriate to do so. An adjusted risk profile that reflects apparent gaps in perception of controls and also Legal Services’ assessment of the
degree of regulatory scrutiny shows, overall, a higher level of risk compared with that derived from self-assessment

‘Specific Aspects of Legislation. The principle areas of lepisation or regulation where the risk of non-compliance s highest ar:
+ Personal dala protection where POL products are being transacted by third party suppliers such as POFS;
+ Public Procurement Legislation, reflecting the newness of control measures implemented and concerns about overall levels of awareness.

Salfessessments are not available for a number of areas, wo of which warrant particular attention: Competiion Law, breach of which coud have
severe financial impact and copyrights and trademarks legislation, which offer opportunites to protect POL's intellectual property assets,
