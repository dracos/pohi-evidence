Reconciliation Date is the date attributed to a transaction to
allow Post Office Ltd. to reconcile. It will be set the first available
Bank Settlement date from the transaction elements (C112, C12,
C4, S & D) that make up a Network Banking transaction. If no
Bank Settlement date is available, the Reconciliation Date will be
set to the processing date that the Data Reconciliation Service first
recorded any element of the transaction being received. If a
Settlement date subsequently becomes available, the first available
Bank Settlement date will replace the processing date. However,
once a transaction has been accounted for on the reconciliation
reports, the Reconciliation Date will never change.

Routing Gateway Identifies a system, where the authorisation for a specific
transaction should be sought.

Run Date This is the System Processing Date for which the report refers, i.e.
all transaction components processed by the DRS on System
Processing Date dd/mm/yyyy are accounted for on this report.

Settlement Date Settlement Date is often the same as Run Date but some Financial
Institutions may assign a Settlement Date in the future: e.g. the
following Monday may be set on transactions processed on the
preceding Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

compiled to specify all Fujitsu Services outputs from the Data
RS) to enable a generic end to end reconciliation of Network
processing.

This document defines the format and content of all reconciliation reports for S80

Impact (post migration), which satisfies the Network Banking reconciliation

requirement including NBS, DCS and ETS. It does not attempt to define within the

operating systems how the transactions are processed.

The following Network Banking requirements are satisfied by this document:

© Reconciliation: [NBR0040], [NBR0042], [NBR0183], [NBR0212], [NBR0227],
[NBR0229], [NBR0278], [NBR0294], [NBR0389].

Settlement: [NBR0230], [NBR0456].

e Error Resolution: [NBR0260]

It is assumed that each of the Post Office Ltd. clients, as dictated by Routing Gateway
(assumed to be at this point the Banks / LINK) will require a separate reconciliation

report set.

Within this report set, separate reports will be provided as per the following table:

Report Number Deposit Transactions [Withdrawal Transactions
NBIOL Combined Report
NB102 Combined Report

NBO000 is a combined report for all Routing Gateways.

The format and content of each client’s report is considered to be identical when
allowing for these specific requirements. It should therefore be understood that the
specifications documented here are applicable to each client report set (specific client
requirements outside of this reporting specification are not covered within this
document)

There must be a separate set of reports to provide for transactions for which the
Routing Gateway and/or Transaction Type is not known.

Balance Enquiries and PIN changes are explicitly excluded from the report set as “Not
Required by Post Office Ltd.’

No report will mix currency, so if ever the transactions selected to appear on a set of
reports are not of a single currency, then a separate set of reports will be produced for

Report title — including the client name (derived from Routing Gateway.)
Transaction Type — (if applicable)

Report ‘Run Date’ - i.c., the period for which the report refers
Production date and time

Fujitsu Services report number

Fujitsu Services reference

3. Where ‘Received’ and ‘Reconciliation Date’ are quoted against time parameters:

e ‘Received = New’: defines transactions that have had a change of state since
they were last reported, or have never been reported, except in NB102 section
6

e ‘Received = Old’: defines transactions that have NOT had a change of state
since they were last reported

4. Reports: NB000, NB101 and NB102 will be produced DAILY. They will be

Section 12: Cleared Future Dated Transactions by Client

Liability _issues_are_not_covered_ within this document, nor_are_ the business
processes involved in the resolution of any exception.

NB102: Rules

NB102 is run daily

NB102 is repeated for each Routing Gateway.

For each report section, the column ‘Values’ will be partitioned into 8 sub columns
to contain the values for: ‘C12’, ‘S’, ‘C4’, ‘C112’ & the four values from a ‘D’
which are: Amount Requested, Amount Authorised, Amount Confirmed, Amount
Discrepancy. The reports will populate all values that are available.

For reporting purposes, within NB102 sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 & 11, the
column headed “CAP” will be blank.

For reporting purposes within NB102 sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, the column
headed ‘Discrepancy Type’ will report the “D’ discrepancy type.

Where no ‘D’ transaction element has been received, the ‘Discrepancy Type’ will
be blank

Where an exception is set to F99 by Fujitsu Services , clearance of this exception
within the appropriate NB102 section, (e.g. section 2 exceptions shown as cleared
within section 8), will always refer to the previously reported state regardless of
any change of state which may have occurred within the DRS.

All Uncleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & POL FS exceptions are reported as
summary totals by exception type - (NB102 section 1)

Uncleared Exceptioned Client Transactions are listed individually - (NB102
section 2)

18. Cleared Future Dated Transactions are reported as summary totals by Client
identified by Routing Gateway — (NB102 Section 12)

19. Within each section, exception summary totals / individual transactions are to be
grouped and sub totalled by reconciliation date with a total provided for the entire
section.

20. For reporting purposes:
¢ Timing Differences: relate to differences in the reconciliation date / settlement

date allocated where a settlement date on a transaction element is not the same
as the reconciliation date first reported on that transaction.

e Future Dated Transactions: relate to those transactions that have a
Reconciliation Date ahead of the Run Date of the report. For example, most
Clients will settle Friday, Saturday and Sunday transactions on the following
Monday. This means that each transaction completed on these days will have a
Reconciliation Date ahead of the Run Date of the report. These transactions
are expected to clear naturally once the Reconciliation Date and the Run Date
are in sync, however in the rare eventuality that a Reconciliation Date is
considerably ahead of the Run Date, Post Office Ltd. may wish to clear the
exception manually. In this case, Fujitsu Services will set the transaction to
‘F99".

21. For reporting purposes, within NB102 sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11 the
column headed ‘Transaction Type’ will be populated by the following codes:

03 - Withdrawal; Magstripe & PIN Verification (NBS)

04 - Withdrawal with balance; Magstripe & PIN Verification (NBS)

05 - Withdraw Limit; Magstripe & PIN Verification (NBS)

13 - Withdrawal; Signature Verification (NBS)
