Amy,

There is no list of those KELs that were deleted beyond retrieval, i.e. those in category 2.a) in the email below, therefore the
existence of such a KEL can only be surmised by it being referenced elsewhere (that is, on the assumption that any such reference
has been typed correctly.)

Hi Matthew
Do you know how many KELs would fall within the category: "Deleted KELs that are no longer retrievable"?
Many thanks

Please see my comments below. No need for apologies, I think I have now made it clearer below (including to myself).

Subjer Peaks / Kels which have not been disclosed but referred to by Coyne [WBDUK-AC.FID27032497]

HI Matthew

Apologies, if you have explained these points before but please could I clarify a couple of queries on the Known Error Log:

1. PinlCL system - it is correct that the PinICL entries are stored on an access database which is accessible?[Matthew
Lenton] There are two Access databases that contain some details of archived PinICLs, but they were created
some years ago by someone who has been retired for several years, and our understanding is that they appear to
be incomplete both in terms of a) not containing all of the original information that was stored against those
PinICL details that they do contain, and b) not containing between them all of the PinICLs that existed. We are
not sure of the criteria that was used for selecting the PinICLs to be archived. We have provided details of some
PinICLs, but for the reasons given above, we don’t believe that it is necessarily reliable.

2. Deleted KELs - are not retrievable? Or were provided to us on 5 November 2018 (see attached email chain — email on 12
Dec @ 16:30)?
[Matthew Lenton] There are two categories of Deleted:

a) Deleted KELs that are no longer retrievable due to being completely deleted, before SSC started saving them into
a “Deleted table”. These cannot be provided, and if a KEL is referred to by us as not being retrievable, and, I
believe, all KELs that are referred to in Coyne’s report as not having been disclosed, then they fall into this
category.

b) Deleted KELs that are retrievable due to being deleted into a “Deleted table”. These would no longer be included
in any SSC searches, even by changing the default search criteria as described in 3 below. We believe that the
functionality to save a deleted KEL was introduced in July 2008; however, the dates of KELs within the deleted
table are based on when the KEL was created, rather than when it was deleted, so it is not completely clear
when the change occurred (and noting that there could be retrievable KELs in that table which we have provided
that are older than KELs that are not retrievable, due to when they were deleted). This is the set we provided in
November.

3. Deactivated KELs — these were provided to us in the extract in March 2018, or on 5 November 2018?[Matthew Lenton]
These are KELs that have not been deleted into the “Deleted table” but are excluded from SSC’s default searches,
which focus on Live KELs, but can be included easily by changing search criteria. These were provided in the
original set in March.

4. Deprecated KEL - these were provided to us in the extract in March 2018, or on 5 November 2018?/Matthew Lenton]
When a KEL is updated, the old version of that same KEL is deprecated, so these are superseded versions of live
or deactivated KELs. We have only provided the most recent versions, so we have not separately provided these
superseded versions. Note that there are no deprecated versions of KELs in the category 2a) — i.e. if a KEL was
deleted prior to the introduction of the Deleted table function then all versions were deleted.

5. Live KELs — these were provided to us in March 18 and December 18.[Matthew Lenton] These were provided in March,
with those in category 3 above.

6. Other KELs — are there are other types of KELs which do not fall within the above catergories?[Matthew Lenton] No, the
above categories 2 to 5 cover all KELs.

Lucy,

We've located an archive of PinICL entries which contains some of the calls you listed, though not all, as annotated on the list in
your email below, noting that I have also added in the references that you asked about on 31-Jan-2019, and the archived records
for those are attached. The archiving was done some years ago as an export to Access, and this Excel extract is identical in format
to the Access records, so clearly any original formatting from the PinICL system has been lost.

Dates for the PinICLs that I have supplied are on the sheet, for those we don’t have we have no other information regarding dates
other than what is suggested in the report.

The KELs listed below are all deleted rather than deprecated or archived, and are therefore not retrievable.

Matthew,

Jason Coyne has referred to a number of Peaks / KELs in his supplemental report that he states have not been disclosed. Can you
let me know why they are not in the PEAK / KEL extracts we have received from you? Is it because they were all from the system
"PinICL"? If you can provide any dates relating to them that would be appreciated.
