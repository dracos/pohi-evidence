Subject: RE: Update from James

Good morning Alwen,

Further to this, James has asked me to go ahead and set this up. I think a phone call is going to be easier
for them both. James is about to ask Ian and Ron for a meeting on 2 July as a heads-up n the interim
report to be delivered on 8 July. I don’t know if and when Paul is expecting news from them about their
findings, but it makes sense for James and Paul to talk AFTER James has been given some warning about
what the interim report will contain.

Do any of the following suit Paula?
e Wednesday 3 July - anytime between 9 — 10.30am, or after 5pm on
e Thursday 4 July — after 3.30pm
e Friday is possible, but if we could try for earlier, it would be better from this end

Furthermore, James is starting to talk to the media. He has scheduled phone calls with Private Eye and
Computer Weekly which will simply be to let them know about the interim report and its presentation on 8
July. Media will not be invited to the meeting.

Let me know what you think.

Kind regards
Janet

Janet
Paula does not mind face to face or a call, although a call may be easier to organise for both of them

Have a great weekend

Thanks Alwen,

There won't be a problem regarding getting Paula and James together. I’Il start looking in the diary for a slot. Would
Paula prefer meeting or phone call?

Kind regards

Thanks Janet this is very helpful.

I will get Paula’s view on attending the meeting on our attending the meeting on the 8". Did you manage to get
James’ view on a Paula/James meeting or call before the 8" as we discussed.

Thanks

Subject: Update from James

Dear Alwen,

1. Alan Bates
Interim report - James had an extremely good telephone conversation with Alan Bates today. He has asked
me to let you know that Alan was content with the proposed content of the interim report. Alan was more
concerned with what happens after this has been delivered (which is due at a meeting to take place at
Westminster on 8 July, with Ian and Ron presenting). James touched on the point Paula has made about
potentially bringing the investigation of further cases in-house within the Post Office. Alan said he was not
entirely comfortable with this, but James persuaded him to put this matter into abeyance for the time being,
and Alan agreed. We can return to this after the interim report when we have all seen what it has to say.

Media — James also discussed media with him. We are beginning to be approached and are putting people

on hold — Private Eye, Computer Weekly, BBC Shropshire local radio. Alan said he was not responsible for
the article in this week’s Private Eye, and James believes him. Alan said he was happy not to go public on
anything while the investigation process was underway.

2. Meeting 8 July
Tan and Ron have agreed to present an interim report based on 3 cases to MPs, here at Westminster on 8
July. James has said to both them and Alan that at the moment, he is not minded to invite representatives
of the Post Office to attend, given that you will presumably only have just seen the report yourselves. Do
you have a view on this? James needs to think through this a little more, so it would be helpful if he knew
your thoughts.

Tam going to email Ron and Ian with all this as well, but wanted to let you know the view from this end is
good. Might you let Paula know please?

Kind regards
Janet
