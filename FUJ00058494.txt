ICL Pathway 100 Trial Surveys Report - Ref: o_o
ersion: 1.
Date: 2/03/98

1. Introduction

The post implementation review of Horizon in the release 1b post offices, undertaken
by POCL, suggested that certain Horizon components were not most efficiently
located for frequent and repetitive use. As a result POCL commissioned an ergonomic
study of the Horizon equipment in use at certain post offices in the South West
Region and from this review provided parameters to ICL Pathway to be used when
installing equipment.

As it was unknown whether this change would have a material effect on the cost of
preparation work a joint effort has been undertaken to survey 100 outlets following
the new parameters. This report provides a breakdown of the results into the following
categories:

¢ standard office preparations

e standard office preparations with stands or shelves

© office modifications (re-survey for screen/counter modifications)
¢ no solution offices

¢ impact of additional options

In addition this report covers any other issues that have been raised during this
exercise.

2. Scope

The 100 post offices visited have been specifically chosen as a representative sample
of the POCL estate. 80 were chosen from the offices currently operating the Horizon
platform (Live offices). The remaining 20 represent the larger branch offices and those
already with automation i.e. ECCO outlets.(New offices) !

For the purpose of this exercise it has been assumed that we are visiting the office for
the first time. The prices quoted reflect the total cost incurred to prepare the office in
accordance with the ergonomic parameters and where necessary, previous
documentation has been reviewed to determine the extent of work already undertaken.
If previous work is part of the proposed solution the associated cost is included in the
total office cost. Where it is not it is excluded.

I 4 offices were excluded from the Release 1B rollout as the cost of office modification was too great.
This means that the most expensive offices to prepare are missing from the 80 sampled. The average
cost of preparing these 4 offices was £4186.27 before the ergonomic parameters were imposed.

For example, in the majority of offices the cost of Image monitor stands have been
removed as they will become redundant when the final solution is implemented. In
offices where they will be utilised for another purpose, the cost has been included.

Likewise, it should not be assumed that the costs associated with the 80 existing
offices reflect the cost of upgrade to the ergonomic standard. In some instances extra
costs will be incurred in rectifying work already undertaken.

The cost of resurvey visits have been included where appropriate.

The Site Survey Requirements document, (Ref. [1]) was modified to reflect the
parameter changes and this together with the survey and resurvey processes were
agreed by both parties prior to the surveys taking place. In addition five different types
of monitor / keyboard stands, some of which are still undergoing ergonomic
evaluation, were considered. For all outlets that required a re-survey or offices where
no solution could be found, the following additional options were considered:

¢ POCL approved seating
¢ a flat screen monitor

¢ extension of the reach parameters defined in the ergonomic study

The use of a separate smart card reader was to be considered but this was discounted
during discussions on agreeing the Site Survey Requirements document as its use
created further operational difficulties.

The impact of using these additional options is covered in section 7.

3. Management Summary

Of the 100 offices surveyed, 18 were classified as no solution offices. With an estate
of 19,088 offices (excluding Cash Remittance Units) this would equate to 3,435
offices nationally.

For the remaining 82 offices costs have been split into:
¢ Site preparation costs including stands - Cost X
e Additional costs - Cost Y

Cost apportionment to allow the compilation of summary costs is defined in Appendix
A, but it is understood that reapportionment of some costs may take place following
joint discussions.

No of offices Cost X (£) Cost Y (£) total cost (£)
82 92,157.57 82,237.18 174,394.75

This gives an average cost per office of:

Cost X (£) Cost Y (£) total cost (£)
1,123.87 1,002.89 2,126.76

By subtracting the no solution offices from the total estate of 19,088, the remainder of
the estate which could be modified to accept Horizon is 15,653. This would give a
total cost of:

No of offices Cost X (£) Cost Y (£) total cost (£)
15,653 17,591,937.11 15,698,237.17 33,290,174.28

Recognising the inherent complications with this argument, propagating the average
cost across the whole estate would yield the following figures:

No of offices Cost X (£) Cost Y (£) total cost (£)
19,088 21,452,430.56 19,143,164.32 40,595,594.88

Costs quoted exclude Value Added Tax.
There has been no contingency allowed for any inconsistencies in the sample chosen.

No allowance has been made for any potential savings which could be expected from
competitively tendering for the shopfitting work.

4. Surveys

4.1 The survey teams

Due to the tight timescales involved in providing this report it was necessary for the
survey and resurvey processes to be conducted in a single visit.

The survey teams consisted of a Pathway surveyor with responsibility for completion
of the survey process, and a POCL surveyor to consider counter and screen
modifications where a resurvey was necessary. It was also felt that joint attendance
provided a check and balance to the process and would reduce the chance of solutions
being more involved than absolutely necessary.

It should be noted that neither attendees were qualified joiners and as a result some
solutions proposed could later be found to be either more expensive than estimated, or
impractical to achieve. Similarly there were some solutions which involved relocating
safes within the secure area of the Post Office. The prices quoted for this task covers
the cost of moving the safe. Any additional costs relating to structural work to
strengthen floors has not been included.

4.2 Training

All but one surveyor had no previous experience in conducting surveys on Post Office
premises. A one day training course for both ICL and POCL staff was conducted at
ICL Kidsgrove. It was felt by both parties that with the amount of information to be
conveyed, a 3 day training course would need to be undertaken by any Surveyor
involved in the National Rollout.

To supplement the training given, the survey teams were accompanied for the first 3
days by managers from within both ICL Pathway and POCL, to ensure that the
process was understood and adhered to.

4.3 Survey review

Every completed survey pack was reviewed on receipt and checked to ensure
compliance to the ergonomic parameters. It was then categorised as detailed in the

following section, and costings obtained from the following sources:

Work involved

Action

Joinery work

Referred to WTplc for quotation.

Screen modifications

Referred to POCL to cost screen parts.

Referred to WTple for labour quotation.

Relocating safes

Referred to POCL for quotation.

Relocating alarm circuits

Referred to POCL for quotation.

Electrical work

Costings supplied by WTple

As the process used by the Surveyors for considering monitor and keyboard stands
was based on the size of counter and did not consider the purchase price of the stand,
the review also considered whether there was a more cost effective solution where

stands were utilised. The prices quoted in this document reflect this reduction.

It should be noted that the estimates of joinery work were based on the narrative
reports provided by the Surveyors. The actual prices quoted may have to be revised
once a formal joinery survey is undertaken.

5. Results of the Survey

5.1 Outlet Categories

The results of the surveys have been broken down into the following categories:

Category A - offices which can be installed without any modifications.

Category B - offices that require the provision of items such as shelves and stands.

Category C - offices that require modifications to the counter, which includes
screen, parcel hatch and joinery modifications.

Category D - offices where either no solution could be found or the proposed
solution was unacceptable to the postmaster.

5.3 Stands

In addition to the shelves used to date, the survey also considered the following types
of stands.

1. “Flipper” - a combined monitor and keyboard stand which reduces the footprint by
raising the monitor over the keyboard. Estimated cost £64.”

2. “Dublin” - a combined monitor and keyboard stand which reduces the footprint by
holding the keyboard under the screen in a sliding drawer. Estimated cost £76.

3. “Kidsgrove” - a monitor stand which holds the monitor above the keyboard. The
keyboard remains on the counter. Estimated cost £64.

4. “Hodnet” (keyboard) - a keyboard shelf which allows the keyboard to extend over
the edge of the counter. Estimated cost £19.

5. “Hodnet” (printer) - similar to the keyboard version but designed to hold the

counter printer over the edge of the counter. Estimated cost £18.

5.4 Utilisation of Stands

Category No Used No of Offices
Flipper 20 5
Dublin 75 26
Kidsgrove 0 0
Hodnet (Keyboard) 28 15
Hodnet (Printer) 4 4

It should be noted that stands were required in 50% of the offices visited. If these
devices were not available the majority of offices would require major modification.

The Dublin stand proved popular in offices where extending the counter depth would
obstruct the cash drawer. It must be noted however that the use of this stand could
reduce the time taken to complete transactions as access to the drawer is restricted
while the keyboard is being used and vica versa.

? The cost of a flipper stand has been estimated as the same price as a Kidsgrove stand. This is because
the actual cost of the flipper stand would be based on the quantity ordered. There is a high tooling up
cost of around £40,000. The cost of production is relatively inexpensive. A formal quotation will be
obtained based on the result of this exercise.

6. No solution offices

There were 18 offices where no solution could be found to enable the Horizon system
to be installed according to the ergonomic parameters. These are covered in detail in
Appendix B and have been categorised into 4 groupings as follows:

1. SP counters - This is the latest type of counter to be installed in offices. It is of a
modular design and is intended to provide sufficient space for computer equipment.
Deficiencies have however been identified in installation as follows:

¢ It has been found that in some offices where space is limited, the modular unit
between each serving position has not been fitted. This means that more serving
positions can be accommodated, but there is little room to locate computer
systems.

¢ The depth of SP2000 counters has been set at 620mm to match the physical size
of the keyboard and monitor. The operational depth of the keyboard and monitor
with one directly in front of the other is 695mm. This means that unless
sufficient width is available between serving positions a monitor stand will have
to be employed to position the equipment. Even if sufficient width is available,
its use can be constrained by the reach radius of 650mm from the centre of the
serving position.

© 2 offices had SP2000 counters installed at a height of 1030mm. With the depth
restriction of 620mm a monitor stand was essential to extend the depth but due
to the height limit of 1320mm the only possible solution was to use Hodnet
keyboard stands. This would however have impeded access to cash drawers.

2. Ergonomics - The ergonomics report stipulated maximum and minimum heights
for positioning Horizon equipment. It also detailed the maximum distance that
frequently used items should be from the user. There were 3 offices where the
computer equipment could be positioned within the counter area if this restriction
was increased to 695mm or extended beyond the current restriction of the edge of
the counter.

1 office could have been satisfied by the provision of flat screen monitors.

3. Community Offices - There were 2 offices within the sample where the Horizon
equipment was located in the Living Room of a house. It has already been
identified that separate guidelines need to be provided in these circumstances.

ersion: 1.
Date: 2/03/98

4. Unacceptable solutions - There were 8 offices where the proposed solution was
unacceptable to the postmaster and alternative solutions could not be found without
breaching the ergonomic constraints. The key issues which prevented agreement
were:

e Encroachment into personal space.
e Encroachment into Retail space.

¢ Insufficient space to cater for the number of serving positions being
used.

7. Additional Options

7.1 Result of the review of additional options

The results of the review were as follows:

Option Number of counters Number of Offices
Flat screen monitor 15 10
Seats 0 0
Extended Reach 4 2
Expanded Reach 3 1
Self Inking Date Stamps 0 0

7.2 Flat Screen Monitor

The use of a touch screen monitor reduces the operational depth needed. Our
suppliers have identified a monitor which reduces the depth from 365mm to 200mm.
However this monitor is slightly higher and wider than the standard monitor.

Our review identified only 10 offices that would benefit from the use of the new
monitor. At 3 of these offices, the only saving was the cost of using a Dublin stand.

The total savings for the 10 offices was £6,315.37 (See Appendix C)

Development costs and the purchase cost of the new monitors have not been included.

7.3 Seats

It was proposed that by using POCL approved seating the operators body could be
raised to allows the centre of the monitor screen or the top of the operational height of

the equipment to be raised to 1410mm from the floor. (Without a chair the maximum
height from the floor is 1320mm).

There were no offices which were found to benefit from this option. In the smaller
offices there was insufficient space to locate a chair. In the larger offices, chairs were
already provided or there was already sufficient counter space available.

7.4 Extending the Reach Parameters

The offices in question were no solution offices and as such the issues are detailed in
section 6.

7.5 Expanding the Reach Parameters

This office was also a no solution office and is covered under section 6.

7.6 Self Inking Date Stamps

There were no occasions where the provision of self inking date stamps saved space
as the postmaster would include these items in his working space area.

8. Other Findings

e In 9 of the 20 new offices the number of counter positions differed from the figures
supplied. At 8 offices the requirement increased, at 1 it reduced. The net increase
was 9 counters i.e. the total number of counters increased from 104 to 113.

e There was a large variation in the amount of working space demanded by certain
postmasters. Unless a procedure is put in place to ensure that this is kept to a
minimum, there could be a large number of screen alterations forced on us due to
individual postmaster preferences.
