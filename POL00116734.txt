All, we did not think JA would go to Alice until such time as Paula had responded.

Having discussed here we think that as Paula is away, she should suggest he meets Chris to discuss his concerns as
Chris is the responsible Director. I am happy to discuss with Paula and then explain to Alice that this is in hand and

she should respond accordingly.
Grateful for views.
The good faith issue is one we should challenge strongly.

Best wishes
Belinda

Importance: High

Dear Alice

Tam becoming increasingly worried about how the sub-Postmasters mediation process is working. The
Post Office is treating the decision as to whether individual cases should go through to mediation as a legal
battlefield, to the extent that I am getting close to asking another Urgent Question in the House of
Commons about it. I have requested a meeting with Paula, who I know is on leave this week. My office is
receiving requests for me to talk to the media, and I intend to do so, but I want to discuss matters with
Paula first, if possible. I, the subpostmasters and Second Sight agreed to this process in the expectation
that it would be carried through in good faith. I would hate to be in a position of having to call that into
question.

Iam sorry to write in these terms, but I felt you needed to know how serious the matter was becoming.
Yours ever
James
