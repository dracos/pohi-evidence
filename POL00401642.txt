1 INFORMATION SECURITY PRINCIPLES

The Post Office Account is dependent on computer systems for the majority of it’s business activities.
A high level of computer security must be maintained to ensure business continuity and minimise
damage by preventing and reducing likelihood of security breaches. Information Security provides an
enabling mechanism for information sharing and ensures the protection of information and computer
assets.

Information assets are valuable and must be protected to ensure that their value is retained. Where
information is held in computer systems, the information technology must also be protected for the
security and integrity of the information to be maintained. An asset of the group includes buildings,
computer hardware and software, communications equipment, personnel, data and documentation.

The essential element involved in securing any technology-based system is to address how
confidentiality, integrity and availability are to be assured against the known threats.

¢ Confidentiality is ensuring that the information held by Post Office Account is accessible
only to those who are authorised to have access.

¢ Integrity is safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing
methods.

¢ Availability is ensuring that information and services are available when required.

1.1 SECURITY PHILOSOPHY

The essential overarching security requirements in this document are based on a number of basic
security concepts that form the fundamental philosophy. These concepts, which are detailed below,
are good guiding principles that are further developed throughout this document.

* The Need-to-know Principle. The need-to-know principle is widely used in many areas of
commercial and government work. The principle states that information (in this case
information relating to the networks) should only be made available to those individuals who
have a legitimate need for it.

* The Least Privilege Principle. The principle of least privilege means that any user or
system should only have the privileges that they require in order to perform their assigned
tasks. For example, an ordinary user would not usually be given the privileges necessary to
reconfigure network devices.

¢ The Weakest Link Principle. Security can be considered to be a chain that is only as strong
as its weakest link. An advanced network security solution is completely invalidated if there
is a weak point such as an alternative, unsecured means of access. The weakest link principle
is that security resources are firstly directed at the weakest links in the security of a network.

e The Fail-Safe Stance Principle. The principle of fail-safe stance is that in the event that a
system or network component should fail, then it should fail in such a way that access to data
or network resources is denied, not allowed. For example, in the event of the failure of a
firewall, the device should block all traffic, not pass it.

¢ The Universal Participation Principle. The principle of Universal Participation is that all
the users, administrators and other personnel involved in the use of a network are involved in
the security operation, each placing a high priority upon it and co-operating with one another
to secure the network.

POL00401642

~ Ref: RS/POL/002
FUJITSU Horizon Security Policy Version: 11.0
FUJITSU SERVICES
Commercial in Confidence Date: 24-Feb-2006

e The Defence in Depth Principle. The principle of defence in depth is that there should be
several layers of security which together comprise the overall security solution for a network
and no single technology or approach is enough. For example it is not acceptable to simply
secure the perimeter of a network with firewalls: the systems inside the network must be
hardened to prevent attack from inside the firewall, and intrusion detection systems should
monitor the network internally.

¢ Security at the Design Phase Principle. Security should be incorporated at the design stage
so that the entire design process is conducted with security in mind. Good secure design
approaches such as the use of choke points and strategically placed firewalls are then
incorporated from the beginning.

To achieve the above principles Post Office Account and its employees must adhere to the following
codes of practice:

¢ Information security is the responsibility of the Post Office Account and cannot be delegated
to any third party.

* Techniques and procedures will be maintained to measure the effectiveness of information
security.

© The value of each major information asset will be determined by risk analysis.

e Each asset will be assigned a classification according to an agreed scheme.

* Protection given to each asset will be appropriate to its value and the threats it faces.
e¢ Each asset will have an owner who will be responsible for its protection.

Only authorised and licensed software will be used on Post Office Account systems.

e All users of Post Office Account information assets will receive appropriate training to ensure
they are able to fulfil their individual responsibilities towards information security.

¢ Users of Post Office Account information assets must be aware of their value and safeguard
them accordingly.

e Information security concerns and breaches must be reported in accordance with escalation
procedures.

* Managers have prime responsibility for security in areas they manage.

© Users of Post Office Account information and systems will be responsible for the security of
information and systems accessed by them.

© Failure to comply with the Information Security Policy will result in disciplinary proceedings.

¢ We will comply with all relevant regulatory, legal and licence obligations

2 SECURITY POLICY

2.1 INFORMATION SECURITY POLICY

This document seeks to address threats and weaknesses within Post Office Account by providing
policy, standards and guidance that addresses the security risk to the electronic, physical and
personnel security environments. Moreover, it will detail the security methodology that is to applied,
outline respective security responsibilities and provide detail as to how security incidents should be
handled.

It will also reflect any wider security requirements that have relevance and any agreed National or
International security standards.

This security policy is compliant with, as far as practical, to BS7799/ISO 17799, The Code Of
Practice for Information Security Management and adopts a similar security methodology as
contained within the Security Management document which forms part of the Information
Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL).

This approach provides a recognised security standard in order that they can have a high degree of
confidence in the Company’s ability to operate the network securely and protect their
information/processes from any form of unauthorised access or manipulation.

3. ORGANISATION
3.1. POLICY

Executive, management, specialist and staff responsibilities and accountabilities for information
security will be defined and communicated. This management framework will initiate, maintain and
control information security throughout the group.

3.1.1 General Principle

To ensure the effective and timely implementation of information security throughout the Post Office
Account, responsibilities need to be defined clearly for all levels of management, information users
and systems developers or operators. In this way, all staff and contractors, business partners and
suppliers can properly execute their information security duties, and appropriate training and facilities
can be provided to all concerned.

3.2. INFORMATION SECURITY ORGANISATION

3.2.1 Overview

There are a number of business responsibilities for information security. It is essential that
responsibilities are defined within the Business Unit to ensure information security is being addressed
locally within all divisions. The roles identified will mainly be incorporated into existing duties;
however it may be necessary for some divisions to appoint a security administrator where the nature
of the task justifies this.

FUJITSU Horizon Security Policy Version: 11.0
FUUTSU SERVICES Commercial in Confidence Date: 24-Feb-2006

Accountability for implementing security measures will rest with the identified owner or responsible
manager, the security classification scheme allowing security to be directed where it is needed most.
4.1.1 General Principle

Information security must be applied with due regard to the balance between the risk being reduced
and the cost of implementing controls. A security classification process will enable the Post Office
Account to differentiate between ‘sensitive’ information, and information regarded as less valuable.
Security can be directed where it is most needed and not wasted where it is not justified.

The classification must take account of business needs for sharing or redirecting the
information, and the impact associated with unauthorised access, damaged (incomplete or
inaccurate) or non availability to the information.

4.2 INVENTORY OF ASSETS

4.2.2 Types of Assets

Information can be held in various forms, an asset inventory must be maintained for each. All
information will be classified in general by subject, although it is anticipated that some subjects will
have specific areas which may need a higher classification, these will be identified as special files.
Assets have been grouped by type to enable a clear understanding of where boundaries lie. The
necessary requirements for the inventory are also described below.

4.2.3, Information Assets

Information which is held on paper, in databases or data files, system documentation, user manuals,
training material, operational or support procedures, continuity plans and fallback arrangements,
backup files can all be categorised by subject. E.g. all staff, information held in any of the above
forms will be classed as Personal. The inventory will hold the following information:-

* The information subject asset name and high level description
«The information asset classification,

¢ Special files classification in any subject information

«The information subject owner.

* The information subject custodian.

4.2.4 Software Assets

All information systems which are built from application software, system software, development
tools and utilities will be identified and classified by the IT facility name. E.g. all application
software, system software, licenses, development tools and utilities which are used to provide the
HORIZON system will be classed as HORIZON assets. The inventory should hold the following
information:-

© The IT facility asset name and high level description
e The IT facility asset classification.

* The classification of special files in the IT facility.

4.2.5 Physical Assets

Physical assets which are critical to the continuity of business include computer and communications
equipment, magnetic media (tapes and disks), specialist technical equipment (power supplies, air-
conditioning units), furniture and accommodation. E.g. the critical physical components which enable
business operation. The inventory should hold the following information:-

« The physical asset name and high level description.

© Date of physical asset purchase.

«The serial number of the physical asset and its components.
«The location of the physical asset.

© The division accountable for the asset.

4.2.6 Service Assets

services, heating, lighting, power, air conditioning, postal, distribution should be classified. E.g. the
heating service within all corporate sites.

© The service asset name and high level description.
° The service providers contact name.
«The service contract commencement and expiry date.

« The person accountable for the asset.
4.3, INFORMATION OWNERSHIP

4.3.1 Ownership and Custodianship

All major information assets identified will where appropriate, have an assigned named owner who
will be responsible for ensuring the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the asset.

Owners must have sufficient authority and knowledge to allow them to appreciate the value of their
system and or information. They will be responsible for classifying the asset they own, and therefore
ensuring that sufficient protection is being applied and maintained. The protection required must be
commensurate with the value and the risk.

Custodians are appointed by the asset owners to undertake day-to-day tasks and make operational
decisions on behalf of the owner.

4.4 SECURITY CLASSIFICATION

4.4.1 Classification Overview

Classification is the means used by Post Office Account of establishing and recording the value of its
assets to ensure the correct level of protection is afforded. A group classification for each information

POL00401642
POL00401642

Ref: RS/POL/002
FUJITSU Horizon Security Policy Version: 11.0
FUJITSU SERVICES
Commercial in Confidence Date: 24-Feb-2006

subject, IT facility, equipment or service asset will be given. Within each there may be elements
which need to be classified at a higher level. These elements will be identified as special files.

It is essential that any classification scheme is simple to understand and easy to apply. It should
match, as much as possible; the schemes of trading partners and suppliers, and it should describe the
security controls associated with each level. It is also essential that information and systems are
valued correctly. Over classification will lead to waste of effort. Under classification will reduce the
protection afforded.

4.5 ASSESSMENT OF ASSETS

The criteria to be considered when assessing the value of the assets being classified include:

« Strategic Value - The degree to which the asset affects or reflects the Group's current or
future strategy. The extent to which the disclosure of information, to the media or other
parties, would disadvantage the Group.

e Business Value - The actual or potential value that the asset could have to other
organisations. The effect on the Group's business if the information were lost or inaccurate.

¢ Legal Liability - Where disclosure or inaccuracy may result in legal action. In particular
personal data, which is normally subject to data protection or data privacy laws, must not be
classified lower than RESTRICTED.

¢ Embarrassment - The extent to which the information, if disclosed, would undermine
confidence in the Group.

¢ Cost of Creation/Reconstruction - Information that requires considerable effort to be
created or reconstructed.
4.6 CLASSIFICATION SCHEME
Information should be valued (“classified”) according to three main security attributes:
¢ Confidentiality: this rating measures the level of damage to the organisation that would
result from unauthorised disclosure of information.

« Integrity: this rating measures the level of damage to the organisation that would result
from loss, corruption or fraudulent modification of the asset.

« Availability: this rating measures the time criticality of the recovery mechanisms that
must be applied if the asset was not available.
4.7 CLASSIFYING INFORMATION

4.7.1 Labelling of Assets

All assets which have been classified will be labelled with the classification. Any special files
identified should also be labelled with an inventory reference.

4.8 SUMMARY OF FUJITSU CLASSIFICATIONS AND PRIVACY MARKINGS

4.9.3 Levels of Protection

When responding to a document received from Post Office it is essential to ensure the correct
classification of the response and the levels of required protection. If this is unclear,
enquiries should be made with the document owner to confirm the classification of the
response level of protection and levels of protection required.

Post Office classifications and descriptors marked ‘*’ are most likely to be seen by Fujitsu in
the course of normal business, however, the possibility of receiving documents containing
other markings should not be discounted

physically protected from environmental hazards, unauthorised access, and deliberate damage or
interference. Measures will be commensurate with the classification of the information or system to
be protected.

6.1.1 General Principle

There are minimum Codes of Practice for the physical security of Post Office Account computer
installations and telecommunications networks. There are three categories of sites to which these
practices apply:

e Data centres, such as SDCO1 and SDC02, etc,

* Sites housing support functions or small multi-user systems, such as, HSH, SMC/SMG,
BRAOI, including SSC and IRE11, including Belfast Operations,

¢ Areas within Fujitsu Services premises with PCs, standalone or networked, or terminals
connected to host systems.

When considering new construction or major alterations, physical security requirements must be
evaluated against the importance of the installation, the data held and processed, and the threats to
which the site is exposed.

6.2 PHYSICAL SECURITY PERIMETERS

6.2.1 Implementation of Physical Security Measures

The actual measures to be applied will vary with the nature and amount of information, IT
systems and telecommunications facilities at the site.

6.3 DATA CENTRE LOCATION AND CONSTRUCTION

The location and design of data centres and computer rooms will take into account the possibility of
damage from fire, flood, and explosions, civil unrest and other forms of natural or man made
disasters. Consideration must also be given to any security threats posed by neighbouring
accommodation.

The following security features must be considered and where appropriate included in the design and
construction:

« A security fence around a free-standing data centre;
¢ Walls, ceilings and floors constructed to retard combustion;

¢ Doors to resist forced entry and retard combustion;

FUJITSU SERVICES
Commercial in Confidence Date: 24-Feb-2006

* Power and communications cables duplicated and physically separated from each other and
from other utility services;

e Lightning conductors.

Contingency, alternate and backup sites must be located and equipped so that they will not be affected
by the same incident that disrupts business at the prime site. Issues to be considered include power
supplies, communications routing, physical distance between the locations etc.

6.4 SIGNAGE

Buildings housing IT equipment and facilities (data centres, areas housing IT hardware which support
secret, essential and time critical applications) should be unobtrusive and give no indication of their
purpose. Internal directories and telephone books must not indicate the location of facilities.

6.5 ENTRANCES AND EXITS

Access points must be kept to a minimum and be subject to auditable access control measures.
Emergency exits and other external doors must be fitted with alarms. Unoccupied secure areas must
be physically locked and subject to periodic checks,

6.6 INTRUSION DETECTION

Intrusion detection alarm systems must be used for installations which are left unattended. These may
be either part of 24-hour security cover or connected to a security company or the Police. Alarm
systems must be tested regularly and maintained to manufacturers’ requirements.

6.7 SEPARATION OF FACILITIES AND SUPPLIES

Support functions and equipment, such as facsimile machines, photocopiers, etc, must be located
away from secure areas to eliminate the need for, or prevent the risk of, unauthorised access.

Hazardous and combustible materials must be stored securely at a safe distance from sites. Computer
supplies such as stationery must be retained in store rooms and not transferred to data centres until
required.

Back up media must be stored at a safe distance to avoid damage from a disaster at the main site.
Back up media must be verified and checked for completeness, then moved away from the prime site
as soon as possible.

6.8 INTERNAL SECURITY

There must be an effective fire safety programme which adheres to all local and national fire
regulations, which have been approved by the appropriate fire prevention advisor. Measures must
minimise the risk of fire from occurring within an installation, or from spreading into the installation
from an adjoining area.

Automatic fire detection systems must be installed in all critical computer facilities.

Inert fire suppressant systems must be fitted to computer areas supporting critical business processes,
with the ability for automatic operation during periods when the buildings are unmanned. Where
flammable material is present in inaccessible places, total flooding systems (inert suppression
systems), should be used. Personnel must not be endangered by the operation of an automatic
extinguishing system. Full training and documented procedures must be available to all staff working
in areas protected by fire suppressant systems.

the appropriate licences purchased.

All local and applicable International legislation governing software copyright must be complied with.

8.11.2 Virus Controls

Virus detection software must be installed and updated in accordance with agreed standards on all
networked PCs, to scan all media on access. The software must provide the best possible protection
against all known virus types (Macro, binary etc.). Unless there is a business requirement or local
need, consideration should be given to disabling floppy drives or restricting them to prevent the
loading of certain types of files (.exe, .bat, etc.)

Where virus protection is not provided on machines a stand alone virus detection (“sheep dip”)
machine should be provided to check all magnetic media (diskettes, CDs etc.) brought into the Post
Office Account or loaded from a PC without virus protection. Clear instructions must be provided to
all staff to ensure that disks are not introduced into the Post Office Account without being virus
checked.

All machines, without virus protection, removed from Post Office Account premises must be scanned
for viruses upon their return and prior to connection to any network.

All virus occurrences must be logged and treated as security incidents.

8.12 PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE

All purchased software must, where possible, before use be examined carefully on an isolated
environment which does not contain essential, secret or time critical files.

Normal acceptance testing must be sufficient to detect viruses in bespoke or customised software. PC
software obtained “shrink-wrapped” from a reputable supplier may be considered to be low risk (but
not no risk!). PC software obtained from the public domain, or received unsolicited, must be
considered to be high risk and must be verified in an isolated environment before use.

The downloading of free software or shareware by individual users must not be permitted. If such
software is required for business purposes it must be requested via the system manager, licence fees
paid, and tested.

Unsupported software should only be used with appropriate levels of authorisation.

8.13, USE OF GAMES/SHAREWARE/NON-PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE

Games software and applications which have no valid Post Office Account business purpose must not
be used.

Software available free or cheaply (“shareware”) must not be used on Post Office Account computers

process. In such cases, line managers must:

° Confirm that the user holds a valid license to use the software for the intended purpose on
Post Office Account equipment

«Obtain approval for this use from senior line management

«Ensure that the software is appropriately tested before it is loaded onto Post Office Account
computers or networks

© Check periodically that the user continues to hold a valid license
« Delete the software as soon as the user leaves the Post Office Account or ceases to hold a
valid license for the software
8.14 SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
System BIOS should be password protected to prevent unauthorised modification to the configuration
of personal computers and network servers.

8.15 HOUSEKEEPING MEASURES

8.15.1 Data Back-up

To permit recovery from system failure, data corruption or virus infection, and to satisfy legal, system
classification or nominated data owners’ requirements, all data must be backed up.

Backed up data must be stored securely and off-site away from the prime source of information.

Off site storage must provide appropriate environmental and other (fire proof safe, access etc.)
controls.

Retained information must be allocated a date when retention can cease, and a method of disposal
(where appropriate) should be stated.

Back-up data must be regularly audited and tested to ensure that it can be relied upon in an
emergency.

Procedures must be established to control movement of data between the prime and back-up locations.
Documentation must also be retained at both sites which details the location and content of data.

Local data (stored on floppy or PC hard drives) must be reviewed, and where a classification of at
least important, confidential or time significant is allocated then the data must be subject to local
agreements to provide regular back-ups and off-site storage and testing.

Data stored on lap-top computers which is not subject to automated back-up routines, to minimise the
potential loss of information additional backup routines must be implemented which ensure that:

Data is backed up regularly either to file servers or floppy disks.

Users are made aware of their responsibilities to back up data in relation to the frequency of taking
backups and assistance in relation to the storage and security of these backups.

8.15.2 Operator Logs

Computer operators must maintain logs of all work carried out, to include as appropriate:

¢ Systems start and finish times.

satisfactorily resolved, and to identify any trends.

8.15.4 Environmental Monitoring

Temperature, humidity and power supply quality must be monitored in accordance with
manufacturers’ specifications.

8.16 NETWORK MANAGEMENT

8.16.1 Network Security Controls

Operational responsibility for networks should be separated from computer operations where
practical.

Responsibilities and procedures for the management and control of remote equipment,
including equipment located in user areas, must be clearly established.

Controls must be established to safeguard the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data
passing over public networks, and to protect connected systems.

Sensitive information travelling across a network must be encrypted. Essential information
must be authenticated e.g. digital signature.

Computer and network management activities must be closely co-ordinated to optimise the
service to business and to ensure that security measures are consistently applied across the IS
infrastructure.

Networks must be designed to avoid a single point of failure, and configured to automatically
re-route around failures. Tables containing the routing options of operational networks must
be maintained, and protected as secret documents.

8.16.2 External Connections

External connections must be routed through appropriate controls (physical isolation, logical
access controls, message checking, Firewalls, auditing etc.) to ensure system and network
security,

8.17 CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS

applied to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data, and to safeguard connected computer
systems.

The security controls applied to EDI transactions must be agreed with the trading partners.

8.20 SECURITY OF ELECTRONIC MAIL

E-mail systems are inherently insecure. Access control is weakened by the tendency of users
to leave themselves connected, and by personal authentication only being password-based.
Great care must be taken before such systems are used.

External electronic mail must not be used to transmit secret information for Post Office
Account use and knowledge only.
8.20.1 Security of Electronic Office Systems
The security of electronic office facilities must consider:
e Policy and controls to manage information-sharing on electronic bulletin boards.

9 SYSTEM ACCESS CONTROL

9.1 POLICY

Access to Post Office Account business Information, systems and networks will be restricted to
authorised persons only, in order to prevent and detect unauthorised use or abuse. Monitoring will
take place to in order to ensure adherence to this policy

9.1.1 General Principle

To maintain effective security within the Post Office Account it is vital to ensure that data
can be accessed and processed by authorised people. To provide this level of protection,
clear and concise procedures and standards must be documented and communicated to all
employees. This section contains general principles regarding access to systems and data.
Specific detailed access controls will be published with the Horizon Access Control Policy
(ACP).

9.2 ACCESS TO COMPUTER SERVICES AND DATA

9.2.1 Documented Access Policy

Line managers must strictly control access to information systems and networks under their direction
or ownership. They must implement a formal process for requesting, authorising, granting, reviewing
and revoking access rights to Post Office Account business information, systems and networks.

Business managers, through their nominated system, application and network owners (“owners”),
must maintain a clearly defined access policy. This policy must define the access rights to each
information system, application and network under their direction or ownership, for each user or
group of users (based upon agreed role profiles).

Access to each system, application and network must only be granted in response to a formal
application via the owner. Lists must be maintained of all users or groups of users for each
information system, application and network.

Lists of users or groups of users for each information system, application and network must be
maintained by designated systems security administrators (“administrators”), who must manage user
access in accordance with the access policy.

When approving access rights, business managers must consider a user or group of users’:
* Need for access
¢ Potential conflict due to overlapping responsibilities (segregation of duties)
e Incompatible job functions
e The level of access required (read, update, delete)

© The period of access.

9.3. IDENTIFICATION

In order to establish individual accountability for all activities, each user of a shared computer system
or network should have a unique UserID allocated by the appropriate system or network security
administrator e.g. except in exceptional circumstances the sharing of userids will not be allowed.

9.4 AUTHENTICATION

It is necessary to verify that the user is the authorised user (owner of the UserID). This can be carried
out by a number of means, including passwords, tokens and Personal Identification Numbers (PINS).

Each system must verify that a UserID is valid and is authorised to perform the task.

9.5 AUTHORISATION

Each system must allow access to computer resources only to users who have valid authority. Such
access must be based on the principles that

Access to computer services, data and networks will be assumed to be not required unless specifically
requested.

The owner of an information resource decides who should have access to that resource and in what
mode (read, write etc.) and supplies confirmation to users of their access privileges.

Whenever a user attempts to access a resource, the access control system checks and verifies that the
access can be authorised. If access is forbidden the access violation must be recorded and
investigated.

9.6 ALLOCATION OF ACCESS RIGHTS

9.6.1 User Registration

Access to all multi-user IS services must be controlled through a formal user registration and de-
registration procedure operated by the administrators.

Access to information systems and networks must only be granted by the administrators once a
written request (or an alternative agreed method Email etc.) has been received and authorised by the
owner or nominated deputy. A record of all requests to grant access must be retained by the
administrator in accordance with agreed Post Office Account document retention standards.

Owners must provide users with a written statement of their access rights, together with guidelines
which detail users’ security responsibilities.

Owners must ensure that controls are in place to prevent access until the authorisation procedures are
complete.

Periodic checks must be carried out to identify inactive user accounts. Access rights for these
accounts must be revoked until the validity of the account has been determined.

Controls must be in place to ensure that user accounts are removed immediately for any user who has
changed jobs or left the Post Office Account

In addition to the access controls and procedures for individuals who join, transfer within or leave the
Post Office Account, owners must ensure that user access rights are reviewed on a regular basis (at
least annually).

9.6.2 User Profiles and UserIDs

In order to establish individual accountability for all activities, each user of a shared computer system
or network must have a unique identification (UserID) allocated by the system security administrator.
The UserID should be the employees Post Office Account staff ID, in the case of temporary or
contract staff a unique identifier should be agreed with the security administrator. Associated with
this UserID must be a user profile detailing:

« The UserID

¢ The users name
© Details of access privileges
© Other information as appropriate

These user profiles may then be used to control the activities of authorised users on the system. They
must be regularly monitored by the appropriate systems security administrator, to confirm their
validity and accuracy.

9.6.3. New Users and Alterations to an Existing UserID
System security administrators must carry out the following actions when authorising a new UserID,
or when altering/suspending/removing an existing UserID:

¢ Only perform the changes following a written management authorisation

¢ Send confirmation of the changes to the user and his/her line manager.

¢ Forward an initial password for temporary use to new users under separate cover.

¢ Release of Locked-Out UserIDs

System security administrators must carry out the following actions when processing requests for
releasing a UserID following its being locked out by the system:

¢ Investigate the reason for the lock out.
¢ Consult with the user, and if necessary the users line management.
« Reactivate the UserID only when satisfied that such reactivation is appropriate.
¢ Document each incident. When an incident is unexplained, or in repeated cases, line
management must be informed.
9.7 PASSWORDS

Unless other secure and agreed verification methods are present, biometrics, tokens, etc, passwords
must be in place to control access to all information systems, applications and networks. User
passwords must:

* Be kept private, individuals will be held accountable for all activities undertaken by their
UserID.

« Bea minimum of 6 characters in length.
* Include at least one alphabetic and one numeric character.
e Expire after 30 days,

An initial password assigned to a new or re-instated user must automatically expire when first used
and require the entry of a new password chosen by the user. System, application and network
parameters must prevent:

* The reuse of previous passwords (the previous twelve passwords must be checked).

e The use of weak passwords (user id, user name, system name, no more than two consecutive
characters are the same etc.)

FUJITSU Horizon Security Policy Version: 11.0
FUJITSU SERVICES
Commercial in Confidence Date: 24-Feb-2006

User access after the entry of three consecutive incorrect passwords

Passwords must not be incorporated into any automated log on process or stored in a macro or
function key.

All passwords stored on computers must be protected by one way encryption, and must not be
displayed in clear-text on printouts, screens etc. Passwords must also be protected to at least the same
level as the information to which they allow access,

The use of distress passwords should be considered where members of staff may be put under duress
through, threat, kidnap, burglary, etc. A distress password is a pre-arranged password, different from
a user’s usual password that is used to signal that the user is being coerced to access the system under
duress.

9.8 ISSUE AND REISSUE OF PASSWORDS

System security administrators must carry out the following actions when issuing / reissuing
passwords:

«© The new password must be delivered to the correct person by a secure means and separate
from its associated UserID.

New passwords must only be provided to people who have forgotten their password only after
verifying that the person requesting a new password is in fact the owner of the UserID. This will
require that the request is made:

e Inperson
e Byan authorised line manager or supervisor

© Use of an independent authentication system

9.9 SPECIAL AND PRE-SET PASSWORDS AND USERIDS.

Default passwords and/or UserIDs issued with new software or hardware must be changed as soon as
possible, and before operational use of the software or hardware. Revised passwords must be as long
in length as possible and include both alphabetic and numeric characters.

System manager and other powerful privileged passwords and UserIDs must be strictly controlled.

9.10 TOKENS

Tokens are physical objects such as plastic cards or smart cards which a user holds for authentication
purposes. On their own they are more secure than passwords since owners will be aware of their loss.
However, tokens are normally used in conjunction with PIN numbers or passwords thus providing an
even greater level of security.

Token/PIN administration must be under dual control, and must be segregated from other functional
tasks. It must ensure that:

The process of creating, updating or enabling host records is under the control of at least two
individuals

Users must acknowledge receipt of the token/PIN before the token is enabled.

Token/card and PIN issuing and distributing facilities must be completely physically separated, and
controlled separately. The despatch of tokens/cards and PINs must be separated by at least three

working days, unless such separation is achieved by different methods of delivery. Token systems
must:

e Permit the PIN number to be user changeable

e Ensure that the PIN is at least four characters in length
«Ensure that the PIN and UserID are different

e Permit a maximum of three attempts allowed for PIN entry
«Ensure that PINs sent across transmission lines are encrypted
e Ensure that tokens are resistant to tampering and duplication

A record of all tokens issued must be retained and employees required to sign for the token. A
document must be issued with all tokens which details acceptable uses and the consequences for
misuse.

Tokens must be recovered when a staff member is reassigned or on termination of their employment.

9.11 BIOMETRICS

The use of biometric verification should be considered, subject to risk analysis, to provide additional
levels of security for all commercially sensitive or critical information.

A biometric is a physical characteristic or piece of information unique to an individual that can be
used in preference or in addition to a password. Examples of such biometrics include fingerprints,
signature dynamics, retina scans and speech characteristics.

9.12, AUTHENTICATION FAILURES

After the maximum number of consecutive attempts allowed to provide the correct authentication, by
password, token or biometric, has been exceeded, a user’s ID must be locked out until restored by the
appropriate system security administrator. All authentication failures must be logged, and the
appropriate administrators informed.

9.13 EMERGENCY ACCESS RIGHTS

Emergency situations, escalation procedures and emergency actions must be defined, approved and
documented.

Owners must nominate in advance those users to whom emergency system, application or network
access may be granted.

Such emergency passwords and UserIDs can provide powerful privileges and must therefore be
strictly controlled. Where these are pre-allocated, they must be retained securely under lock and key.

9.14 EMERGENCY PASSWORDS MUST BE CHANGED AFTER EACH USE.

Use of emergency access rights must be strictly monitored and audited, and the reasons for their use
reviewed by line management after the event.

Owners must log all use of emergency access rights. Such logs must be reviewed regularly by
business managers.

9.15 LOGON PROCESS

Systems, applications and networks must identify and verify the identity of each user when access is
requested. If necessary the terminal or location of the access request must also be matched against the
user’s profile.

The logon process must require the entry of a unique UserID and some form of secret or unique
authentication information (password, token, biometrics etc.) No system or application identifiers
must be displayed until the logon process is complete.

A general notice must be displayed before logon to indicate that Post Office Account systems,
applications and networks must only be used by authorised personnel for business purposes only.

Post Office Account systems must not indicate which part of a failed access request was incorrect, or
provide any assistance. The session must be disconnected immediately.

Systems, applications and networks must maintain a record of all failed logon attempts to allow audit
and investigation.

9.16 SYSTEM AND NETWORK USERS

9.16.1 User Responsibilities

Users must be made aware of their responsibilities for maintaining effective access controls,
particularly regarding the use and selection of passwords together with the security, protection and
maintenance of user equipment.

departmental UserIDs must not be used unless there is a specific system restriction or an overriding
business need. In all such instances, a waiver will be required.

Inactive sessions should be automatically terminated (timed out) after 15 minutes, unless the time out
would result in delays to customer service, in these instances a password protected screen saver must
be used.

9.18 APPLICATION ACCESS CONTROLS

9.18.1 User Controls

Access to applications and their data must be restricted to authorised users, to the minimum level
required for them to undertake their duties. Access must be denied by default.

To ensure that user access is limited to approved privileges, user access to applications must wherever
possible be via controlled menus or graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

Applications must control access rights of users, e.g. read, write, delete, execute etc.

Applications must control distributed management functions via a GUI.

Audit trails and logs must be protected to minimise the risk of unauthorised manipulation. They must
be monitored regularly to detect unusual or unauthorised access attempts, and investigated.
Information which is subject of an investigation or audit must be preserved and specially protected as
it may be required as evidence in a court of Jaw.

9.34. CLOCK SYNCHRONISATION

The Horizon network and all systems operating within Horizon will be synchronised on
Greenwich Mean Time.

Procedures must be established and followed to ensure all systems clocks and therefore logs
reflect the correct date and time in respect of Greenwich Mean Time and that during periods
of British Summer Time that Horizon remains synchronised on Greenwich Mean Time.

10 SYSTEM DEVELOPME

10.1 POLICY

Appropriate security features will be incorporated at the design stage, and then maintained during the
life-cycle of all applications, systems and networks.

10.1.1 General Principle

Security countermeasures are substantially cheaper and more effective if incorporated in application
systems at the requirements specification and design stages.

10.2 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR APPLICATIONS SYSTEMS AND
NETWORKS
10.2.1 Project Development

A development environment, where application or other system software is being developed and
tested prior to being used ‘live’, must be subject to strict security. Of particular importance are access
controls, separation from ‘live’ systems, and change/version control,

An analysis of security requirements must be undertaken at the development stage of any new
systems, application or network project. Business requirements for such projects, or for
enhancements to existing systems, applications and networks, must specify the requirements for
security controls, both automated and manual.

Security controls must reflect the business value of the information assets to be protected, together
with an identification of the potential loss or damage which may result from a failure or absence of
security.

Security controls must protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets. All
types of control (manual and automatic, technical and traditional) should be used, to prevent, detect
and recover from all potential security incidents and breaches. Security controls must:

¢ Control access to information and services
* Segregate duties

© Produce audit trails

e Verify and protect the integrity of data

© Satisfy back-up requirements

e Ensure business continuity

«Protect the data from unauthorised or accidental amendment, modification and access

10.2.2 Risk Assessment
System owners and project managers must conduct risk assessments for each new project, or for
important modifications to existing systems, to consider:

¢ Business Risk

© Project Risk

¢ Security Risk

FUJITSU Horizon Security Policy Version: 11.0
FUJITSU SERVICES
Commercial in Confidence Date: 24-Feb-2006

In this way, the potential risks to the system can be identified, and the countermeasures needed to
minimise these risks can be designed and implemented. As part of this risk assessment, measures to
address the following security requirements must be considered:

* Control of access to networks.

© Protection of transmitted information against unauthorised disclosure, alteration, destruction
or interference.

e Personal authentication of communicating parties who are carrying out transactions or
exchanging messages.

« Message authentication of transactions and messages between communicating parties.

10.2.3 End User Computing
Business systems developed by user departments must be designed and implemented in accordance
with this policy. Particular attention must be given to the following areas

e System design

© Acceptance testing

* Change control

¢ Access control

e Backup and restore requirements

« Documentation
10.3 SECURITY IN DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT ENVIRONMENTS

10.3.1 Control of Operational Software

The updating of operational program libraries must be restricted to authorised personnel. An audit log
of all changes or updates to operational program libraries must be maintained.

Executable code should not be implemented until it has been successfully tested, and user acceptance
has been obtained.

As a contingency measure, an archiving mechanism must be in place to ensure all previous versions
of software are retained.
10.3.2 System Test Data

Control procedures for operational application systems must also apply to test application systems.
Live data must be erased from test applications immediately after all testing is complete.

Authorisation must be obtained from data or application owners before live data is copied to a test
application. Such events must be logged for audit purposes.

10.3.3 Third Party Software

Wherever possible, code in third party software packages should not be modified - any changes could
affect the security functionality of the software or invalidate vendor support agreements.

FUJITSU Horizon Security Policy Version: 11.0
FUJITSU SERVICES
Commercial in Confidence Date: 24-Feb-2006

Redevelopment might also be necessary when implementing new versions of the package. Before any
changes are made to third party software, applications owners should consider the following:

¢ Will vendor support be available after changes are made?

« Has vendor consent for changes been obtained?

e Are the proposed changes available from the vendor as standard program updates?
« How will changes be made to future versions of software?

e Will internal expertise be available when further changes or updates are required?
¢ Are there any legal implications to the changes?

e Are the proposed changes necessary and cost effective?

10.3.4 Separate Development Environments
Development environments must be separated physically and logically from live environments to
protect the live environments from unauthorised access or modification.

10.4 CHANGE CONTROL PROCEDURES

10.4.1 Change Control

There must be strict control over the implementation of changes to the software or hardware of any
Post Office Account system, application or network. Such change control procedures must ensure
that any changes do not compromise any security or control procedure. Change control must ensure:

© The identification of all components affected by the change.

e The authorisation of all changes and their approval on completion.
¢ The control of software versions at each stage.

© Quality and content control.

© The maintenance of a full record of all changes (audit trail)

e The deletion of any temporary UserIDs/passwords, data and linkages when the system
becomes live.

¢ Changes only carry out their required function and nothing more.
© Only those changes that have been tested are implemented on the live system.

« Changes meet operational requirements.

10.5 EMERGENCY CHANGES

Change controls procedures must exist which permit the controlled correction of live systems in
emergencies in order to meet production deadlines. At least two persons must implement such
changes. The change must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate line management as soon as
possible. After review, emergency changes must be removed from the live environment or
consolidated via the normal change control procedure.

11 BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANNING
11.1 POLICY

Business continuity plans will be available to protect critical business processes from the effects of
major failures or disasters.
11.1.1 General Principle

In most areas of the Post Office Account, Information Technology is a critical element of the
business. Business Continuity Planning (BCP) provides a framework for the identification and
implementation of commercially effective contingency arrangements so that the Post Office Account
is able to survive any IT related disaster without major financial loss or damage to its reputation.

11.2. APPROPRIATE PLANS

11.2.1 Business Continuity Planning Process

Plans for the continuation of business processes and operations in the event of the destruction or
unavailability of information systems, networks, accommodation, communications and business
resources will be developed and maintained. Guidelines and support should be provided by members
of the Business Continuity Planning team to ensure consistency of plan development and a co-
ordinated approach across the Post Office Account. The business continuity planning process will
cover the following:

¢ Identification and prioritisation of business processes

* Determination of the potential impact upon the business process of various major incidents
and disaster scenarios.

¢ Identification and agreement of all responsibilities and emergency arrangements
¢ Documentation of agreed procedures, processes and re-instatement timescales.
e Education of staff in the execution of plans

¢ Exercising of plans

¢ Maintenance of Plans
11.3, CONSISTENT PLANS

11.3.1 BCP Framework
A single framework of plans will be maintained to:

« Ensure that all levels of plans are consistent.

« Identify priorities for testing and maintenance.
There will be three main components to this framework:

« Emergency procedures describing the immediate actions to be taken following a major
incident in order to protect human life and business processes.

e Fallback Procedures describing the actions to be taken to provide continuity of service
without normal IT facilities, accommodation, personnel and communications.

POL00401642

Ref: RS/POL/002
FUJITSU Horizon Security Policy Version: 11.0
FUJITSU SERVICES
Commercial in Confidence Date: 24-Feb-2006

¢ Contingency procedures describing the actions to be taken to move business activities and
support services to alternate facilities.

The business impact analysis will identify the maximum elapsed time that individual services,
processes or operations may be unavailable, following some form of major incident, before the Post
Office Account suffers significant harm.

The BCP plan will then specify how the services, processes and operations are to be reinstated to an
acceptable level within defined time scales. The BCP and business recovery plans will state:

© Individual responsibilities
¢ Emergency procedures which describe the invocation process following a major incident

e Fallback procedures which describe the action required to move essential services and
personnel to alternative temporary locations

¢ Resumption procedures to describe the actions required to return to full normal service .
e An exercise schedule which specifies how and when the plan will be exercised

« The contingency arrangements and facilities that are available and how these are to be used.
* The main resources to be covered will include:

e Buildings and accommodation

¢ Personnel

© Computer Hardware

* Computer software and applications

© Data, whether held on magnetic or other media

¢ Terminals

¢ Voice or Data communications and networks

* Manual processes which depend on or support IT functions

¢ Critical non IT records

Business function plans will be developed in conjunction with specialist business functions (e.g.
Personnel, Premises etc.) Where there are dependencies on areas outside of the department, these will
be identified and appropriate requirements passed to the other party to ensure that the plan is cohesive
and feasible. Interdependencies will be co-ordinated by the Business Continuity Planning team to
ensure availability.

For critical (essential, important or time critical) activities and services which must be continued,
continuity plans must detail how and whether alternative (and possibly less efficient) practices are to
be followed to mitigate adverse business impacts. Plans will detail resource requirements to restore
both reduced and full capabilities. Plans will rank customers and service providers by order of
priority to optimise usage of the limited resources available.

Non critical services where recovery can be delayed will be listed, and agreed.

11.4 IMPLEMENTATION

Line managers, with the help and advice of the Business Continuity Planning team, are responsible for
ensuring that appropriate plans are developed, implemented and maintained within their business
divisions.

Suppliers of IT services must comply with the Post Office Account BCP requirements. Contract
terms and conditions should specify suppliers’ obligations in this respect.
11.5 SAFEGUARDING KEY PERSONNEL

Key personnel will be identified. Plans will cover the possibility that such key individuals may be
unavailable and provide for alternatives. Travel arrangements should limit the number of key
personnel travelling together.

11.6 EXERCISING OF PLANS

11.6.1 Responsibilities
Business function plan owners are responsible to line management for:
« The definition of the scope and objectives of all tests
e Frequency of exercises
¢ Evaluation of exercises
¢ Preparation and execution of contingency exercises
© Co-ordination of updates to plans.

Such exercises will be planned to minimise the impact of the business, whilst ensuring individual
components of the plan are exercised in accordance with the value of the assets being exercised.

The Business Continuity Planning Team will be involved and co-ordinate all exercising of ECT
business function and service recovery plans.
11.7 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS

The exercising process must incorporate a mechanism to identify errors or omissions in the plans and
for these to be investigated and where appropriate the plans updated. This will be co-ordinated by the
Business Continuity Planning Team.

11.8 UPDATING OF PLANS

11.8.1 Regular Updates

Business function, BCP and Service Recovery plans can quickly become out of date because of
changes to the business or organisation and must be subject to regular updates. Examples of changes
which may necessitate updating of plans include:

© Acquisition of new equipment
¢ Upgrading of operational systems
© Staff or organisational changes

° Change of contractors or suppliers

* In the event of changes to the LiNK Security Standards Post Office Account will review the
LiNK Standards to identify any change in requirements

12.9.1 Other Legislation

The Post Office Account is obliged to comply with all legislation passed into law by the government
of the United Kingdom and is committed to best practices to ensure the security and safety of its
information. Regulatory and Legislative policies with which the Post Office Account will comply
include:

¢ BS ISO/IEC 17799 A Code of Practice for Information Security Management
© Companies Act 1989

12.9.2 Regular Reviews

All areas of the Post Office Account will be subject to regular reviews to ensure compliance with
security policy and standards together with all regulatory and legislative requirements. These may be
carried out by the Security Manager, the programme Assurance Manager or External organisations
who have a statutory right of access to information.

12.10 SYSTEM AUDITS

12.10.1 Requirements

Audit requirements including the scope of checks will be agreed and controlled with the appropriate
management agreement; checks must be limited to read only access of the software and data. The
resources required for system audits must be explicitly identified and made available. Care must be
exercised to ensure the minimum risk of disruption to services.

Requirements for special or additional processing must be identified and agreed with the service
providers. System audit access must be monitored and logged to produce an audit trail.

12.10.2 Technical Compliance Checking

Information systems should be regularly checked for compliance with security implementation
standards. Technical compliance checking involves the examination of operational systems to ensure
that hardware and software controls have been correctly implemented. This type of compliance
checking requires specialist technical assistance. It should be performed manually (supported by
appropriate software tools, if necessary) by an experienced system engineer, or by an automated
software package which generates a technical report for subsequent interpretation by a technical
specialist.

Compliance checking also covers, for example, penetration testing, which might be carried out by
independent experts specifically contracted for this purpose. This can be useful in detecting

foe) Ref: RS/POL/002
FUJITSU Horizon Security Policy Version: 11.0
FUJITSU SERVICES
Commercial in Confidence Date: 24-Feb-2006

vulnerabilities in the system and for checking how effective the controls are in preventing
unauthorized access due to these vulnerabilities. Caution should be exercised in case success of a
penetration test could lead to a compromise of the security of the system and inadvertently exploit
other vulnerabilities.

Any technical compliance check should only be carried out by, or under the supervision of,
competent, persons authorised by the Post Office Account Security Manager.

12.10.3 System Audit Tools

Access to system audit tools, e.g. software or data files, must be safeguarded to prevent any possible
misuse or compromise. Audit tools must be separated from development and operational systems,
and not held in tape libraries or other general access areas unless given an additional level of security
protection.

13: WAIVERS, EXCEPTIONS AND VARIATIONS

13.11.1 Issue

It is expected that the Post Office Account Information Security Standards and Codes of Practice will
be adhered to, however, it is recognised that technology or circumstances may make compliance
impractical in a limited number of instances. A waiver process has been developed to deal with these
instances. Where compliance cannot be practically achieved a waiver must be requested.

A waiver can be requested by the project manager, and agreement to proceed obtained from the
nominated system owner with agreement also being sought from the Security Manager. Once agreed
the waiver will be lodged with the Security Manager, who will then ensure that they are reviewed
regular basis.

This should be viewed as a temporary measure, therefore should the conditions which gave rise to the
waiver change; there is still a requirement to adhere to standards irrespective of the existence of a
valid waiver.

13.11.2 Additional Measures

Compensatory measures must be put in place to minimise the impact of any failure to comply
with the Security Policy and Standards. Plans must be developed to reduce or remove as
quickly as possible the need for such waivers, exceptions and variations to policy.
