We could, however, respond with something like this (just so Cs cannot say we ignored their letter):
“We have responded fully to your letter of yesterday. We have nothing to add.”

Dear All

Please find attached Freeths' response to our letter of last night. The back correspondence is also attached.
They are planning to "proceed on the basis that you will not be relying on any parts of the Judgment to
which you have not expressly referred in Parsons 15" unless we tell them otherwise by Ilam and may seek a
hearing with the Judge to discuss this matter and delay the recusal hearing.

Thoughts and comments welcomed.

Kind regards

Amy
