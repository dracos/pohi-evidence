. My initial training for joining NBSC consisted of a counter training course and 2
weeks of classroom training. We were then set up in a nursey team with full

support.

. When taking calls, we relied on a system called the knowledge base which held
a massive amount of useful information. We didn’t really need to use the
Horizon system. Our calls tended to be the more complex ones that couldn’t be
dealt with at Tier 1 level. We could spend more time helping and getting to the

bottom of any issues raised.

. We had regular training sessions and reading time weekly to keep up with any

new products or changes being made / new process.

. We could support Postmasters by requesting help from the then Retail Line

managers.

. | donot remember any specific requests for help.

. | was not involved in any projects apart from some Horizon system testing in

Felltham. | do not recall any issues raised during this time.

. Calls were varied. Transactional queries and issues with completing weekly and

then monthly balancing were most common. Alongside correcting errors made.

We had processes in place to help as much as we could.
