This document is an addendum to the S80 Release Note detailing those Peaks, which
remain outstanding once $80 has been implemented. This document only includes Peaks
that impact on the counter. Data Centre PinICLs are detailed within document
CS/REN/031

The Peaks were either: -

Peaks which were outstanding at S60, S70 or S75 and had previously been
targeted at S80 or

The Declaration/Correction and Revaluation
UI (EA/IFS/012) states that the Transaction
Correction Check should be the LAST logon
check to be performed. On the first logon on
of the day at a counter it is NOT the last - the
APS Disaster Recovery/Fallback checks are
the last.

Corrections to be the last check, however it is
not essential, as the Corrections are not being
made to APS transactions. If we were to go
ahead with the changes at this stage it would
involve changes to three components, which
could result in further problems, amounting to
instability.

To avoid large-scale reference data

been introduced. For example, the 'Mobile E

If a Transaction Correction fails to process at

misleading and would probably be reported to
NBSC by the Post Master when he called with
the reference number for the failed TC.

visible to the PM and since it is only used for
when he is going to call NBSC as long as the

cause an issue.

stack

In the course of testing it has been found that
session transfer with Track and Trace items on
the stack is taking longer than does session
transfer with non-Track and Trace items on
the stack. The length of time it takes has
varied - on some occasions it has been almost
as quick (a few seconds) as a session transfer
with non-track and trace items but on other
occasions it has taken as much as 3 and a half
minutes.

concluded the following:

i) All session transfers are thought to be
slower within 2 migration windows:

(1) From Counter Roll-out (Point 20) until
the end of the CAP when the CBDB is
switched off

(2) The last CAP until the first TP inclusive

(ii) However transfers with mails transactions
appear to be taking significantly longer at S80
compared with S75.

As T&T is only in pilot until post $90, it is
likely that this problem will not be an issue for
the bulk of the estate.

Part (i) we can’t do anything about - it is
believed to be only a problem during S80 CAP
to TP migration. So the recommendation is
that we publish a KEL.

Part (ii) is under investigation with Escher.
Component showing problem is Escher

desktop, so a fix at S80 is unrealistic. If an
Escher fix is identified and can be supplied

Update: PO Ltd has requested that this be
fixed at S80. The peak has been further
discussed by design and development and both
are strongly of the opinion that to make such a
change at this point would carry considerable
risk. Currently, the reversal receipt is a generic
session receipt (i.e. it is already different from
the Rem and Transfer receipts). This is
because 'reversal' is also a generic function
(used for all modes). To accommodate the
change, reversal functions and receipts that are
specific to Rems and Transfers would have to
be developed. If a change is required then the
details need to be agreed between FS and
POL.

suspected that the rig set up on E2E has
contributed to the problem occurring and there
is no reason to believe that live will see any
more instances once at S80.

As stated above the underlying cause would
require an Escher delivery. This would not be
available for S80 or S80R. Development will
continue to investigate to identify whether a
‘work round' change could be made in our

S80D EMV: Retail card with invalid LUHN

When a card fails the LUHN check, the
customer is still asked to enter a PIN, before
the error is reported to the clerk. This is
different behaviour to pre-S80.

This change in behaviour is thought to have
occurred between the 557 (S70) and the 560
(S75) versions of the PINPad.

It is an unlikely occurrence (corrupt card or
hardware problem) and the error is handled
cleanly if it ever should occur.

The PEAK will be treated as a low priority
Hypercom problem for further investigation at
S90. We recommend that this PEAK should
be deferred until a later release.
