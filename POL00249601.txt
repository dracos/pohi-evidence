Hi Paula,

This is v unfortunate. I've now personally reviewed this and there are 2 more opportunities that have been
identified: a Londis and a non symbol independent. We are visiting them tomorrow and will update then.

We have been and are using the new pitch pack.

We can offer HNGa but this could throw doubt on the integrity of HNGx. We took the prospective pmr to meet
and speak to other pmrs who were positive about the local model and the integrity of Horizon. However, 2 of
the 3 brothers who are owners of the store believed that running a PO still presented too big a risk (including

space issues and who would run it).

Regards,
Kevin

Thanks.

Kevin, this sounds v tough - are we deploying the sales narrative which is used for multiples?
Do you think it would be helpful to ask Margot to help find one?

Also how might we reassure re Horizon - we could offer the new HNGA system?

Dear all,
The update on Quarry from Neil Ennis is:

2 PNOs have expressed interest but pulled out (the second one because of concerns
around Horizon unfortunately) and there are no other applicants in the pipeline currently.
As before they will continue to try to secure a PNO but to set expectations Karl’s field team
have already visited every potential site so there is no easy solution. (note to us: To put
this into context of how hard it is to find PNOs there are over 400 NT branches with no
interest that we are working on still in NT as we close out the programme.)

Paula — rather than send an email, Jane’s team will reach out to the person in Margot’s
office to explain the situation. We can also suggest to them if they have any local influence
then we would be happy to hear from any prospects. Does that sound ok?

Dear all,

I’ve just had a call from Margot James parliamentary office enquiring about the status of
the new Post Office in Quarry Bank. They mentioned Margot would love to open it, if

diaries/timings allow.
V’ve asked Kevin's office to provide an update so we can go back to them.
Paula — would you like the update to come from you?
