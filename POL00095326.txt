Introduction

As Security Managers, the normal practice is to investigate and
prosecute offenders without having to resort to arrest.

However, occasionally you will have to effect an arrest when you are
sure the circumstances make arrest lawful and there is no other
reasonable way to pursue the inquiry, but itis important that such

Section 1: Arrestable Offences

ES What Constitutes an Arrest?
ES In general, an arrest is defined as the physical seizure or touching of
I the arrested person's body with a view to histher detention, but there
ES may also be an arrest by mere words, e.g. simply by telling them they
ES are under arrest.
Ea Before you can use your powers of arrest it is vital that you firstly
obtain a sound understanding of what constitutes an “Arrestable
es Offence”.
ea Section 24 (Subsections 1-3) ofthe Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984 (PACE) defines Arrestable Offences as follows:
bl Section 24 {1a}
ga
Offences for which the sentence is fixed by law, e.
Es life imprisonment for murder.
ea
Section 24 {ib}
Ea
Ea Offences for which a person of 21 years of age or over
(not previously convicted) may be sentenced to imprisonment
Ea ‘for a term of five years or more, eg. theft, robbery, burglary,
obtaining property or services by deception, handling stolen
Ea ‘goods (you should note that the offence is arrestable and
Ea therefore the age of the offender is immaterial)
Ea Section 24 (2)

Offences which have been deemed arrestable by Statute,
including taking a motor vehicle without consent, going
equipped to steal, harassment, racially-aggravated
harassment, having a bladed article or point in a public
place, carrying an offensive weapon, and Section 1 of the
Protection of Children Act 1978 (indecent photographs
and pseudo photographs of children).

Section 24 (3)

Attempting, conspiring, inciting, aiding, abetting, counselling
or procuring any offence detailed in subsection 2 above.

Section 1: Arre Section 1: Arrestable Offences

So as you can see, there are four main categories of Arrestable
Offences.

‘The first category (Subsection 1a) is self-explanatory and in any
event you will not be called upon to investigate such offences.

‘The second category (Subsection 1b) can sometimes be difficult to
understand as it may seem that only people over 21 can be arrested.

is is not so, what it is saying is that if @ person was found guilty at
court of that offence, and they were over 21, they could be sentenced
to 5 years ot more. Therefore it is the offence which is arrestable, e.g.
theft, and the age of the offender is immaterial. You should also note

‘An easy way to remember the above is by using the acronym

S.0.D.A. which is explained below:

S _—Sentence fixed by law.

O ~ Offences for which a person of 21 years of age ot over
(not previously convicted) may be sentenced to imprisonment
for a term of five years or more,

D_~Deemed arrestable by Statute.

A. ~Attempting, conspiring, inciting, aiding, abetting, counselling
or procuring,

that if the offences covered by this subsection are “attempted”, they
are again arrestable.

‘The third category (Subsection 2) refers to offences deemed
arrestable by Statute. This simply means that the Statute Law, e.g.
the Theft Act 1968, has stated that certain offences are arrestable.
‘An example of this is going equipped to steal, contrary to Section 25
of the Theft Act 1968

Now read Section 25 of the Theft Act 1968.

‘You will see that Subsection 4 of Section 25 states that:

" Section 25 (4) of the Theft Act 1968

“Any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is, or
on whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects to be, committing

READING an offence under this Section.”

‘Therefore it is an arrestable offence deemed by Statute,

‘The fourth category (Subsection 3) is self-explanatory.

Section 2: Citi

All people have powers of arrest (more commonly known as
Citizens’ powers of arrest) and this section focuses on what these
powers are.

‘The rules regarding Citizens’ powers of arrest are clearly defined
within PACE, Section 24, Subsections (4) and (5). These rules
obviously relate to us as Security Managers, but Police Constables are
citizens as well, and as such they also have these powers of arrest.

Let's look at what PACE says in more detail,

Section 24 (4)
Any person may arrest without warrant:

@) anyone who is in the act of committing an arrestable
offence;

b) anyone whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting
10 be committing such an offence.

‘The most important thing to remember about Section 24 (4) is that
‘you have to believe that the offence is actually being committed at
the time of the arrest.

Section 24 (5)

Where an arrestable offence has been committed any person
‘may arrest without warrant:

@) anyone who is guilty of the offence;

b) anyone whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting
I to be guilty of it.

With Section 24 (5) the most important line is “Where an arrestable
offence has been committed”, You have to know an arrestable
offence has been committed before you can make an arrest.
Once you know that an arrestable offence has been committed it
‘only then that you can arrest anyone who is guilty of it, or anyone
‘you have reasonable grounds to suspect of being guilty of it.

‘The point above cannot be stressed strongly enough. The fact is if it
later turns out that an arrestable offence has not been committed, for
example in a Service Delivery case, when a test letter tums up a few
days later, or ina Post Office Network case when an error notice
‘comes to light to explain the loss, and these were the arrestable
offerices that you were relying on, the arrest will be unlawful, even if
it was made in good faith. You will be responsible for the unlawful
arrest.

Consider the following Case Studies and then answer the questions
that follow:

You are investigating a Delivery Officer who is suspected of having
a number of stolen items of mail at his home. During the interview
‘you recover a “test” item and the Delivery Officer admits that he has
stolen it

He has refused a request to allow a search of his home to be carried

Extra powers of arrest for Constables are contained within PACE,
Section 24, Subsections (6) and (7). You need to be aware of these
powers as you may need the assistance of the Police during your
inquiries. This section focuses on what these powers are, Let’s look at
what PACE says about Police Constable’s powers of arrest in more
detail,

Where a Constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting
that an arrestable offence has been committed, he may
arrest without a warrant anyone whom he has reasonable
grounds for suspecting to be guilty of the offence.

‘As you can see the Police have “two bites of the cherry” when it
comes to reasonable grounds in Section 24 (6).

Security Managers have fo know an arrestable offence has been
committed (in accordance with Section 24 (5)) but a Police Constable
only has to have reasonable grounds to suspect that an arrestable
offence has been committed (in accordance with Section 24 (6)).

Section 3: /

Powers of Arrest

ahle’s Powers of Arrest

Section 24 (Subsection 7) states:

Section 24 (7)

A Constable may arrest without warrant:

4) anyone who is about to commit an arrestable offence;

‘b) anyone whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting
10 be about to commit an arrestable offence.

As you can see, Section 24 (Subsection 7) allows a Police Constable
with reasonable grounds to effect an arrest before an arrestable
offence is actually committed.

Security Managers on the other hand, have to wait until they have
reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is actually committing,
an arrestable offence (in accordance with Section 24 (4)).

PACE also gives Police Constables extra powers of arrest under
Section 25. This section pertains to “General arrest conditions” for
non-arrestable offences. The most important condition that you
should be aware of is that a Constable can arrest for a non-arrestable
offence if he believes that a person will do physical injury to
themselves. You should bear this in mind if you are faced with an
offender for a non-arrestable offence and you believe that he may
attempt suicide. If this is the case contact the Police.

‘they are under arrest;

‘The arrested person should then be formally cautioned and a note

made in your Notebook (there are separate Training Modules
covering Cautions and Notebooks)

Ifa suspect does not attempt to resist arrest or attempt to escape,
no force may be used.

Such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of
crime may be used to arrest an offender or suspect, although a person
may be arrested by the use of words alone,

If excessive or unreasonable force is used, the person making
the arrest may be prosecuted for the criminal offence of assault
and/or found liable to pay damages in civil proceedings. This is in
accordance with The Criminal Law Act 1967, Section 3.

Jnlawful Arrest and the Human Rights Act 1998

Unless an arrest is made strictly within the bounds of PACE Sections
24 and 28, the person making the arrest could face a civil action
and/or criminal proceedings for false imprisonment,

This fact is reinforced by the Human Rights Act 1998 (law from
2 October 2000), Article 5, which deals with the right to Liberty

and Security, is reproduced below for you to read. You will note
which arrests are lawful (as Security Managers your arrest should be
in accordance with Paragraph 1c) and the fact that people who
believe they have been unlawfully arrested will be allowed to take
proceedings and if successful they will be entitled to compensation,

Your answer may have included two of the following
reasons where an arrest may be unlawful:

‘+ unless at the time of the arrest (or soon after) the person
is informed that they are under arrest and the grounds of
the arrest;

+ if ithas not been made clear to the arrested person that
they have been arrested and are not free to leave;

+ if the power is not exercised for proper purpose, and the
arresting person knows at the time there is no possibility,
of a charge being made;

+ if sufficiently clear words are not used when the arrest
is made;

+ if reasons given point to an offence for which no power
of arrest is given, and it is clear that no other reasons were
present in the mind of the arresting person;

+ if the grounds for arrest are not reasonable.
QIL. What does a Security Manager have to consider if an

interviewee states they are leaving (or asks what will happen

Powers of Arrest

POL00095326
POL00095326

This module focused on the powers of arrest you have as a Security
‘Manager.

In Section 1 we explored what constitutes an arrestable offence.
In particular we looked at the definitions applied by Section 24
(Subsections 1 - 3) of PACE.

Section 2 looked at the powers of arrest we all have as citizens.
Again, Section 24 (this time Subsections 4 and 5) of PACE defines
‘when a citizen can effect an arrest. We saw that you, as a Security
Manager, can only effect an arrest if you have reasonable grounds to
suspect that an arrestable offence is being committed or, where an
arrestable offence has been committed, you have reasonable grounds
to suspect a particular person.

In Section 3 we dealt with the additional powers Police Officers have
to effect an arrest. These are detailed in Section 24 (Subsections 6
and 7) of PACE, We saw that the Police have the power to arrest if
they have reasonable grounds to suspect an arrestable offence has
‘been committed and they can arrest before an arrestable offence has
been committed, providing they have reasonable grounds to believe
an offence will be committed.

Finally, in Section 4 we looked at the actions required after an arrest
has taken place.
