1 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Summary: Within the Fujitsu Services domain for June 07 there were no Major Incidents, four service affecting
incidents within the Fujitsu domain, 1 incident relating to VIP sites and one further service affecting incident
outside the Fujitsu domain. Details are given in the Incident Overview below.

Exceptional weather conditions has led to increasing call volumes in some areas, a noticeable increase of
branches with services unavailable at the start of each business day and associated difficulties in resolving
some calls. However in each case, those outlets without communications have returned to service and the
number failing has been under the set threshold by 09.15 each morning.

Branch and counter availability continue to remain above target at 99.8% and 99.3% respectively.

90 OBC changes were delivered in the month and all the OBC targets were exceeded with all OLAs met. The
reporting for OBC has been simplified, with joint targets now agreed based on the achievement of opening
times.

The Epson printers are now installed on more than 50% of counters. The number of calls remains high, but the
majority are resolved at the desk. The issue with the print cartridges has been identified by Epson and a
remedial plan is being agreed, focussing on minimising impact to the branches.

Service levels on A priority engineering calls have improved, but C priority performance has declined. Further
work has taken place this month to improve the quality of information passed through to engineers and in
scheduling resource. Discussions are in hand to agree revised targets once all major improvement actions have
been implemented.

A total of 106 complaints were received. Under the revised complaints process, most of these are now passed
through to Fujitsu for investigation and comment to ensure all corrective actions are captured and implemented.
Hence the total for investigation was 77, with 38 justified.

2 Incident Overview

Summary: Within the Fujitsu Services domain for June 2007 there were no Major Incidents.
There were 4 further service affecting incidents within the Fujitsu domain.

There was 1 incident affecting a VIP site.
There was 1 further service affecting incident outside of the Fujitsu domain.

NB. We have experienced in the month of June a season of storms. With major
downpours and areas of major flooding, there have been a greater number of
branches that have suffered enforced closures. Due also to power failures and
bad weather conditions there has been a noticeable increase of branches with
services unavailable at the start of each business day (08:00). However in each
case, those outlets without communications have returned to service and the
number failing has been under the set threshold by 09.15 each morning.

Major Incidents: None

Other incidents in Fujitsu Thursday 14" June. There was a router issue within the BT satellite domain at

Services domain: 04:18 affecting all the 60 VSAT outlets (Call E -0706140003 refers). BT instigated
a repair and a return to service started at 09:30. By 10:15 the number affected
was under threshold and the total VSAT estate was back on-line by 12:00. BT
(SkyLogic) told us that an unknown third party was transmitting on the same
frequency timeslot as their D-Star VSAT service. Apparently this can be caused
by, miss-configuration, malfunction, or malicious third party equipment.

Monday 48" June. There was an incident within the C&W ISDN domain causing
on-line transactions to time out at 137 branches, from 14:20 to 15:20. A fault
existed and then resolved within the C&W core network. This was delaying
transactions to 30 seconds and causing timeouts at the counter. Call E-
0706181000 refers. C&W investigated but could not identify any cause for this
incident within their domain.

Tuesday 19" June. Total loss of the VSAT network of 60 branches (8 are
closed) at 10:10 due to an RF Interference incident at the BT base station in
Turin (Italy). BT restored service at 13:40 to the VSAT network, and by 14:46
service restored to all the VSAT connected branches by 14:46. Call E-
0706190371 refers. BT reported that the failure was a RF Bandwidth
Management fault which was rectified.

Wednesday 20" June. A total loss of the VSAT network of 60 branches (8 are
closed) at 17:27 due to a major storm in Turin (Italy) and loss of connectivity at
the BT base station. BT restored service at 18:57. Call E-0706200979 refers.
VIP sites affected this Saturday 23 June. The House of Commons, VIP site, 003011 lost On-line
month: services at 13:38, due to power failure. Engineer to site on Monday morning, due
to traffic & parking issues arrived on site at 11:00. Gateway replaced and branch
working from 13:30. Call E-0706230271 refers.

Incidents that were outside Monday 25" June. There was a higher than normal number of VSAT connected
the Fujitsu Domain: sites 22 that had lost on-line services over the weekend. This was due to storms,
but all had re-connected by 09:15. Call E-0706250056 refers.

3 Business Continuity

3.1 Business Continuity Testing
Over the week-end of the 15" to 18" of June test 2, the data-centre failover, was successfully conducted.
On Sunday 4s of July test 12, the System Management Centre test, was successfully conducted.

On Wednesday and Thursday 4th and 5" of July the Outlet Change Management Service operational test was
successfully conducted.

3.2 Forthcoming Testing
During July procedural walk-throughs are planned for the Database Server, test 3, and Reference Data, test 9.

An operational test is planned for test 7, the Generic Agent, for Sunday 22" of July.

3.3 Business Continuity Planning

During June further progress was made on developing the HNG-X Business Continuity Framework and the HNG-
X Operational Test Plans and initial copies have been produced. Work also continued on writing the HNG-X
changes for the Business Continuity Plans.

3.4 Business Continuity Incidents and Issues

No Major Business Continuity Incidents were raised during June.

Some progress was made on the implementation and commissioning of the LST rig in the LEW02 Disaster
Recovery site during June. The LST commissioning phase is expected to be completed either later this month
(July) or during August.

The operational test for the loss of Bracknell 01, i.e., the relocation to LEW02, is therefore being postponed until
later in the year.

4 Complaints

During June, there were 128 complaints logged about Fujitsu Services, with 77 standard complaints passed to Fujitsu for
formal investigation. Of these, 38 complaints were considered justified, with 3 outstanding as they are awaiting resolution
before a Justified/Unjustified decision is made. Complaints about Fujitsu Services account for 26.2% of all complaints
received at the NBSC during June. The overall volume of complaints logged against Fujitsu Services has increased this
month, however comparisons of the volume of justified complaints cannot be made, due to the process change.

As the process has changed this month, details of all justified complaints are available in a separate spreadsheet and remedial
actions are added to the CSIP register and discussed at the relevant ORFs

Commentary

Engineer Complaints: There was an increase in Engineering Complaints, including 21 around online services. The majority
of complaints were caused by missed engineer ETAs where the expectation had not been met. Work is underway to improve
the system of providing ETAs.

We had a small number of complaints relating to the quality of the refurbished Ithaca printers. The Epson printer rollout
programme continues to replace the Ithaca printers and progress is continuing according to schedule. To date 17716 new
printers have been installed, which equates to 50.62% of the printers in the estate. Despite the fact that the number of Epson
calls into the desk remains high, the number of related engineering visits remains low. In relation to the blank printing problem,
Epson have redesigned the ink cartridge to enable a more pressurised cleaning cycle which they believe will resolve the
problem.

HSD: There were 7 justified complaints to the HSD. The main issues were 3 require refresher training of HSD staff and 3
require a BIM visit in relation to Printer malfunctions.

Online Services: There were 6 justified complaints against online services. The main issue was BT having intermittent faults.
Unfortunately these are often difficult to trap and can last several days.

5 Service Summary

5.1 Horizon Service Desk

The HSD saw a slight increase in the number of calls from Post Office Branches logged during June, with 16,123 calls logged
at the desk, compared with 15,852 during May. This figure is on par with the average of the last 9 months, although slightly
higher than recent months. This would have been due to the severe weather across the UK (flooding and lightning strikes) that
caused an increase in Hardware Calls.

- Network Calls continue at their normal level.
- Hardware Calls show a slight increase.

5.2 Engineering Service
June 07 has seen call volumes again finish under 6,000 with 700 A Priority calls in this period.

As the Epson roll-out continues to gather momentum, the number of engineering visits for the office counter
printers (Epson & Ithaca combined) continues to decrease.

Compared to May, June has seen an improvement in A priority SLT conformance, and a slight decrease in C
priority conformance. The A priority calls fixed within four hours rose from 74.8% to 80.4%, whilst A priorities
resolved within six hours also improved to 88.1% from 86.8%. Conformance on C priority next day calls showed
final figures of 91.3%, a decrease of 4.4% on the previous month which came in at 95.7%. Next Day +2 hours on
C priorities reached 92.2% conformance after being 96.2% in May.

Base unit builds again prove to be the highest single point of failure when we attend A priority calls. We have
improved the time taken to get engineers to site for the four hour call to fix. However the main problem in hitting
the SLT lies with the time taken on site which obviously includes various attempts to solve the problem before kit
is swapped out.

The reduction in C priority conformance was due to a number of contributing factors. There was an increase in
fail on fits, especially Ithaca counter printers (currently under investigation). This would increase the time the
engineer spends on site, and could subsequently impact calls allocated for later in the day- and it is not always
the case that the spare part is in the engineer's buffer stock. The counter printer calls continue to be monitored as
part of the Sense and Respond project. The extreme weather had an indirect effect on engineering ability to
reach calls. In addition to this, a proportion of directly affected failed calls were not fed into the exclusion lists. The
process is currently under review, to ensure that we are more efficient should this happen again.

We continue to analyse failure points and built improvements upon them. The engineering desk has been
reorganised, and a new resource manager employed. A successful innovation forum was held between desk staff
including MACs, and engineers to discuss possible areas of improvement.

June has again seen all counter availability targets met, with all conformances in excess of 99%

5.3. Branch Network Services / Central Network

5.3.1. Branch Network Services
During May there were 1,177 calls logged across all Network Types into the HSD.

SLT's

The ‘Priority A - 6 hours’ SLT saw 28 failures from a total of 1140 closed calls measured, resulting in 97.5%
achievement. A contributing factor to the SLT conformance miss can be attributed to volume of incidents that
require investigation outside of the Incident Management process, thus requiring extensive investigation from
Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd.

Other issues in June
In previous months we have been reporting a higher then expect fall out rate from the IP Migration activity. This
activity has now almost completed with 2 Branches left to migrate.

During the last month we have become aware of a problem with the VSAT solution. This is currently being
addressed with assistance from Core ISP/BT.

June also saw a higher then expected number of faults logged due to adverse weather conditions in some cases
resulting in flooding which impacted our and BT’s ability to resolve within SLT.

5.3.2 Central Network

This month the HSD network incident volumes were impacted by a C&W ISDN incident on Monday 18 June and
several BT VSAT incidents at the Skylogic base station in Turin (Italy). The ADSL IPStream service and
datacentre LAN services were extremely stable.

Falmouth (236555) — ISDN Line Plant delayed provision

Corrective Actions
ISDN provisions are now ordered 44 working days in advance where possible instead of the normal 22 days. This
allows for identification of Line Plant earlier thus giving an additional period for Line Plant to be resolved before
the Open to Public date.

7 Sense & Respond

Due to the timescales around production of the Sense & Respond data and analysis, the information in the SRB
will always be for the previous month. The full Sense & Respond report is issued separately.

The data captured during May has highlighted the top 2 highest demand types as being Hardware and Software.
Trend analysis has shown an increase in total call volumes for both Hardware (+1041) and Software (+125) from
April to May.

During May, the HSD fixed 64.6% of calls received (11809) and this was an increase of 2% of total calls from
April.

For networking calls, a focus has been made to track ADSL and ISDN call volumes and the mean time to clear.
Trending has highlighted a decrease in call volume from April to May for both ASDL (-68) and ISDN (-369) calls.

The restructuring of CMT has helped to increase call ownership across the team. The mean time to clear of
network calls will be monitored over the upcoming months to understand the impact of this change.

A knowledge base tool created by CMT is currently being merged with a training tool designed by the Reuters
service desk. The aim of this project is to create a training knowledge tool which can be tailored to support all
frontline teams with appropriate knowledge to resolve PM issues. The training aspect will help the managers
identify training needs across the desk.

For Pin Pad errors, revised HSD KELs from Hypercom have been communicated to frontline to help with Pin Pad
diagnostics/fixes.

Due to a high number of no fault found parts being returned to Hypercom repairs, HSD will now be advising
engineers to attempt a re-installation of the Pin Pad before swapping it out.

For hardware demand, the highest call volume received is Counter Printer faults (approximately 4550 calls
received in May). Unfortunately the weekly Epson call rate is now higher than the Ithica per 100 printers and we
are receiving Epson calls spikes every Monday. More positively, the HSD are resolving the majority on frontline
and this has helped increase our FTFR this month.

Another area of focus is regarding chase calls. There are a number of sites who have made a number of repeat
calls for incidences they have logged, however, the PM continues to log repeat calls even with updates provided.
We have an opportunity of saving 10% if these site calls are reduced. Further work is needed on this issue and
will be discussed with the Post Office during June.

The focus on software errors will be suspended due to the belief that many of the software issues will be resolved
once HNG-X is rolled out. The project will be revisited after the roll out to understand the impact on software
errors.

An additional objective regarding engineering calls is to reduce the amount of calls to HSD from Touch, Fujitsu
and ROMEC engineers. Engineering call volumes have decreased during May (-652) and we will be monitoring
June's data to see if the trend continues.

With the pilot of using multiple ‘plus’ signs to break up the block text that Clientele receives at TOUCH, it is hoped
this will continue to drive down the number of engineering calls.

A project monitoring Inappropriate calls between the HSD and NBSC desks have achieved is objective of
reducing the number of calls between the desks from 10% to 5%. The team will continue to monitor the
inappropriate call volumes and ensure monthly communication is maintained between the HSD and NBSC desks.
