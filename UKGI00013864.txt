Dear

Thank you for your further letter in response to mine of 30 March. As you will have
seen from my letter of 14 May, your letter of 25 April did in fact reach me, and my
reply crossed with your latest letter of 15 May.

I do not think there is much I can usefully add to my previous letter. With regard to
your point about Mrs Wolstenholme have Horizon transactual logs showing
hundreds of calls made in the February-April period, I would suggest that she
copies them to Eric Logan. In the letter from Alan Johnson, Minister for
Competitiveness, to your MP, Mrs Humble, the reference was to 13 Helpdesk calls
between June and November. With regard to making representations to Eric
Logan, my understanding is that Elaine Tagg advised Mrs Wolstenholme that she
could do this in a letter dated 14 February 2001.

I am not qualified to advise on legal matters, so your daughter would need to take

legal advice about the scope for taking any case to the European Court of Human
Rights.

Yours sincerely

Mike Whitehead
Postal Services Directorate
