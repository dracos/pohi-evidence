Byfleet de 6NG Code

Details of visit I This branch was visited on the 10,178&22/8/05 regarding
balancing issues and the setting up of individual stock
units. I have spent many hours sorting out balancing
issues and helping with the stock set up as well as
arranging Ad-hoc training.

The Spmr is still new and is looking for support on many
issues- she has the capability but needs occasional
guidance

This branch is currently holding a loss of £466.73 and an
over of £96.80 that was put into the suspence account by
the trainer ‘Michael’. Who told the Spmr that a voucher
would be issued to clear it. I have spoken to Michael who
confirmed that he did this. I have warned the Spmr that
unless an error comes back they could be liable.
