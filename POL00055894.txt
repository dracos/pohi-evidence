I thought that your barrister on the case of Misra would have copies everything which he considered to be
relevant from the time he spend two days here. I only have e- mail folders on lotus notes in so far as they
can be retrieved and on Outlook but you are welcome to come over and search them.

The boxes containing the papers cost £40 a box to get back from Iron Mountain.

There are numerous boxes in respect of Castleton most of which are still with Stephen Dilley of Bond
Pearce who can let you know how much it would costs to retrieve them from their storage facility.

There are ongoing cases every month which raise the issue of Horizon so it's a moveable feast.

1am endeavouring to pull together a list of those cases currently with us where allegations have been
made in respect of Horizon. Most of these have been on hold awaiting the decision on Misra. The
transcript of that case in now being created and should be with us shortly, so that will assist with the civil
actions.

Regards
