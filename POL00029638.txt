Simon,

I've found some details on the problem. It is described in Peak
PCO126376 (and others).

It was first raised in September 2005. The fix was applied as part of S90
which was rolled out February / March 2006.

The root cause of the issue was that data {ie transactions} was not being
copied correctly between counters in certain circumstances, so
transactions or transfers carried out on one counter were not visible on
reports produced on another counter in the same branch. The
avoidance was to restart the failing counter (which happened
automatically at about 3am each day}, at which point all the missing
transactions were successfully copied. The problem in business terms
was that due to the transactions not being visible, SMPRs considered
that they had not been input and so re-input the transactions thus
ending up with duplicate transactions and so when the originals came
through the following day, the accounts would be in a mess. [In
particular if a Transfer of cash / stock was accepted more than once on
different counters then that would result in a Receipts / Payments
mismatch when the Stock Unit was next Balanced.

We reported the problem to POL, but | don't know how much of an
investigation was carried out into the scope and the number of affected
braches. | was not involved in the issue at the time and only really
become aware of it a part of the Misra case in 2010.

This problem was evidenced by a large number of events in the event
logs. | remember searching through the event logs for the Misra case

with the Defence Expert to show that there was no such pattern of
events in the Misra logs.

These events were visible to our 2” line support staff and there were
instructions for them to phone the affected branch and recommend
that they rebooted the affected counter if such events were seen.

Regards

Gareth
