Hi Jane, i hope day 2 is going well ... iam picking up more and more concerns around the
bungled handling of the transition of Intelligent Resourcing to Morsons....as our providers of
contractors...i wonder if you could have a look at this over the coming week...perhaps chat with
Zdravko, internal audit, HR colleagues...it seems to be a monumental cock up. thank you
