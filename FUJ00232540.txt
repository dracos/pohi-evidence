2 MARCH REVIEW OF SERVICE

2.1 Management Summary

Following the decision by Fujitsu Services to register a Corporate Red Alert as a result of a number of service outages affecting the Horizon
service, work has now started in earnest to identify those areas where there are potential points of failure either in the technical design of the
system, or within the surrounding processes. This has led to the production of a “Service Resilience and Recovery Catalogue” (SRRC), which
is currently being populated together with the “Service Enhancement Register”. Fujitsu Services will be sharing the content of individual
entries with Post Office Ltd, where it is felt that a full understanding of the business or service impact is required to enable both parties to
either discard the entry as “not required” or to discuss how it might be taken forward and a solution developed and costed.

Following agreement with Post Office Ltd, the Corporate Red Alert was downgraded to Amber Alert status on 6" April 2004, however Fujistu
Services wishes to reaffirm to Post Office Ltd that the focus applied over recent weeks in identifying those areas of weakness etc. will
continue.

There were three notable events during the month:

« On Wednesday 3” March there was a communications outage lasting approximately 2.5hrs between Fujitsu Services and Streamline
preventing a small number of Debit Card settlement transactions from taking place. We believe this, and similar communications
issues to be caused by a mis-match of MID’s & TID’s between Fujitsu Services and Streamline, and this is being investigated as part of
the Corporate Red Alert action plan. However, at this point, the service operating within the Fujitsu Service domain appears to be
working to specification.

¢ On Monday 29" March 65 branches in the South Manchester area were subject to an On Line Services failure following a fire in a BT
service tunnel in Manchester City centre. Service was gradually restored over the following five days as BT engineers repaired the
damaged cables.

¢ During the afternoon of Tuesday 30" March, the mains power to the Wigan data centre was lost however backup power was
instantaneously provided by the UPS and generator.

In the business as usual area, Fujitsu Services is still being hit by a higher than expected volume of calls to the HSH and subsequently in the
number of engineering visits made to live sites. The outcome of the internal Fujitsu Services Engineer Visit Reduction project has now been
published and shared with Post Office Ltd as part of the cross-domain Call Reduction problem. Fujitsu Services believes there are a number
of quick wins to be had by improving the quality of 1* line diagnosis within the HSH and closer supplier management in relation to the quality
of spares within the spares loop. There is however a number of issues surrounding the Back Office Printers where both Fujitsu Services and
Post Office Ltd will need to work closely together if calls are to be reduced and discussion has already commenced in this area.

Fujitsu Services SERVICE REVIEW Ref: CS/PER/050
Date: 14/04/04 Version: 1.0

As a result of the higher than expected number of calls, both the HSH and UKME have failed to reach conformance to SLT in March. Although
UKME’s performance is much improved over February, the Average Time To Repair SLT was not achieved. Similarly, the HSH Abandoned
Call SLT also failed to reach the target. Fujitsu Services wishes to discuss with Post Office how we can move forward against a background
of increased calls to the HSH and the Engineer Services which we believe at this stage are unlikely to fall below the contracted limits.

2.1.1. OBC Branch Change Service Summary

During March 2004, 339 branch changes were completed compared to 278 in February 2004 with the Fujitsu Services failure rate increasing
to 7.96% from 5.76% (2.96% over the 5% target). During March there were 27 failures attributable to Fujitsu:

¢ 8BT line plant issues (Trunch, Warsop Vale, Aveton Gifford, Elsrickle, Newchurch, Forden, Adisham and Craig-y-don)

¢ 6 No telecommunications or installed incorrectly (Chudleigh Knighton, Carsphairn, Whissendine, Chute Standen, Kennoway,

Kingston St Michael and Boswall Drive)

e 5 Faulty hardware (Newchurch, Eggleston (Storage and Service Site), Camberwell Greeen, Saltney Ferry and Monks Road)

e 3 Incorrect dates in OCMS (Kingsbridge, Westerhope and Broughton Astley)

e 2 Engineer attending on incorrect dates (Hornsey Road and Melville Road)

e 1 Software configuration issue (Marchmont Street)

e 1 Horizon equipment damaged in transit (Newchurch)

e 1 ProdList mismatch (Glenholt)

2.1.1.1 Service Improvements Implemented and Highlights

e Fujitsu Services have tabled the proposal for the new service for BT Pre-Survey for ISDN. Fujitsu Services will commence work
ahead of a formal CCN and expect to start 3rd May 2004. In the interim, a joint meeting between both businesses is planned for
15th April 2004 to realign lead times and OBC E2E Processes.

e 24 branches have successfully converted from VSAT to ISDN

e 6 directly managed branches; Tooting, Peckham, Camberwell Green, South Harrow Edgeware and Albany Road have now
converted to Franchise operation.

+ Asuccessful joint meeting regarding unplanned closures was held on 29" March 2004 between POL NIET Central, NBSC and
Fujitsu Services where outline roles and responsibilities were agreed.

2.1.2, ADSL Hardware Rollout

This month 1164 sites have received an ADSL hardware upgrade out of a scheduled 1427 and we are now hitting the 250 - 300 per week
upgrade target. Saturday working is still being utilised to maintain the numbers over and above those required to sustain our beat rate of

Fujitsu Services SERVICE REVIEW Ref: CS/PER/050
Date: 14/04/04 Version: 1.0

1000 ADSL enabled branches per month from April 2004. This beat rate will be increased to between 350 — 400 per week as further engineer
resource becomes available following security vetting.

Joint Post Office Ltd / Fujitsu Services workshops have been held to identify the support processes for ADSL enabled branches. These
processes have now been agreed and implemented with fine-tuning to take place as a result of the ADSL pilot.

The ADSL pilot is now underway with the successful go live of Calthorpe House. We expect to have 29 live pilot sites live after the Easter
weekend.

2.1.3 Icon Service

Icon Batch 2004-01 has now been initiated. This batch contains 10 new icons and is scheduled for release with S60 Counter rollout, with an
estimated start August 2004. Images have been received from Escher and have been sent to Post Office Ltd for approval.

2.1.4 Business Continuity

There were continuing problems with the Debit Card Service during March, and these are being dealt with as part of the Corporate Red Alert.
Two faults have currently been addressed.

1) Streamline and Fujitsu Services MID/TID Databases contained inconsistencies for which Streamline closed the TCP/IP socket
connection.
2) The closing of the TCP/IP socket caused the Authorization Agent to fail. An enhancement has been introduced to eliminate this.

There are remaining faults to be resolved. These include a ‘Bad format’ problem and further suspected X25 communication
inconsistencies/failures.

On Monday the 29th March approximately 65 Branches in the Manchester area were without online services due to the fire in the BT Tunnel.
Only one outlet is now without online services due to this incident.

On the afternoon Tuesday the 30" of March mains power to Wigan Data-centre was lost and power was successfully provided from the UPS
and generator.

The OpTIP, NBE Interface and the initial ADSL operational business continuity tests were successfully conducted during March. A walk-
through of the Alliance & Leicester disaster recovery documentation and processes was also successfully conducted.

2.1.5 Message Broadcast

FUJ00232540

FUJ00232540
Fujitsu Services SERVICE REVIEW Ref: CS/PER/050
Date: 14/04/04 Version: 1.0

Fifty two (52) message broadcasts (MBS) were received for March (MBS054-MBS105). Fujitsu Services Reference Data team highlighted
several issues during March. The email for MBS 058 was sent at 16:32 on 1st March, but the Duty Manager did not get paged until 09:05 on
2nd March. The email was not received on the Fujitsu network until 06:32 on 2nd March.

Several amendments were agreed verbally between Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services over the phone, i.e. changes made to FADs that had
been included and characters corrected.

2.1.6 Complaints

The volume of referred complaints has increased from 26 in February to 27 in March. As with the previous two months, complaints are being
received regarding delays to site within the Engineer Service and instances where online services are unavailable.

The level and nature of complaints received is clearly unacceptable to both Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services. The Engineer Service is
currently subject to a Service Improvement Plan that is being focussed on the need to meet both our service targets and customer
expectations. A review of the provision of the on line service is being undertaken as part of the Corporate Red Alert. These initiatives are
expected to deliver a sharp reduction in the number of complaints received.

2.1.7 Horizon Systems Helpdesk — Logged Call Profile

The number of calls received by the HSH from live Post Office branches has increased by 8.5% this month, with 15153 calls being received
against 13855 in February 2004. It must be noted that there were 3 extra working days in March (25 vs. 22), and this is a contributing factor in
increased call volumes.

Hardware: Up by 11% from 6373 in February 2004 to 7178 this month. The most significant increase this month relates to counter office
printer issues. Counter printer issues account for 547 of the total 805 additional Hardware calls raised this month. The other areas of call
increase were relating to Keyboards, and Monitors, both of which had increases of circa 100 incidents each in the past month. Back Office
printer issues have decreased fro February, but still remain high as a result of the FRTS printout that is produced each morning by the
branches. See Problem PM0000470 for complete analysis of this issue.

Network: Up by 22% from 1142 in February 2004 to 1467 this month. This increase was mainly due to the fire at the Manchester BT
exchange on the 29th of March.

Software: Software results in terms of absolute volumes were almost identical to last month (4041 in March vs. 4003 in ebruary). Taking in to
account the increased working days this month, as well as the ever increasing volume of the on-line services it would seem to show an over
all improved robustness/stability of the Horizon system.

Inappropriate: Up by 9% from 1298 in February 2004 to 1434 this month. While this is an increase in absolute terms, when taking in to
account the extra working day in March it shows that the calls raised per day have actually decreased.

2.1.8 Engineer Services — Site Visits By Engineer

The number of hardware visits undertaken this month was 5337 and included 3617 unit swap-outs. This represents a rise of about 20% over
February, and comes in the context of a 15% rise in the overall number of hardware calls logged to almost 7,200 in March. The trend in
hardware calls continues to rise. The engineer visit reduction project, (as part of the overall cross-domain call reduction problem) instigated
last month has however reported some areas where we can gain some "quick wins". The following measures are being put in place
immediately:

Counter Printers
e the fitting of the paper out sensor clip is suspended until a new clip has been received from the manufacturer and tested. Fujitsu
Services expects to re-commence fitting the new clip w/c 19" April 2004
e the one month trial of a smaller mails label aimed at reducing incidents of labels getting stuck has commenced and is showing positive
results
e engineers will test both receipt and label printing after replacing the printer with immediate effect. This will reduce the instances of calls
being logged shortly after a printer has been replaced where a faulty unit may have been supplied.

Keyboards
e engineers will test all keys on an outgoing and incoming keyboard during a swapout visit
e Fujitsu Services is working with the repairer to remove from the spares loop all units that have been repaired 3 or more times
e Discussions with Post Office Ltd re the sending out of a memoview message to remind users of the correct keyboard keys to use with
the Smart Post application (the enter key is not always enabled in this application)

ADSL visits
e engineers involved in ADSL and PA Testing activities will ensure all cables are properly reconnected

PINPADs
e HSH to improve call scripts to try and diagnose faults and instigate resolutions without calling for an engineer

The earth bonding reconnaissance exercise has been completed early. Two hundred and sixty sites have been identified as needing
supplementary earth bonding to comply with I.E.E. regulations, and it is known that none of these sites is suffering from any earth leakage
and therefore there is no current health and safety concern. Fujitsu Services are expecting a quotation from Romec to carry out the corrective
work and this will be discussed with Post Office Ltd, and a timetable and schedule of works agreed.

The Engineering Service penalties have decreased dramatically this month (circa £24,000). This is a big improvement on February's
penalties and the figures for the latter half of March suggest that further significant progress can be expected in April. Most of the resourcing
issues have been addressed within the engineering teams, and now only South West region continues to experience resourcing issues. All

local, intermediate and remote Service Level Targets for both A and B priority calls were met in March, and the Engineering Service also
achieved at least 97.9% on all penalty thresholds in all categories. The time to repair target was failed however (average 29% of downtime,
against 24.5% of time allowed).

2.1.9 Business Incident Management
There were 15 instances of Receipts and Payments misbalances, the majority due to a fault with Bureau de Change software. A fix for this
has now been developed and due for implementation at S60. In addition there were a number of exceptions on the Network Banking, and E

Top Up Reports. These were wholly attributable to the the Wigan and Bootle agents being rebooted within a 30 minute period of each other
on 21/03/04. No reconciliation was required and customer accounts were unaffected.

2.1.10 Security Services
KMA Key Manager Summary

Automated Key Refresh.

As of 31st March there were 15,950 active post offices, 199 post offices were closed during the month and 38 new post offices rolled out.
The key refresh-smoothing algorithm has selected a total of 1232 branches for refresh this month giving an average figure of 40 branches
being selected each day for key refresh.

Manual Key Refresh

a. The Network Banking ZMK cryptographic key was changed on the 21“ March. Activities were coordinated with IBM and the
successful change was implemented within required time scales.

b. The new TK keys for the NB and DCS servers were successfully extracted from the KMA and installed on the Servers.

c. A new set of resilient VPN keys were generated by the Key Manager and loaded on to the VPN servers at the data centres.
This action closes an action resulting from the VPN Expiry Incident on the 16" Feb.

Key Management Administration

a. The Certificate Authority Workstation in Bracknell which suffered a Hard Disk Drive corruption failure in Feb has been repaired and
is now back in normal operation. This closes an action resulting from the VPN Expiry Incident on the 16" Feb.

Audit Retrieval Queries (Litigation Support)

A total of 53 Old and New Format ARQs were received from Post Office Ltd during the month of March 2004, resulting in a workload of 571
Query Days. This makes the running total for ARQs for January to March 2004 of 142 ARQs totaling 1602 query days, Witness Statements
total 7 and Court Appearances remain at 0.

The upward trend of ARQ requests continues, Graham Ward has been advised of the situation and Security & Risk are maintaining a flexible
approach to the ongoing requirement. However, having analysed the trend it is advised that Post OfficeLtd need to exercise their option to
increase the number of ARQ allowed under the contract, which may result in an increased headcount to provide this service. To remain
within the contracted annual ARQ limits Post Office should restrict the number of ARQs to an average of 27.5 ARQs per month. However,
over the last 3 months Post Office Ltd have used 43% of their annual rolling contractual limit. Two ARQs have also been taken against the
April quota.

Security Administration
No security incidents were reported during March 2004.

Fujitsu Services SERVICE REVIEW Ref: CS/PER/050
Date: 14/04/04 Version: 1.0

Calls for Back Office Printers have risen
since the introduction of Bureau de Change
functionality, which has brought about
increased usage of the printer, particularly
in regard to the printing of the Rates and
Margins reports, which are timed to print
when the Back Office Printers may be
switched off. This is being addressed by
Cross Domain problem PM0000470.

Calls for Ithaca printers have risen due to
the introduction of the printer clip (designed
to disable the paper out sensor). This
modification has caused some printers not
to function, and the implementation of it has
been suspended, pending the introduction
of a better quality clip. Fujitsu Services
expect installation of the new clip to
commence week commencing 19" April.

Keyboard faults continue to remain
unacceptably high. Fujitsu Services is
trialling a number of initiatives, e.g.
instructions to re-boot being given by the
HSH prior to engineer allocation and the
analysis of “no fault found” returns. We
hope to see some reduction in volume over
the coming months.

Management Information
and Service Review

Generally good service but some delay has been
experienced regarding the development of off-line reports,
which are seen as a high priority (and benefit) for both POL
and FS.

FS to manage POL expectations and deliver reports when

Operational Business
Change
Branch

Negatives - The quality of service from Energis/BT is
viewed as generally unimproved. It is felt that POL often
have to chase FS for updates and resolutions that FS
should provide automatically. Evidence that FS are not
learning from past problems i.e. incorrect date entered into
OCMS (Spalding), incorrect ISDN number entered on
OCMS (Kibblesworth). BT pinging incorrect ISDN number
(Charlestown).

Key documentation (OBC Branch OLA), even allowing for
other key business priorities, has been in the FS domain for
too long. POL have just been notified that a modified OLA
will be issued for review by 12/03/04.

FS to be more proactive in providing updates on issues.
FS to ensure that when problems have occurred lessons.
learnt feed into improvement activity.

FS to maintain momentum of document reviews and
progress review cycles and document approval in a
speedier fashion.

The OBC Team contact NIET-Central at 16:00 hrs daily with progress
on changes completed that day, together with details of any outlets
whereby the Fujitsu engineer is currently on site awaiting completion.
An email is sent each evening clarifying the outlets discussed during the
afternoon telephone call. Throughout the core day OBC Team notify
NIET-Central on any issues via telephone followed by email
communication for clarity. The OBC Change Manager is copied so that
any potential problem sites can be quickly notified to Post Office Ltd
Senior Management.

Fujitsu Services have tabled the BT Pre-survy proposal, which we hope
to implement from 3 May 2004. A joint meeting is planned between
both businesses on 15" April 2004 to realign lead times and E2E OBC
Processes.

There is evidence that NIET-Central may be struggling with the ‘mobile
solution’ and Fujitsu Services OBC Team are willing to visit Chesterfield
to give a presentation and/or offer Advice and Guidance. Alternatively
PO Limited are very welcome to visit Fujitsu Services in Crewe.

the call in question was regarding verification of an engineer. The HSH
did not have the list of engineers performing this exercise, this caused
the bounced call as the desk are not normally required to verify

H1.3 shows ACTUAL SLT achieved by the HSH. Due to high call volumes in excess of the 13k contractual monthly maximum in November and December, the SLT achievement for both
months and Q4 2003, has been recalculated by Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd in accordance with Schedule 15 paragraph 4.1.1. The following results are therefore the contractual
achievement against the target:

November 2003: 1.4%; December 2003 : 2.5%; Q4 2003 : 2.2%

Quarter 1 also saw high call volumes in excess of the 13k monthly contractual limit. The “Abandoned Call” and “Call to Answer within 30 seconds” SLT achievement has therefore been
recalculated by Fujitsu Services in accordance with Schedule 15 paragraph 4.1.1

Abandoned: January 2004 6.44%; February 4.89%; March 4.1%;
Quarter 1 2004 5.14%.

Call to answer within 30 seconds: January 2004 82.42%; February & March unchanged;
Quarter 1 2004 82.23%.

7.1.2 REVIEW OF TELEPHONY SLT ACHIEVEMENT

Sustained high call volumes in March resulted in the failure to meet the “Abandoned Call SLT” for March with an achievement of 5.6% against
a target of 5%. In total 15,153 calls were logged by the desk during March, 2,153 in excess of the monthly 13,000 contractual limit. The
“Abandonned Call SLT” has therefore been recalculated in accordance with Schedule 15 paragraph 4.1.1 giving an achievement for March of
4.12% and a quarterly achievement of 5.14%.

7.2.2 REVIEW OF ENGINEER SERVICES

The average time to repair figure has been driven up by sustained increases in the number of engineering visits this quarter. At around 4,800
visits in March this is about 20% higher than the expected volume. Work is in hand to try and drive down the number of hardware visits and
this should result in an improvement in the average downtime figure.
