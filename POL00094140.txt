HOW SHOULD YOU DEAL
WITH SIGNIFICANT
STATEMENTS?

POL00094140
POL00094140

07/07/2014

As noted above, an “interview” is defined as the
‘questioning of a person regarding his involvement or
suspected involvement in a criminal offence or offences
which, under paragraph 10.1, must be carried out under
caution.’

spontaneous statement made by a suspect cannot
amount to an interview.

However if questions are then put as a result of such a
statement, what follows will plainly be an interview.

One question alone may be an interview.

> Awritten record should be made of any comments
made by the suspect, including unsolicited
comments, which are outside the context of an
interview but which might be relevant to the
offence,

>Any record must be timed and signed by the
maker,

> When practicable the suspect shall be given the
opportunity to read that record and to sign it as
correct or to indicate how they consider it to be
inaccurate.

POL00094140

POL00094140

‘Twywrwrreerreererenresy eee eee

When a suspect agrees to read the record and sign
it as correct, they should be asked to endorse the
record with, e.g. ‘I agree that this is a correct
record of what was said’ and add their signature,

If the suspect does not agree with the record, the
details of any disagreement should be recorded and
the suspect should be asked to read the details and
sign them to the effect that they accurately reflect
their disagreement.

Any refusal to sign should also be recorded.

>-Any spontaneous remarks should be put to the
suspect at the commencement of the formal
interview,

The interviewer, after cautioning the suspect,
should read out any significant statement and ask
the suspect whether they confirm or deny that
earlier statement or silence and if they want to
add anything.

(a) The accused is arrested;

(b)A constable reasonably believes that the object, substance or mark,

Ps

PACE Code C

10.10 When a suspect interviewed at a police station or authorised place of detention after
arrest fails or refuses to answer certain questions, or to answer satisfactorily, after due
warning, see Note 10F, a court or jury may draw such inferences as appear proper under the

Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, sections 36 and 37. Such inferences may only be
drawn when:

(a) the restriction on drawing adverse inferences from silence, see Annex C, does not apply;

(b) the suspect is arrested by a constable and fails or refuses to account for any objects, marks
or substances, or marks on such objects found:

° on their person;
* in or on their clothing or footwear;
* — otherwise in their possession; or

* _ in the place they were arrested;

(c) the arrested suspect was found by a constable at a place at or about the time the offence for
which that officer has arrested them is alleged to have been committed, and the suspect fails
or refuses to account for their presence there.

When the restriction on drawing adverse inferences from silence applies, the suspect may still

be asked to account for any of the matters in (8) or (c) but the special warning described in
paragraph 10.11 will not apply and must not be given.

10.11 For an inference to be drawn when a Suspect fails or refuses to answer a question about

one of these matters or to answer it satisfactorily, the suspect must first be told in ordinary
language:

(a) what offence is being investigated;

(b) what fact they are being asked to account for;

(c) this fact may be due to them taking part in the commission of the offence;

(d) a court may draw a proper inference if they fail or refuse to account for this fact; and

(e) a record is being made of the interview and it may be given in evidence if they are brought
to trial.

STACKED CASES

UPDATE

The purpose of the Review was to consider whether the defence, in any
individual case, might seek a stay of the proceedings as an Abuse of the
Process of the Court by reason of delay and, if such an application is
made, the prospects for success.

Abuse of Process — General Principles

1. The court will stay (i.e. bring to an end) any proceedings where it
considers that the continued prosecution of a defendant is so unfair such
that it amounts to an abuse of the court's process.

2. In the context of POL cases, the unfairness likely to be complained of
would be what the defence would assert was an excessive delay in
bringing the matter to trial.

3. Thus for our purposes the term Abuse of Process is something of a
misnomer, for the real issue is not whether the prosecution has misused
the court's process, but whether the defendant may have a fair trial
notwithstanding the delay complained of.

4. The jurisdiction to stay proceedings as an Abuse of Process may arise in
two categories of case:

i. where it will be impossible for the defendant to have a fair
trial, and

ii. where a stay is necessary in order to protect the integrity of

the criminal justice system.

5. In general, we are concerned with the first of those two categories,

POL00094140

POL00094140

—_
COCOCHOHCOCOCOCOHOHSOOSCSCSOHCOHHOHOCOCOCOEOCECECO8A*

POL00094140

POL00094140

although to a limited extent there may be some overlap with the second.

6. Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights requires that a
defendant be tried “...within a reasonable time...”

7. It does not follow that a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable

time will always result in a stay being granted. Delay will only justify a stay
if either a fair trial is no longer possible, or if it would be unfair to try the
defendant for some other compelling reason.

8. The higher courts have held that cases where it might be unfair to try a
defendant would include cases where the delay was of such an order as to
make it unfair that the proceedings should continue. Those cases however

will be very exceptional.

9. A stay will never be granted where the defendant is unable to point to
some tangible and real prejudice caused by the delay.

10. Even a very long delay will not necessarily justify a stay: in one well-known
case the Court of Appeal and (on further appeal) the European Court of
Human Rights held that a delay of 56 years had not rendered a fair trial
impossible.

11.1t is also relevant to note that the Court of Appeal has taken the firm view
that delay in bringing complex fraud allegations to trial should not, save in
very exceptional circumstances, result in a stay of proceedings,
particularly where the only or main evidence comprises of contemporary
documents.

12.Delay due merely to the complexity of a case should never be the
foundation of a stay and a distinction is to be drawn between cases which
turn largely on documentation and those which do not. This aspect of the
jurisprudence is of particular interest in the context of POL prosecutions,

POL00094140

oa

COSOSCHCHOSCHOHSHOHSHSHCHOHCHOHHOHOHSHCHHHHOHEHHEEEE

POL00094140

POL00094140

as

13.Where a defendant seeks a stay because of some delay, the court is

required to consider a number of principles:

iti.

even where delay is unjustifiable, or is the fault of the
prosecutor, a permanent stay should be the exception rather
than the rule.

. where there is no fault on the part of the prosecution, it will

be very rare for a stay to be granted.

no stay should be granted in the absence of some serious
prejudice to the defence so that a fair trial is impossible.
Serious prejudice may involve the unavailability of defence
evidence and/or witnesses and in this context the loss must

be real as opposed to speculative or fanciful.

. the purpose of the trial process is, inter alia, to ensure that all

relevant factual issues are before the jury, including any
reasons for the delay and that, where that approach is
adopted the process will usually result in a fair trial.

If, having considered all of the above factors the judge finds
that a fair trial will be possible, a stay should not be granted.

Other Issues Which Can Lead to an Abuse of Process Argument.

14.Non Availability of evidence e.g. loss of CCTV or other documents that
would have assisted the defence.

15.Overriding of client privilege e.g. listening into the conference between a
solicitor and his client.

Breach of promise where the Crown goes back on a decision not to
prosecute. Rv Croydon Justices exp Dean Lord Justice Staughton
stated that, “the prosecution of a person who has received a promise,
undertaking or representation from police that he will not be prosecuted
is capable of being an abuse of process.’ — does not apply when there is
fresh material

Disclosure - Fair disclosure of information to an accused, by the
prosecution, is ‘an inseparable part of a fair trial’, under article 6 ECHR.A
failure on the part of the prosecution to make proper disclosure may
result, in appropriate circumstances, in proceedings being stayed as an
abuse of process.

Entrapment - There is a judicial discretion to stay proceedings where an
offence has been incited by another.

Unfair Conduct, abuse of executive power - The leading case in this area
is Rv Horseferry Road Magistrates’ Court, ex p Bennett Lord Lowry
observed: “I consider that a court has a discretion to stay any criminal
proceedings on the grounds that to try those proceedings will amount to
an abuse of its own process either (1) because it will be impossible
(usually by reason of delay) to give the accused a fair trial or (2) because
it offends the court's sense of justice and propriety to be asked to try the

accused in the circumstances of a particular case.”

Adverse publicity - Media-generated notoriety can prejudice an accused
and this may lead to a jury being discharged, an indictment being stayed
or a conviction being quashed because of adverse publicity. Such
adverse media coverage may also give rise to a breach of the tight to a
fair trial under article 6(1) of the ECHR and lead to contempt of court
proceedings against the offending publisher.

Practical Considerations.

e Do not discuss with a suspect the reasons for a perceived
delay in an investigation.

« Do not agree that a delay is unjustified.

e Do not hold out promises that a prosecution might not
proceed

e Preserve all evidence both used and unused

e Do not encourage a suspect to commit an offence or
encourage another to do so.

* Find a suitable place to talk to the witness.

* Put them at ease and fully discuss the incident
before embarking on the statement.

* Officers should be satisfied the witness has
told them all they know, before a statement is

called to give evidence in criminal proceedings

* Do not allow the witness to exaggerate.

* If it is suspected a witness is exaggerating,
