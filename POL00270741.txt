Indeed. Grabiner is meeting Neuberger on Sunday to discuss this exact point.

It feels highly irregular to warn the CA of an appeal of an application which was dismissed, with permission
to appeal refused. What was he contacting the CA about given there was no appeal that could be made?

All
Please see attached - an initial order from the Court of Appeal.

Points 1, 3 and 4 are routine. Note - that Freeths have until 25 April 2019 to comment on the application for
permission which suggests nothing else is going to happen for 2 weeks.

Point 2 may require us to re-assess our plans around the timing of the main appeal.

One curious point is that this Order was made by Coulson LJ, former head of the TCC and Fraser is of course
the current head of the TCC. Given Fraser's comments at the handing down of the recusal judgment that he
had warned the C of A that an appeal would be coming, it makes us question whether he lined up / had
spoken to Coulson in advance.

I've asked LGQC to think about this.
