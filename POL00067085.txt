I refer to your email and would like to clarify that we require up-to-date schedules and NOT copies of
all the NAE’s.... The schedules should be for both statements and exhibits as the ones we hold on
file do not reflect the NAE's.

Please call me should you require further clarification on this point.

Many thanks
