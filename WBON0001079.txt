Suspense Accounts

Dear Al,

We are meeting tomorrow at 17:00pm. The purpose of this meeting is to share with you the initial findings
from the work being performed by Deloitte on suspense accounts. As you are aware, this work is being
performed in order for Post Office to be able to prepare its defence in the Group Litigation.

I have attached a short high level ‘Briefing Paper’ that Mark Westbrook (Deloitte) and I will be able to
provide further detail on tomorrow. If you have any questions beforehand, please do let me know.

Jonathan Gribben from Bond Dickinson has also asked that I dial him in to the meeting. Please do let me
know if you have any objections to that.
