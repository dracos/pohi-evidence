Theresa/Sarah

Can you look at the email from Janet, James Arbuthnot’s PA in which she suggests some date for a call
with James before the MP meeting and interim report on the 8" July.

Would you let me know a time I can offer back to Janet

Mark please see the last line as we need to be more proactive about handling this as the 8" gets nearer.

Can you let me know if you want me to say anything back to Janet

Good morning Alwen,

Further to this, James has asked me to go ahead and set this up. I think a phone call is going
to be easier for them both. James is about to ask Ian and Ron for a meeting on 2 July as a
heads-up n the interim report to be delivered on 8 July. I don’t know if and when Paul is
expecting news from them about their findings, but it makes sense for James and Paul to talk
AFTER James has been given some warning about what the interim report will contain.

Do any of the following suit Paula?
« Wednesday 3 July - anytime between 9 - 10.30am, or after 5pm on
e Thursday 4 July — after 3.30pm
e Friday is possible, but if we could try for earlier, it would be better from this end

Furthermore, James is starting to talk to the media. He has scheduled phone calls with Private
Eye and Computer Weekly which will simply be to let them know about the interim report and
its presentation on 8 July. Media will not be invited to the meeting.

Let me know what you think.

Kind regards
Janet

Paula does not mind face to face or a call, although a call may be easier to organise for both of them

Have a great weekend

Thanks

Thanks Alwen,

There won’t be a problem regarding getting Paula and James together. 1’ll start looking in the diary for a
slot. Would Paula prefer meeting or phone call?

Kind regards

Thanks Janet this is very helpful.

{ will get Paula’s view on attending the meeting on our attending the meeting on the 8". Did you
manage to get James’ view on a Paula/James meeting or call before the 8" as we discussed.

Thanks

Dear Alwen,

1. Alan Bates
Interim report - James had an extremely good telephone conversation with Alan Bates today.
He has asked me to let you know that Alan was content with the proposed content of the
interim report. Alan was more concerned with what happens after this has been delivered
(which is due at a meeting to take place at Westminster on 8 July, with Ian and Ron
presenting). James touched on the point Paula has made about potentially bringing the
investigation of further cases in-house within the Post Office. Alan said he was not entirely
comfortable with this, but James persuaded him to put this matter into abeyance for the time

POL-0098175

being, and Alan agreed. We can return to this after the interim report when we have all seen
what it has to say.

Media — James also discussed media with him. We are beginning to be approached and are
putting people on hold — Private Eye, Computer Weekly, BBC Shropshire local radio. Alan said
he was not responsible for the article in this week’s Private Eye, and James believes him. Alan
said he was happy not to go public on anything while the investigation process was underway.

2. Meeting 8 July
Tan and Ron have agreed to present an interim report based on 3 cases to MPs, here at
Westminster on 8 July. James has said to both them and Alan that at the moment, he is not
minded to invite representatives of the Post Office to attend, given that you will presumably
only have just seen the report yourselves. Do you have a view on this? James needs to think
through this a little more, so it would be helpful if he knew your thoughts.

Tam going to email Ron and Ian with all this as well, but wanted to let you know the view from
this end is good. Might you let Paula know please?

Kind regards
Janet
