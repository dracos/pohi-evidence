Dear Alan
Cash Account Loss £1041.86
Ihave received correspondence from the Management Information Support Duty
in Birmingham advising me that they now require repayment for the loss of
£1041.86 currently held in Table 2a of your Cash Account.
Unfortunately neither the visits from Selwyn Berry and Ki Barnes nor the pension
& allowance checks carried out for the problematic weeks, revealed specific

reasons as to how the resultant loss of £1041,86 initially occurred.

I would therefore appreciate if, as a matter of some urgency, you could advise me
of your proposals to now make good the loss.
