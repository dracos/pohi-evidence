Dear Mr Arbuthnot

RE: My Client: Angela Sefton

We are a Criminal Defence firm of Solicitors and we have been instructed to act on
behalf of Angela Sefton who faces a charge of false accounting; a matter which is
currently listed before the Liverpool Crown Court.

Our client was employed by a sub-postmaster at a small post office in the Fazakerley
area of Liverpool as an assistant and it was during her employment that deficiencies
arose in relation to payments in of money deposited by clients of the Post office.

Both she and her Co-accused, Miss Anne Neild, tried their best to make good the
deficiencies out of their own pocket for a considerable period of time but in the end
they were overwhelmed and they then informed the Post office audit unit who later
spoke to both ladies in the course of a formal interview.

Unfortunately both of them had been charged with false accounting. They were both
Operating the Horizon computer system during their employment with the post office.

Our client consulted her MP, Mr Steve Rotherham (Liverpool/Walton) and he very
kindly asked his assistant Gary Booth to make some enquiries. Mr Booth spoke to
the Royal Mail and they confirmed that you are working with a small number of other
MP's in relation to complaints received by over 100 sub-postmasters concerning the
Operation of this computer system.

We would be very grateful that if you would confirm that indeed you are representing
@ number of individuals in relation to this enquiry. If you could let us know what
Progress has been made and what, if any, steps can be taken to look into the
workings of the computer system. We are sure that it would be of great benefit to our
client's case.

defence and integrity
