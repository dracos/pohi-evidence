I
AMS EI OF THE NEGOTI IG COMMITTEE

MR BURROWS advised that unfortunately he had had to cancel a scheduled meeting in
December of the Negotiating Committee, but the Committee had met the previous evening. I

1, POST OFFICE BOARD (PO BD)
Project Genesis

Project Genesis was described as a new development emanating from the Post Office
Group. This latest initiative came hot on the tail of other Post Office initiatives and the
General Secretary, who had a attended a special presentation, was invited to provide an
over-view of how it dovetailed into what else was happening on the automation front for the
Post Office Group.

THE GENERAL SECRETARY reported that he had seen the need to sweep up all the
different automation projects in the Group; the BA/POCL automation plans had been
renamed Horizon, but there were 2 other initiatives to be linked: namely the Transaction
Information System (TIPS), and the Stock Control! System (SACS), the latter being an
integrated system designed to replenish Post Office stock. Project Genesis was, therefore,
the pivot, with each of the Businesses within The Post Office Group having its own
automation project. In what he described as an illustration of how The Post Office could
look, he described an integrated system with a central stores at Swindon instead of stores for
each Region. Project Genesis was an opportunity for The Post Office to be at the leading
edge of technology and quoted Duncan Hine as referring to the “potential to be come the
most powerful virtual company in Europe". He appreciated that there was a perspective in
which the future could look scary as customers need never enter a Post Office to access
Post Office services - being able to access them on the intemet and, at the delivery end, the
postman presenting them with a pad to sign. There was, too, Government Direct to be taken
into account where what could happen was similar: the public able to tax their cars at a kiosk
in the local library via a system capable of checking insurance and MOT details. It should
- also be appreciated, however, if The Post Office did not embrace such technological
concepts for the future then someone else would. Developments needed to be watched
carefully - with Post Office involvement the Federation could influence/steer the direction but
if another company/organisation gained the initiative in the market Sub-Postmasters would
be disadvantaged. He commented: as Mr Hine had remarked “Better Genesis than Exodus”.

oS

THE CHAIRMAN endorsed the remarks as the need for the Federation was even
greater. MR BRENNAN agreed that, indeed, if the Federation adopted the wrong
attitude it could not hope to change events once any system was up and running.
In response to MR BRADBROOK’s suggestion that a Sub Committee should be set
up to look after Sub-Postmasters’ interests, MR BURROWS pointed out the General
Secretary had seen the presentation, the Federation had conducted a successful
ACT campaign, the full implications of Project Genesis, were not yet known,
Mr Sweetman would be addressing the Council the following day, and the
Negotiating Committee would be involved. The Editor, MR BROADWITH, advised
he had not printed a letter to the journal on the subject pending a presentation.
MR BURROWS agreed with MR EDMONDSON that the whole Executive Council
should have a presentation as quickly as possible, not just the Negotiating
Committee.

=~

Executive Officers expressed their anxieties: MR JANNETTA was uneasy about the
impact upon Sub-Postmasters of Horizon saying POCL had spoken of massive
savings to the Business but not mentioned any benefit to Sub-Postmasters.
THE GENERAL SECRETARY gave some examples of possible benefits: no need to
carry out a cash account balance or stock reconciliation, modem technology used to
give advice on such things as traffic flows, etc. MR BRADBROOK was worried
about City reports and on software which could deliver letters electronically via

2 EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - JANUARY 1997
Royal Mail. MR DARVILL was concemed that Sub-Postmasters’ wishes could be
overridden in stock control matters, and MR INGHAM cautioned that Benefits
Agency work needed careful attention as the future could see an overtuming of
what had been achieved in the past.

MR CHALLINOR said the EPOS (Electronic Point of Sale) system had so impressed
him that he had installed the system in his own business. He estimated it to have
saved him £5,000 in excessive stock holdings. Project Genesis might take work
away but there would also be windows of opportunity so the Federation/Sub-
Postmasters must be part of it and he, himself, would link his own business to such
a system. Sky TV had already introduced a screen-ordering system but there were
many people who could not afford the equipment, and other who would not wish to
use it.

THE GENERAL SECRETARY said there was nothing to indicate Sub-Postmasters’
individual requirements for stock would not be recognised. If the Federation/Sub-
Postmasters said “Stop the word, I want to get off’, they would be allowed tol
Commercial companies were constrained to make the best use of technology,
ICL/Pathway would try to ensure their own place and use of their equipment in Post
Offices. There would still be a place for the touchy-feely Post Office and Executive
Officers should question Mr Sweetman the following day.

2. GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS (PO PZ)
Government Direct

The Green Paper Government Direct was described as having implications for Post Office
Counters and, indeed, the Post Office Group - whilst they are looking at Project Genesis as a
means of delivering the benefits, it was an area where the Federation needed to proceed with
great caution. A draft submission from the Federation would be circulated to the Executive
Council following the meeting.

‘ost Office Inquiry - Trade Indus! mmittee

The Federation was now awaiting the recommendations of the Post Office Inquiry of the
Trade and Industry Committee which, it was hoped, would capture and address the Points
made in the Federation's Memorandum to them.

3. POST OFFICE COUNTERS
Post Office Counters Board (PO PC 02)

Details of the changes to Post Office Counters Ltd’s Board had been circulated to the
Executive Council following their issue on the 29th November. As far as the Counters
Business was concerned, those Board changes involved Bob Peaple and David Taylor
moving to Royal Mail. David Taylor would be replaced by David Morphey of Royal Mail and
Bob Peapte's role would be split between Jonathan Evans and Dick Wheelhouse. Paul Rich
would take on Bob Peaple’s Information Strategy role. There would, undoubtedly, be other
Board changes. It was, however, disappointing that, having built up a relationship with
people over many years, to have to start again with new people. An example of the
difficulties that such changes created, was the last meeting between the Negotiating
Committee and the Counters Executive Committee on strategy, when the Committee had
had to deal with the Directors who had been advised at that time that they would be leaving
the Counters Business within a month. That meeting was clearly not as valuable as others
had been.

6. Training for Sub-Postmasters (PC HR 04)

It was regrettable that there was nothing further to report on the subject of Sub-Postmasters’

training. The subject had, however, been raised in the context of the Pay Review and in the

context of Quality. Transactional training, in particular, seemed to be worrying the Counters

Business, whilst the Federation was pushing af their door to improve the whole range of

training which should be being provided to Sub-Postmasters. There was no doubt that this

was one of the subjects which had fallen victim to the prolonged discussions on the pay f
negotiations, and it seemed appropriate to adopt this as one of the Federation's Key
Objectives for 1997.

8. (a) ocal Area Network Plans (PC NW 02}
Franchise Offices (formerly PC FO)
Conformance Trial - Raising the Standard

There was nothing specific to report. However, it would have been noted that, as part of the
ancillary issues associated with the Pay Claim and Pay Review, there was now a formal offer
for the Federation to become involved in the networking for Sub Post Offices, and the
Federation would be seeking full Involvement in the formulation of local area network plans
once that forum became established and was underway. THE CHAIRMAN directed
discussion of Opening Hours should be taken under /tem 12(C) Trading Hours. i

(b) Future ost ices

MR ABERNETHY referred to the circulation of the article from the Donegal
Democrat of 7th November 1996 and foresaw damage which could be done to Post I
Offices. An exercise undertaken by an RNM indicated that only 13, out of 56 I
Offices, would be included in automation. He pointed out that if APT machines had
been made available to each Office, that would have allowed rural Offices to get
involved with a basic sort of automation. He wondered how many Sub Offices
would eventually drop out as this would impact upon finance - as had been
experienced at the time of decimalisation.

THE GENERAL SECRETARY saw 2 issues: (i) the possibility of shrinking network
following automation. Although the Federation did support POCL in closing a
Community Office, if it was necessary, at the time of a Sub-Postmaster’s
resignation, he agreed if a Sub-Postmaster was thinking of leaving, automation
could be the final straw. The first approach was to produce a video explaining
Horizon in a warm way to encourage Sub-Postmasters to embrace technology as
non-threatening. The Federation had offered assistance in this for members and
non-members, eg, Branch officials should Sub-Postmasters’ about their worries and
how the Federation could help. He did not believe the Counters Business was
scope-ing rural Offices with a view to closing them. The Newspaper was an
examination on (ii) harmonising The Post. The UK was unique in the number of
Post Offices it had - although Post Office was a misnomer, Post Offices were post-
orientated - ard there were concems about the future of the work and the future of
the Federation. Hence the need to support the introduction of automation in a warm
way to make sure Sub-Postmasters stayed on board.

(c) Counter Automation - BA/POCL (PC NW 06 01)

Although there was no circulated correspondence on this subject, it was now known that the
BA/POCL project was named “Horizon” and that, on the current plans, the second phase of
the roll-out would commence in Spring 1997 and would involve a further 90 Post Offices in
the South West, and 100 in Tyne & Wear. There was much work to be done on this and the
work conceming the payment due to Sub-Postmasters for the transactions involved could
again be seen as part of the ancillary letter to that accompanying the Pay Review.
Additionally, a communication was awaited from Post Office Counters advising Sub-
Postmasters of what they can expect from Day-One when the new system was put into their
Post Offices. There had been confusion generated by the different information given out by
different people within the Counters Business and there was a need for a clear, concise,
piece of communications - and the Federation were pressing for that and, indeed, had been
promised that it would be forthcoming. Continued pressure would be applied to the Counters
Business to avoid some of the confusion which was clearly being experienced at the
moment.

Executive Officers expressed their concems about the confusion getting worse,

rather than better with some Regions failing to disseminate information quickly <
enough, or inaccurately - for instance some RNM’s were advising that only one

counter position in some Post Offices would be automated. It appeared that the

introduction of the system would not be piece-meal, as previously thought, but from

day-one, although it also seemed that a manual input would be needed for those

not fully automated. Clarification was required on what would happen with the

ECCO system once Horizon was adopted.

« MR BURROWS shared the Council's frustration. The information
gained in Newcastle did seem at odds with that imparted at the
meeting with the CEC; the RDC did not seem to know what was going
on and many POCL personnel had been on holiday over the
Christmas/New Year period. Action to gain information was a priority
as it was important for the future of the organisation and the trust of
members.

MR BRADBROOK's observed that when the ALPS business had started it had been
advised that the General Secretary would be consulted on all parts of the project -
but now POCL seemed to moving away from that. THE GENERAL SECRETARY
agreed that was when the specifications were being written but the Federation had
not been part of the informed selection following tendering. Matters had been made
more difficult because of personnel changes: Bob Peaple had ceased running this
for POCL and Paul Rich had been brought in, Andrew Stott had since left and
another person brought in.

(d) Counter Automation - APT/BAR-Coding (PC NW 06 02

There was no correspondence on this subject, although Post Office Counters would soon be
seeking a meeting early in the New Year to discuss the implications of bar-coding of bills. It
was expected that the Counters Business would approach the Federation for a reduction in
the payment for the acceptance of utility bills, and such overtures would be resisted.

MR BRADBROOK advised of some disorder in his Region with Sub-Postmasters
tearing off the bottom part of the Bill so one could not recognise if bills had already
been paid. MR BURROWS agreed that the gas billing system was in some
disarray; there were, though, clear and concise instructions to those operating APT

barcoding not to retain anything but to give the whole bill and receipt back to the
customer. He suggested, however, that an attempt should be made to check back
to see if anything could be done about it.

As a point of information, MR DARVILL advised Midlands Electricity transactions
were barcoded but Post Office APT machines could not read them.
MR CHALLINOR advised he understood the plastic card was designed to be used
by other outiets.

MR BUTLIN commented on the problem caused by misleading information in
Counter News Week 29, and a suitable amendment had still not been issued in the
Counter News (the correct information being that Offices without barcode readers
should enter bills for Eastem Elecctric, East Midlands Electric and British Gas on the
Daily Record of Deposits, G6301, as Pivot Code 18).

(e) Counter Automation - ALPS (PC NW 06 07)

Reimbursement of electricity costs for ALPS

In view of the activity on the Pay Review and the bringing together of the Annual Report, the
Negotiating Committee had been unable to proceed with the Resolution of the Executive
Council made at the October Meeting to pursue a goodwill payment for those Sub-
Postmasters currently operating the ALPS system in the London Region. This,had not been
overlooked, and would be pursued at the most opportune time. The Committee would,
however, be negotiating with the same people who negotiated the Pay Review with, and one
of the ancillary issues was, of course, the payment for counter automation. There was a
commitment to be in meaningful discussions with Post Office Counters in a matter of 2 to 3
weeks, and the Committee would be making representations for this goodwill payment at that
time. It would also be capturing the point about the heat generated by computers which has 4
necessitated the installation of air-conditioning.

MR DARVILL advised that the time taken to access information within the ALP’s
system was becoming even slower.

() Counter Automation - Mondex Trial (PC NW 06 08)

Mondex had received a boost to its credibility at the end of November when Mastercard {
acquired a 50% share in the Company. Visa had announced a trial of its own electronic I
purse, VisaCash, in Leeds - and American Express had secured a similar deal to Mastercard

in signing up with the majority of Belgium's retail banks, who also produce a smartcard I
electronic purse system. Clearly the banks and financial institutions were pushing their I
customers into a cash-less society but the information from customers themselves was that
they are still reluctant to take on the Mondex principle of an electronic purse. With 3 major
Players in this field, there would clearly be pressure on consumers to become cash-less and
probably more advertising in that direction in the near future. In the meantime, however,
there was considerable uncertainty - not only with consumers but also with the financial
institutions themselves - who had still to turn a successful pilot into a commercial winner. It
was likely that the principle of an electronic purse would form part of the wider automation
discussions on Project Genesis, the Govemment’s Green Paper and, of course, Post Office
Counters’ own initiatives.

(9) Funding of SPSOs (PC NW 09 03)

The General Secretary and MR BURROWS had visited Cashco in Manchester when an
impressive explanation had been given of the processes involved In the cash assembly and
delivery to Sub-Postmasters. {t is still the Federation's intention to achieve a national
standard for the provision of cash to Sub Post Offices and an early meeting with Bryan

r

Roberts, the Head of Distribution for Post Office Counters, was sought to resolve existing
«problems,

MR JANNETTA was of the view that in order to meet a national standard for the
delivery of cash during run-up to holiday period, Cashco would have to double its
fleet of vehicles and wondered whether the EC should recommend a figure, eg, 50K
or 125K. THE GENERAL SECRETARY said the amount was a concem for POCL,
not Cashco, and what the Federation was looking for was a process map which
gave Sub-Postmasters a delivery when they required it.

MR EDMONDSON advised the in Leeds private carriers had previously been used
but, following the recent switch to Cashco, the service so far had been excellent.

9. SECURITY

{a) Cl ‘SP Me: s (PC NW 11 04
and other subjects under Item 9 Security

A meeting between the General Secretary, MR BURROWS, and the Security Division had iq
taken place on the 28th October and clearance of the Minutes was awaited when they would

circulated to the Executive Council. The subjects covered under this section of the Agenda

had all discussed at the meeting. Executive Council Officers had been provided with details

of the Matrix approach to Format and Security. This Matrix was circulated on the 19th

December, and the details should be a useful addition for Executive Officers in dealing with

questions from individual Sub-Postmasters in their Region.

Also circulated on the 19th December, were the results of the 1996 Security Questionnaire.
These results set out the views of Sub-Postmasters and staff regarding security and this
indicated that there were differing views held by differing groups of Sub-Postmasters. This
pointed-up the difficulty of trying to provide security equipment and protection for Sub- ”
Postmasters across a wide network with differing requirements. The information contained in
the results would be used in on-going discussions with the Security Division.

As far as the equipment was concemed, information regarding the research on Screen 2000
has been provided to Council - from which it would be seen that, generally speaking, the
Screen 2000 had been received very well by those Sub-Postmasters concemed.

The subject of the Trauma Care programme had been discussed at the meeting with the
Security Division on the 28th October and a letter received from Margaret Beaumont dated ¢€
25th November. The letter gave an up-to-date resumé on where the Trauma Care

programme stood and the leaflet, referred to in the letter, was awaited to cover information

on the effects of trauma and the availability of the trauma counselling. These would be

circulated to the Executive Council on receipt.

The General Secretary and MR BURROWS had meet with Cashco on 29th October, as
previously reported earlier. Part of the presentation from Cashco was to ask the Federation
to reconsider the method by which Smoke and Dye cases were recelved at Sub Post Offices.
There had been resistance to Cashco's overtures for Sub-Postmasters to receive these
boxes; however, the offer was made to afford Cashco an opportunity to demonstrate their
commitment to Sub-Postmasters’ security by making a contribution towards the Security
Screen Update programme currently being undertaken. Cashco had agreed to discuss the
matter with Alex Docherty of Post Office Counters and development from this discussion
were awaited.

Being cynical, MR EVANS saw a balanced scale between commercial advantage
and risk. He quoted an instance of a Sub Post Office of 13,000-14,000 units having
had 5 armed robberies but was still awaiting security camera/s, with lack of funds
being the excuse given.

8 EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - JANUARY 1997

NFSP00000468
NFSP00000468

MR DARVILL was concerned about the inadequacy of some RNM’s who had
received some trauma care training. MR BURROWS said the Federation had been
endeavouring to get trauma care for some time and had now secured it. He advised
that RNM's had been trained in order to provide an initial, point of call, contact and
advice, with more professional advice provided by the Employee Support
counsellor. If the latter advice was not forthcoming if needed, that was a matter
which needed to be addressed, but it could be difficult to access as often people
denied needing help.

MR JONES advocated ensuring that trauma care counsellors were available during
holiday periods - this matter to be pursued at Regional Security Forums.
MR BURROWS referred to Margaret Beaumont’s letter of 25 November “Should
one of our sub offices experience an attack but the retail network manager has not
yet received training, nor is a trained substitute available, then Employee Support
will be alerted immediately so that those affected have exactly the same support
offer to them. No one should be left to suffer without support being readily
available.” He appreciated the frustrations expressed but now wanted to see how
well the new procedures worked out.

MR BRADBROOK advised how Sub-Postmasters and assistants who had suffered
an armed attack often saw every customer as a potential assailant. Trauma care
was non-existent in the South East. On Regional Security Forums, he had had
5 Regional Offices. On Screen 2000 whatever company was used conformance to
POCL's specifications was required. It appeared POCL were willing to visit Post I
Office to assess equipment and give them a clean bill of health. MR BURROWS

advocated that when Executive Officers attended Regional Security Forums they

should be pro-active in obtaining as much information as possible, ie, on equipment

utilisation and budgets. He objected to a Region having a security budget of, say,

£495,000 but having to write of £1% million in losses.

In reply to a query from MR BROADWITH about Sub-Postmasters who though I
Screen 2000 unsuitable for their Office, MR BURROWS not received any such I
report previously so it caused a dilemma - the Federation having endorsed Screen
2000 because of the split.

MR INGHAM advised on RNM’s in the North East putting security requirements in
Letters of Appointment. He thought security matters POCL’s responsibility and
thought Mr Bradbrook’s Bill of Health idea good. THE GENERAL SECRETARY
expressed surprise on the former point because the relevant Agreement had been
circulated. (BSC 5/1996 of 25 January 1996).

Referring to what incoming Sub-Postmasters were required to do, in MR BUTLIN’s
view POCL were always trying to push the boundaries. He asked whether the
Regional Security Budgets were set in tablets of stone each year.
MR BURROWS replied each Region, each year, bid for a Security Budget
depending upon geographical area and should discuss with the Federation how
many alarms to bid for in the ensuing year. The difficulty was that the Head of
Human Resources was responsible for Security, whilst the Head of Facilities was
responsible for the Budget, so a dog-fight ensued, an example of which was to find
£50,000 creamed off the Security Budget for other purposes - hence the need to get
into Security Forums in depth. He urged Executive Officers to overcome any
difficulties and hold Security Forums in their Regions as quickly as possible but to

EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - JANUARY 1997 9

ensure that both parties leamed to develop mutual trust so that more information
could be shared and made available.

In reply to a question on who should be members of the Security Forum, THE
GENERAL SECRETARY did not presume to advice but was of the opinion the
persons from the Federation should be of the highest level possible but dependable
and capable of keeping information in confidence. The Federation had asked for
details of Security Budgets, not only the global sum of money but a breakdown of
the £800,000.

« It was quoted by MR EDMONDSON that the quoted price of Screen
2000 fad risen from £2,900 in June, to £3,927 in October.
MR MARSHALL believed the increase might be for “holes” - ie, to
facilitate the installation of Horizon equipment at a Sater date.
MR BURROWS undertook to take the matter back.

Change in Focus of the Quality Function
Putting the Customer First - Transactional Training

The main news on Putting the Customer First was the changing the frequency of the
questionnaire - which had been the subject of a letter dated the 18th December from Post
Office Counters. A key decision emanating from the research done on Customer First, was
to move the frequency of issuing questionnaires for those Offices achieving 90%-scores from
every year to every 2 years. There would be other changes, and the offer to keep the
Federation informed had been received. However, the latest initiative in Putting the
Customer First would be welcomed by Sub-Postmasters who were feeling there to be
questionnaire overload within the network and vindicated the stance taken by the Executive
Council.

As regards the Transactional Training, the Counters Business had advised that 57% of Sub-
Postmasters were accepting the invitations and 26% of Sub-Postmasters had tumed down 2-
or-more invitations to attend this training. The Business was very concemed at the lower
acceptance rate of this style of training and would be asking the Federation's assistance in
identifying what more could be done to encourage Sub-Postmasters and their staff to attend
these training evenings. The Federation might need to address this particular subject of
training, as it had been criticising the Counters Business for not paying Sub-Postmasters and
their staff to go to training sessions. Clearly, even when payment was made, the take-up of
these sessions was still extremely low, The Committee would keep the Council advised as to
developments in this area.

( PayPoint (CashStop) (PC $C 2101)

The debut of PayPoint cards in Norther Ireland was not the Success its initiators had hoped
for - although the Federation could not, of course, take matters lightly. As could be seen
from the correspondence, a letter had been written to OFTEL to see if acceptance of these
PayPoint could not be undertaken on a much wider network, including Sub Post Offices. It
was understood that PayPoint was still on schedule to roll-out in April - a national roll-out and
would involve an eventual 8,000 terminals in neighbourhood shops and petrol forecourts
across the United kingdom.

A Head of Retail Network from the Midlands, Edward Inches, had defected to PayPoint to
join a colleague who defected from the Retail Development Centre in the early days.
Therefore, even though the launch in Norther Ireland was not the success that they would
have wanted, the Federation must not treat PayPoint as anything other than a serious threat
at this stage and do all it could to counter that threat.

To MR BUTLIN's request for information on what had happened to the APT
machines designated for Northern Ireland to THE GENERAL SECRETARY was
unable to give an immediate answer and replied that it was not yet known where
PayPoint was going next - there was talk of the Midlands, South West, but POCL
wanted to ensure the machines were in the right place at the right time.

MR ABERNETHY advised of a meeting between PayPoint and POCL before
Christmas when it had been suggested to the consortium that the cards should be
embossed in order to be made available through imprinters. He thought another
meeting imminent. He had heard that the reason why the trial had been switched to
Northem Ireland was that there were not enough outlet in the North East prepared
to undertake the work possibly because they would have to have their accounts
swept within 2 days to clear transactions. :

(g) NIPOC (PC SC 28)

The correspondence dated the 13th November, included a letter dated the 11th November
on the latest position on the NIPOC exercise. That correspondence, some of the strongest
which MR BURROWS had seen from Federation Headquarters, re-stated the Federation's
position:- that it still required confirmation that Sub-Postmasters excluded from the NIPOC.
exercise for staff costs would be excluded for the purpose of non-staff costs, and Mr Bloor
was working with John Legg of Post Office Counters in seeking to resolve the issues. It was
a very complicated and complex subject, the experts are working away on it and it was
hoped to have the position resolved in time for inclusion in the Supplementary Report.

MR EVANS recalled the subject discussed at last year's Conference. He had no
criticism of the Secretariat and Philip Bloor had explained the subject clearly to him.
He thought it unbelievable for POCL to change the criteria and wished to register his
deep concem that this money had been outstanding for 4 or § years. It should be
tepaid to Sub-Postmasters and reinvested into their private pensions. All the time
the Post Office held on to it, the money was lost to Sub-Postmasters,

There is no correspondence on the subject, although advice had been received from
Girobank that they had purchased Sovereign Finance. Some Executive Officers would recall
that Sovereign Finance were a very ‘iffy’ company and there were a number of complaints
about them from Sub-Postmasters. They had since been bought out by The Bank of Austria,
Austria's largest financial institution and had significantly cleaned-up its act. Its acquisition
by Girobank would clean it up yet more and, it was hoped, the company could trade on
Girobank’s good name, and it added to Girobank's portfolio in now providing specialist
financial services for business. The Managing Director of Girobank had asked that this be
made known to the Federation's Executive Council and Sub-Postmasters and, with the
Editor's kind permission, it might be helpful for relationship if a space could be found, at the
Editor's discretion, to announce this acquisition in the “Subpostmaster".

MR DARVILL mentioned that the National Westminster Bank were closing 350
