Detail

TC Gavin Matthews. He has spoken to BAQC: Mediation cases can go on sep
spreadsheet. So far as date is concerned - understand why 1/1/10 but on the basis
no bugs prior to then on old system he advises only need to review HZ online
cases since that date.

MMS said not sure that is correct. HB currently looking at Misra transcript to see
what GJ said. Think it likely to contain ref to Misra bug. GM suggests BAQC may
well have advised on basis of incorrect assumption. MJS said would call tomorrow.
BAQC suggests only Hz online cases on spreadsheet. MJS said that we need to

put all cases on to ensure that none are missed. Anticiapte that POL may well
remove lines of irrelevant cases later.
