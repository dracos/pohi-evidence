Prosecution case

3. The defendant, Daljit Singh Benning, was during the relevant period,
10/07/2006 — 30/04/2009, a sub post office manager at Harston Sub Post

Office.

4. On 11" December 2008 an audit took place at Harston Sub Post Office.

5. On the date of the audit the auditor found a total shortage of £22,084.99 made

up as follows:

£2,688.90 (-) identified as a difference in cash figures
£17,876.96 (-) identified as a difference in stock figures
£920.33 (-) identified as a difference in postage stamp figures
£598.80 (-) identified as a difference in foreign currency figures

£22,084.90 (-) TOTAL

6. Mr Benning, in his interviews, conducted under the provisions of the Police

and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the relevant Codes of Practice, on the 23

December 2008 said that:

He was the manager of the sub post office and worked for his brother in
law, Amarjit Boora, who was the sub post master

Mr Boora does not work in the post office.

When the shortages were put to him he said that he could not
understand them.

He had been told of several transactional corrections in relation to his
scratch card sales and had settled one for £7000 with a cheque from his
mother and cash from the shop.

He did not check everything when he did a balance, “I just skim
through everything and just do the stamps and the cash.”

He never took POL money for his own use

7. Following the interview further enquiries were conducted. Which showed that
there were six lottery transaction correction notices served on the post office
totalling £5,066.47. This put the shortage to £27,151.46.

8. Mr Benning was further interviewed, again conducted under the provisions of
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the relevant Codes of Practice,
on the 27" April 2009. He said that:

— He did not understand why some packs of scratch cards had been
booked in properly when others had not.

— He did not know why the balance wasn’t in credit when cards had been
activated and sold but not booked in.

— Nothing untoward had been going on.

— He admits falsifying two of his trading statements.

— He does not know where the money has gone.

Defence case

9. In interview the defendant denies taking POL money but admits entering false

figures into Horizon on two occasions.

10. Despite these admissions a not guilty plea was entered but no defence

statement was served.

. The defendant served a basis of plea which admitted “temporarily” adjusting
the accounts at Harston Sub Post Office to identify a smaller figure than the

actual figure.

12. The Judge sentenced on the basis that the defendant was “covering a loss, not

stealing.”

Discussion

13.

14.

This case was dealt with by way of a guilty plea at the eleventh hour before the
trial. Whilst no defence statement was served there are a number of letters on
file that ask for further clarification on the way that the figures were arrived at

and details about the helpline

Whilst there is no direct attack on Horizon I have little doubt that in a case
such as this, where the defendant was professing almost to the door of the trial
not to know how the shortages had occurred, we would have disclosed the

issues referred to in the Second Sight Interim Report.

. It is my view that this defendant would be hard put to found an appeal against

either conviction or sentence in this case as he admitted submitting false figures
on two occasions in interview, pleaded guilty on a basis that must have been on
instruction and was sentenced on the basis that he had not stolen the money but
was covering a loss. Nonetheless where a defendant pleads guilty as late in the
day as this one has there is always a concern that the plea was tendered in a
spirit of pragmatism rather than an acceptance of guilt and such a plea might
not have been tendered in this case had the defence had material upon which
they could have mounted an attack on the Prosecution’s figures. It is my view
that we should disclose the Second Sight Interim Report to those who were
acting for Mr Benning in order that they can consider and advise upon his

options.

Conclusion

16.

This is a case in which, had we been possessed of the material at the relevant
time, we would have disclosed to the defence the matters identified in the
Second Sight Interim Report during the trial process. It is my view that we are
still under a duty to make those instructed by Mr Benning aware of the

contents of that Report and they should be written to accordingly.
