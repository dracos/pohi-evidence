GUILDFORD CROWN COURT
TRIAL - 15TH MARCH 2010E)
URGENT
David,

Thank you. I would be grateful if Mr Jenkins is asked the following:-

1 In relation to the Eleanor Nixon Statement, the information we received that although Maureen
Lyme states she cannot remember specific Offices she has stated that pre August 2005 Offices were
using a separate system for debit / credit card transactions called Streamline. Offices would Put debit
/ credit cards through this system and produce a receipt, which could be keyed into the Horizon
terminals.

Some Postmaster / Clerks would key in the information into Horizon as cash, instead of debit / credit
cards resulting in a Shortage in Offices. If Post Offices contacted Chesterfield at the time any Branch
discrepancies were dealt with, and sorted out with the individual Post Offices.

Therefore the problems were results of incorrect account produce and not a problem with the Horizon
system. No information is available for any Correction Notices pre August 2005. So the Nixon
statement is unlikely to have any relevance for our present case of Misra.

2 The areas where Mr Jenkins ‘says for POL to respond should be deleted from his statement
Mr Jenkins needs to comment on the third interim report received from the Defence Expert

The quality of training uf SPMs is obviously outside Mr Jenkins expertise. However I wonder if he
might be prepared to comment on how it might be possible to examine the Horizon data to investigate
mistakes.

We are keen that the Defence are given suggestions as to how they can efficiently test their theories
against the Horizon data. We do not want them to say that they will not have time before the Trial.
We anticipate that it would not be very difficult to test their theories against a short but represented
‘Span of data example from the months when Mrs Misra has admitted to false accounting. (15th
November 2006 to 14th December 2006, 16th May 2007 to 16th June 2007, 14th November 2007 to
15th December 2007 and 9th January 2008. It would be helpful if Mr Jenkins could consider practical
and efficient ways in which the Defence might be able to test their theories.

lalso refer you to my E-Mail to you of Friday 5th February 2010 at 15.39 Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.
Thank you in anticipation of your help.

Kind regards.
