ROYAL MAIL GROUP plc -v- TAHIR MAHMOOD
BIRMINGHAM MAGISTRATES’ COURT - 12 OCTOBER 2005 AT 2.00 P.M.
CASE 0506/0061

The committal papers have been approved and served on the Defence Solicitors and
Court. A copy has been supplied to my Agents, John H Dove, Solici

r yho has been instructed to conduct the committal
proceedings. I wou e grateful if the original statements could either be taken
to Court on the date of the proceedings or sent to my Agents prior to the
committal proceedings.

It has been noted that the Schedule of Unused Material has been submitted. Can you
confirm in due course whether there is any material which might undermine the case
for the prosecution against the accused or indeed may assist the accused and notify
this to Miss McFarlane on her return from annual leave. She can then no doubt deal
with the unused evidence and serve prior to the committal proceedings.

If there are any difficulties in the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me at this
Office.
