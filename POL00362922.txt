ENTRUSTMENT OF POST OFFICE LIMITED WITH THE DELIVERY OF
CERTAIN PUBLIC SERVICES

The UK Government is required by paragraph 11 of the Community Framework for
State Aid in the form of public service compensation (2005/C 297/04) to entrust Post
Office Limited with services of general economic interest through an overarching
ministerial instruction. This letter contains this instruction.

Post Office Limited is required to provide a network of Post Office branches to make
available the services of general economic interest detailed in Annex A. Post Office
Limited is entrusted with the delivery of these services of general economic interest
using its network in accordance with the contractual terms which apply to each service.

Specifically, the services listed in Annex A are provided under commercial contracts
entered into by Post Office Limited and the Government Department or body
purchasing the service. In the case of universal postal services, the services made
available at Post Office branches are ones which the universal service provider (Royal
Mail Group plc) is required to provide under the terms of its postal service licence.

The entrusiment of the delivery of the services set out in this letter to Post Office Ltd
does not replace or change in any way contracts and other agreements under which the
terms of the provision of the individual services are made. As stated above, the purpose
of this letter is to meet our obligation to entrust these services of general economic

interest to Post Office Limited in accordance with the letter from the European
Commission of 23 February 2006 giving clearance to State Aid notification N166/2005
(the “clearance letter”).

We confirm that Post Office Limited’s public service obligation extends to maintaining
the rural network beyond its optimum commercial size until 31 March 2008. The basis
of Government funding for the non-commercial rural network up to 2008 is set out in
the European Commission’s clearance letter.

The Community Framework for State Aid in the form of public service compensation
(2005/C 297/04) paragraphs 20-23 further requires that the UK Government ensures no
over-compensation. We will continue to arrange for independent audit of the social
network payment (including the accounting principles and figures) at the end of the
financial year in which monies have been paid. This will cover the net loss in rural non-
commercial branches calculated on a fully attributed costs and benefits basis under
general accounting procedures. In accordance with the Community Framework, any
overpayment will be required to be repaid to the State, subject to the provisions of the
Community Framework.
