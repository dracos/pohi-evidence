Thank you for your responses on this. Can you let me know the current position in relation to the sections highlighted
yellow? A few thoughts:-

can we do something similar to what we did with the KELs for the PEAK/TfS systems?

what manual analysis would you need to do to work out how many OCPs there are and can it be done by
Wednesday?

what are OCRs used for?

Kind regards

Jonny

As discussed on the call just now, please can you let us know what the art of the possible is in relation to the following
requests:-

v) PEAK and/or TfS records where the error or issue resulted in financial impact to either Post Office or a
Subpostmaster.

[Matthew Lenton] Whilst this type of action may have been taken by SSC it would have been in the
context of an individual incident. All incidents are recorded but the system was designed to manage
individual operations not for statistical reporting for when a particular action has been taken by a

Support Consultant. Fujitsu will be able to answer questions on individual branch queries where the data
is still available.

Is it possible to provide a dump of the entire PEAK database, which he can run up on SQL server or the appropriate
DBMS? Or could we give the experts access to the PEAK / TfS systems?

I rr eee

vi) PEAK and/or TfS records for any Claimant who has a record including any audit data for the period (at least a
month) of the PEAK/TES record.

[Matthew Lenton] We would need to know which claimants; we would then need to carry out the search
for each claimant, this is a time consuming manual task.

As above.

viii) A copy of any Master Service Change ("MSC") OR Operational Corrective Requests ("OCR") OR Operation
Control Procedures ("OCP") [as outlined in POL-0074909] where the data to be changed has had a financial impact on
Post Office or where they relate to fixing a peak.

[Matthew Lenton] We know that there are in excess of 18,000 MSCs and would predict that there are
eee OCRs

would not be relevant to this as they would not be used for any such change.
How many MSC, OCR, and OCP are there? By what means could they be provided to the experts?

I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards
