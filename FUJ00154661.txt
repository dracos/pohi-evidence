Thanks - This has been widely discussed in the team already and even before the judgement we have made some

You may find this interesting reading. Keith thought the Judge a good chap because of his use of algebra in his
judgement!! POL is please with this helpful judgement which they will quietly publicise to dissuade others. However, one
item took them by surprise from Ann Chambers’ evidence. She talked about information from Tivoli logs, which whilst
helpful evidence, had not been previously disclosed and which should have been i.e. full disclosure means full disclosure.
Our Security team should take notice.
