Subject: Letters to Post Office

Michael, Paul, Nigel, lan,

Please find attached the latest tranche of letters for Post Office - one from Michael to Paula and another from Paul to
Lesley.

We currently find ourselves in place where their narrative is less concrete than ever. Post Office are seemingly
oblivious to what’s at stake, and, at the very least, we need to make our position clear with respect to what the issues
are.

Target is to send these this week. lan I will defer to your guidance with respect the legal implications this content
presents, and any edits required. Otherwise I will set up a 30 min call, so we can run through together.

Asa side note, Alice Perkins (Chair POL Board) announced she was stepping down from the Board over the weekend.
