Hi Pete

I believe these are additional to the ones already completed for 2” sight, if I recall correctly we agreed

that if any additional information was required then this would be charge able — please advise how you

wish to progress the charging for this as we have no CP etc to charge against now

Regards
Donna

Hi Penny,

Gareth has asked me to retrieve the below information, however it needs to be charged against
the 'Second Sight' CP would you by any chance be able to advise on how much cover is left on
that CP or how I can find out?

Thanks
Raj

Raj,
Please can you retrieve similar info for the following Branches:
1. FAD 327518 (Yetminster Outreach Services) between 1* January 2011 and 31% December 2011.
2. FAD 255518 (Chetnole) between 1° January 2011 and 31% December 2011. Please note, I
suspect that this branch has never traded and so don’t be surprised if no data is found (but I
would like that confirmed please)!

3. FAD 171937 (Liss) between 1* July 2009 and 30" September 2009.

This work should be chargeable to the “Second Sight” CP I mentioned yesterday. If there is no more
cover on that then please let me know and I'll take it up with Pete Newsome.

Regards

Gareth

Raj,

There was a significant bug on HNG-X that affected about 14 branches that was identified earlier this
year that is causing some interest with high levels of management in POL and Fujitsu.

Anne Chambers has done some detailed analysis based on info in BRDB / BRSS, but I think it would be
helpful to pull back the transaction logs for the relevant periods to confirm the analysis.

Please can you get data back for Branch 011458 (by that I mean the normal ARQ extracts, plus the raw
XML files and filtered and unfiltered events) for the following time periods:

1. 1 November 2010 to 10" January 2011
2. 1 January to 12" February 2012
3. 1 January to 10" February 2013

Do you need anything more formal that this email?

V'd appreciate an estimated time frame for retrieving this asap.
Thanks

Regards

Gareth
