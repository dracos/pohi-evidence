Subject: Postmaster litigation - Board sub-Committee briefing. CONFIDENTIAL AND SUBJECT TO LEGAL PRIVILEGE. DO NOT

Attachments: image001.png; DRAFT HIT Risk assessment table 20-2-2019.docx

All

As referred to in my email yesterday, I attach a draft risk assessment prepared by our external legal team of the
likelihood/impact of the different outcomes on the questions being posed through the Horizon Issues Trial which we can
discuss at the Board sub-Committee call tomorrow.

As flagged in the document itself, this is a ‘best guess’ assessment and should not be taken as an accurate forecast of the
outcome.

Kind regards,

Jane
