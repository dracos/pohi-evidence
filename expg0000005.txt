INTRODUCTION


1.   This is the addendum to my second report prepared for phase 4 of the Post Office
     Horizon IT Inquiry, a statutory inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005, which focuses on
     "action against Sub-Postmasters and others: policy making, audits and investigations,
     civil and criminal proceedings, knowledge and responsibility for failures in
     investigations and disclosure". In short, so far as is presently relevant, the Inquiry
     seeks to consider investigations undertaken by and prosecutions brought by the Post
     Office against Sub-Postmasters, managers and assistants where shortfalls and
     discrepancies in branch accounts had been identified through the use of the Horizon
     computer system.


2.   The analysis in my second report related to the actual application in a series of cases
     of the Post Office policies I have seen, and more significantly the application of the
     wider framework for investigation and prosecution with which the Post Office
     accepted that it was expected to comply and which I analysed in my first report. I was
     asked to assess this actual application through a detailed analysis of 22 actual cases
     investigated and prosecuted by the Post Office in the period of the Inquiry's focus,
     namely between 2000 and 2013. In each case, I considered, with the assistance of
     Catherine Brown and Sebastian Walker, the papers that have been provided to us by
     the Inquiry relating to those cases, to identify, where possible, the progress of and
     decisions taken in the course of the Post Office investigations, the charging decisions,
     and prosecutorial decisions taken thereafter and the process of disclosure. As I
     explained in the introduction to my second report, I had only been provided with
     material relating to 20 of the intended 22 cases at the time of its completion. This
     addendum addresses the final 2 cases.


3.   I will throughout this report refer to the Post Office, so as to encapsulate a number of
     legal entities that have existed in the period with which I am concerned. The materials
     that have been provided to me for this purpose are addressed in the appendix to this
     report. The required declarations that are set out in appendix 1 to my second report
     apply equally to this addendum.

4.     I set out my conclusions at length, based on the 20 cases I had then considered, in my
       second report. Those conclusions are not altered by the consideration of these 2 further
       cases. In summary, there were issues with the scope of the investigation in each case,
       in relation to many of the same reasonable lines of enquiry. These areas included, but
       were not limited to, the investigation of whether there may have been errors in the
       operation of Horizon to explain the losses with which those cases were concerned. The
       charging decisions that I have seen in these cases were very limited, without analysis
       of the evidence against the elements of the offences charged, or any reference to or
       analysis of the public interest. Decisions were made to charge theft with very little
       analysis of how that offence was made out. Disclosure was undermined from the
       outset by the limitations to the reasonable lines of enquiry pursued by the
       investigations, and by a failure to identify or disclose material relating to the operation
       of Horizon that was both capable of undermining the prosecution case and assisting
       that of the defendant.


JANET SKINNER


5.     Janet Skinner was 35 years old at the time that she was investigated, and was the Sub-
       post mistress at North Bransholme Post Office in Humberside. She had worked for the
       Post Office since 1995.


6.     On 5t" January 2007, in the Crown Court at Kingston upon Hull before His Honor
       Judge Thorn, Janet Skinner pleaded guilty to one count of false accounting. A further
       count of theft was ordered to lie on the file. The alleged shortfall was £59,175.39. On
       2nd February 2007, she was sentenced by His Honour Judge Barber to nine months'
       imprisonment. On 29th August 2007, she was ordered to pay a confiscation order in the
       sum of £11,000 and to pay compensation to the Post Office in the same amount, out of
       the proceeds of the confiscation order.


7.     In the proceeding before the Court of Appeal in Josephine Hamilton v Post Office1, Mrs
       Skinner was one of those in category B, "in respect of whom POL accepted that this court
       may properlyfind that the prosecutions were an abuse of process within category 1, but resisted
        the appeals insofar as they are based on category 2 abuse. "

Investigation


8.     As in other cases, there is an investigation summary2, prepared for the investigator
       and intended for the contract manager and others, which provided some help as to the
       lines of enquiry that were pursued. The paperwork here does not identify specifically
       who performed the roles of senior investigator, investigator or disclosure officer for
       the purposes of the CPIA. It is therefore difficult to assess the performance of these
       roles by reference to the person who was actually expected to undertake them, and to
       identify whether the need for someone to do so was properly appreciated.


9.     On 30th May 20063, the Rural Support Officer attended the sub-post office to verify cash
       on hand in the light of an increase in overnight cash holdings. She identified a loss.
       Mrs Skinner had volunteered to her that there would be a £40,000 shortage of cash.
       She said she could not explain the loss, but suspected a member of staff, Kathryn
       Ayres.


10.    An audit was undertaken on 31st May, and a shortage of £59,175.39 was identified in
       the cash on hand. Post Office Investigators Dianne Matthews and Steven Bradshaw
       attended the branch. It appears from her questionnaire response for Second Sight in
       March 20144 that Mrs Skinner had reported the losses to her regional managers, and
       told them that she could not explain their cause, and that the audit followed this.


11.    Mrs Skinner was interviewed on 1st June 20065. The interview should have occurred at
       the post office, but in fact happened at Bransholme police station because the tape
       recorder was not working. Mrs Skinner declined the assistance of a solicitor, and also
       did not have a friend with her, although the transcript is silent as to whether she was
       offered one until the third interview6. In her questionnaire response for Second Sight
       in March 2014,
                    7 Mrs Skinner said that the investigators assumed that she had stolen
       the money "automatically", because Horizon recorded a loss.

12.      In her interview under caution, Mrs Skinner said that she was very experienced in the
         use of Horizon, having been the first manager in the Hull area to migrate to it, and she
         had acted as a contact point for others who had issues with it. She stated that the losses
         had begun in January 2006 when the completion of the balance revealed a shortage of
         £7500. She considered this too high to be an error. She said that she did not declare
         them as she could not afford "to put it right", and had sought to conceal it. She had
         spread the loss around the denominations in the cash on hand. She had not called
         when the losses appeared because she knew that she would be required to pay them
         back. The losses had gone up and up for 5 months.


13.      She had told her staff that there were losses and that they should be careful what they
         were doing, but she had not shared the extent of the losses. She believed that one of
         her members of staff, Kathryn Ayres, had stolen the money, a suspicion in part
         predicated on the belief that such a large amount of money "just doesn't go missing".
         She also pointed to the fact that Ms Ayres had keys to the post office and its safe
         because she lived closest, and that a number of customers had complained that Ms
         Ayres had shortchanged them. She had confronted Ms Ayres who had denied it. She
         accepted that she had not taken action to stop Ms Ayres from taking money. She
         further accepted that she had not taken control of the situation as she should.


14.      In terms of investigative steps, the investigators obtained Mrs Skinner's consent
         during interview for her home to be searched and for her financial position to be
         investigated. The Report suggests that no search was undertaken, but some financial
         checks were undertaken (which are addressed below).


15.      The investigators also spoke to Mrs Skinner's employees. A statement was taken from
         each. None, including Ms Ayres, was interviewed on tape or under caution, despite
         the suspicion that Mrs Skinner had cast on her. This at least suggests that the
         investigators had rejected Mrs Skinner's suspicions of theft by one of her staff before
         they had spoken to them. This accords with the assessment in the Investigation
         Reportx: "although Mrs Skinner states she has not stolen the money, I do not suspect the staff
         of having any involvement in this case. I have no reason to doubt the honest (sic), integrity and
         reliability of these witnesses". That said, there is some suggestion in the case Progression

       interviewed, and it is not clear at what stage that decision was changed.


16.    In summary:


       (a) Colleen Kates" said that Mrs Skinner completed the balances for the branch. She
           told staff not to declare the cash on hand as it would not be accurate until the
           balance at the end of the month. Mrs Skinner was "quite fiery" about losses, and
           she recalled Ms Ayres having to repay a loss of £1400.
       (b) Theresa Holmes12 was aware that there had been losses, but was not told of a loss
           exceeding £100. She also recalled Mrs Skinner saying not to declare the cash on
           hand as it would not be accurate until the balance at the end of the month. She did
           not recall seeing a discrepancy for cash on hand on the system.
       (c) Wendy Lye1113 said that Mrs Skinner always did the cash declarations, and said
           there were several times when the branch ran out of cash. She received calls
           regularly from the cash centre as to why the amounts required for the branch had
           been increased. She said she was aware that Mrs Skinner had a number of financial
           issues.
       (d) Katherine Ayres14 said she noticed a number of procedural changes when she
           returned from being off work for a period of 6 months. She confirmed a loss of
           £1000, which she had to pay.


17.    In this regard, the Court of Appeal observedt5 that "the prosecution relied on the evidence
       of three of the four other members of staff but we are not persuaded that their evidence was
       capable of materially advancing the prosecution case." The evidence of these witnesses,
       taken at face value, was that they had not stolen the money. In that respect they were
       in no different position to Mrs Skinner who similarly denied taking it. There was no
       evidence that they had benefited, but there was equally no evidence that Mrs Skinner
       had done so.

18.     The Second Sight review of the case in 201516 observed that "it is unclear whether or not
        the investigators made any further enquiries regarding the staff members in question". There
        was evidence, as noted in the Investigation Report17, that transactions had been
        undertaken using the terminals of Ms Ayres and Ms Holmes that each denied
        responsibility for and asserted had been undertaken by Mrs Skinner. That is, however,
        consistent with Mrs Skinner's account of covering up unexplained losses. It is also of
        note that in their response to Mrs Skinner's questionnaire in 201418, the Post Office
        recorded that there was no record that two of the employees had been registered or
        vetted for the Horizon system (as was required at the time). There is no reference to
        that in the investigation, or in disclosure arising from it.


19.     It appears that financial enquiries were made in relation to Mrs Skinner. The
        Investigation Report noted that Mrs Skinner's sole source of income was her
        employment and that her partner was unemployed. She had £2000 of direct debits on
        her account. The report goes on "from statements taken and also information received via
        Inland Revenue and credit checks, it appears that Mrs Skinner has severe financial problems".
        It is clear that enquiries had been made in relation to County Court judgments and
        Inland Revenue records. It is also clear from the Report that the majority of the
        information about Mrs Skinner's finances came from others at the branch. There was
        no acknowledgment that they might have had reason to emphasise the financial
        difficulties of another suspect.


20.     That assessment accords with the extent of financial enquiries that had to be
        undertaken for the purposes of the post-conviction confiscation proceedings19. An
        email from the financial investigator in May 200720 suggests that the detailed
        assessment of where the money in Mrs Skinner's bank account had come from
        occurred for confiscation rather than as part of the pre-charge investigation. Whilst it
        is perhaps inevitable that greater focus on a suspect's assets will occur when the focus
        is on securing those assets, the enquiries here do suggest that pre-charge enquires had
        been superficial. This is concerning where the primary source of information about

       Mrs Skinner's finances was an employee who was herself subsequently investigated
       for theft from the Post Office21.


21.    It appears that there was some interrogation of Horizon data. The Investigation Report
       noted that "the Horizon data has been requested", and various activities and transactions
       were addressed, for example use of the terminals of two employees which they denied.
       The Case Progression Notes22 refer to "Horizon disc received" on 14th June 2006. As
       the Court of Appeal observed23: "...it is not now known what it contained or whether it was
       disclosed to the defence". It is not clear from the Report the extent to which data was
       either obtained or analysed, but there is nothing in the Report to suggest any check
       was made as to the reliability of the system as it operated at the branch. That accords
       with Mrs Skinner's questionnaire response for Second Sight in March 201424, in which
       she asserted that "at no stage was the Horizon system investigated", and with the
       assessment of the Second Sight review25 that no one had given active consideration to
       the possibility of errors in the operation of Horizon.


22.    It is of note that the Post Office response to Mrs Skinner's questionnaire26 asserted
       "Post Office has not seen or found any evidence to suggest that there were any issues with the
       branch's Horizon system, or that this was raised as a concern by the Applicant during her
       tenure or interview as she claims". It is not clear the basis for the assertion that no
       evidence was "found" of issues, as no examination for such issues appears to have
       been undertaken. The response also asserted that "because the Applicant had inflated the
       cash figures, the investigation would have been unable to identify when or where the shortfalls
       arose". It is not clear how this squares with the failure to investigate the reliability of
       the Horizon system, or whether faults may have led to losses being asserted
       incorrectly.


23.    The Investigator's Report also noted that "Mrs Skinner did not contact the Network
       Business Support Centre or seek guidance from the retail line concerning the level of losses".
       This information appears to derive from Mrs Skinner's account in interview, there

       being no reference to any independent enquiries being made in this regard. It is at
       odds with material before the Court of Appeal, which noted27 : "Between 1 January 2004
       and 31 January 2005, Mrs Skinner made 116 calls to the National Business Support Centre.
       Some of those calls concerned Horizon faults and balancing." The latter accords with the
       Post Office response to Mrs Skinner's questionnaire in 201428, and the detail there
       suggests that evidence of contact with helplines was available at the time of the
       investigation but not sought, evaluated or disclosed. Moreover, the 2014 response does
       substantiate some "minimal" losses arising in transaction corrections. Whilst, as the
       Post Office pointed out, these were not in the "region of the level of losses that the
       Applicant described", there is no evidence that these were identified, investigated or
       disclosed at the time of the prosecution.


Charging decision


24.    A charging advice was provided by J. McFarlane, Principal Lawyer in the Criminal
       Law Division on 4th September 2006 29. She states "the evidence is sufficient to afford a
       realistic prosect of conviction" on the charge of theft of £59,175.3930. There is no analysis
       of the evidence in the advice. In particular, there is no consideration of the lack of
       evidence that Mrs Skinner did obtain the monies, or evidence of dishonesty. In keeping
       with her advice in the case of Hughie Thomas earlier in 200631, the advice also includes
       a second test "there is a medium prospect of success". As I observed in the case of Mr
       Thomas32: "It is not clear how this "Medium prospect" is reconciled to the evidential test in
       the Code for Crown Prosecutors."


25.    The advice identifies a list of evidence that is required. This includes "copy statement
       dealing with the accounts and explaining how the loss arose" and a statement "explaining
       the Horizon system". Neither of these appears to be a request for, or to recognise the
       need for, an analysis of the reliability of the Horizon data that showed there to have
       been a loss. There was no request for any further financial investigation as to where, if

       Mrs Skinner had taken it, the money had gone, and no question was raised as to the
       reliability of the Horizon data that revealed the loss charged as theft. There was no
       reference at all to the public interest component of the test in the Code for Crown
       Prosecutors. Given that this case concerned a 35 year old woman of good character
       who had worked for the Post Office in one role or another since 1995, the total absence
       of any public interest consideration is stark.


26.    The case Progression Notes33 record that an application was made for a summons on
       12th September 2006. There is no information as to what information was provided at
       the time that this was done.


Investigation of another employee at the branch


27.    It appears34 that after Mrs Skinner was charged, an investigation was undertaken into
       the conduct of Wendy Lyell, whose statement about Mrs Skinner had received
       considerable prominence in the Investigation Report35, especially as to Mrs Skinner's
       financial difficulties. In short, it appears that Ms Lyell had moved £2000 between stock
       units, and told a colleague that she had done so because she was concerned "over
       running out of cash before the remittance into the branch was received". Mrs Skinner's
       successor as postmistress reported that "£2000 was a loss which occurred prior to this week
       and was being hidden in the accounts". There are, therefore, clear parallels with the
       position of Mrs Skinner in terms of losses arising and the movements of cash to conceal
       them. There is also at least a suggestion of further unexplained losses in a period after
       Mrs Skinner had left the branch.


28.    This issue was communicated by the investigator to the lawyer on 24th November 2006,
       before Mrs Skinner's first appearance, which was scheduled for 12th December36. It was
       further reported on 4th December37 that Ms Lyell had been dismissed. She had accepted
       responsibility for a loss of £560 as a result of a cash error but not of £2000.

29.    On 6th December the lawyer communicated with the agents instructed to act at Mrs
       Skinner's first appearance at the Magistrates' Court. She observed: "whilst clearly the
       new information does not bear well with the prosecution case particularly as Miss Lyell is the
       witness, this does not necessarily mean that Miss Lyell is the only thief at the office. The papers
       in any event do reveal a very sophisticated method offalse accounting on behalf ofMiss Skinner
       in order to conceal a loss for which she raised little concern with her staff". Ms McFarlane
       then raises the possibility of a review after the case has been sent to the Crown Court
       or a delay to the sending of the case. She did not advocate one over the other. The
       initial case summary38 for the proceedings continued to include reference to, and
       apparent reliance on, Ms Lyell.


30.    What is concerning is that J.McFarlane's letter recognised that the Post Office could no
       longer rely on Ms Lyeil's account, without any apparent consideration of the effect
       that the loss of her evidence had for the prosecution case. In particular, this related to
       evidence of Mrs Skinner's financial position, which derived in large part from Ms
       Lyell. But beyond that, the allegation relating to Ms Lyell raised the possibility, put at
       its lowest, that losses were occurring that could not be attributed to Mrs Skinner of a
       similar kind to those which had led to her prosecution. Moreover, Ms McFarlane
       appeared to recognise that the evidence against Mrs Skinner was more consistent with
       false accounting with theft, and yet theft remained the offence with which Mrs Skinner
       was charged at that stage.


31.    Theft remained the charge at the stage that counsel was instructed in anticipation of
       the Plea and Case Management Hearing, which was fixed for 8th January 2007.
       Instructions to counsel 39 flagged up the issue re Ms Lyell in the same terms as quoted
       above. Those instructions, which thereby observed that there was a case of false
       accounting rather than theft, also asked for counsel to settle the indictment.


32.    When the case was listed on 5th January 200740 it is clear that a charge of false
       accounting had been added41. There is no material that addresses whether this charge
       was added because it was considered that it better reflected the indictment, and if so

       why it appeared together with the charge of theft which the reviewing lawyer had
       identified did not reflect the evidence. It is further clear that at that hearing Mrs
       Skinner pleaded guilty to that charge, and that plea was accepted.


33.    There is no material that I have seen, other than the observations of the lawyer about
       the issues raised by the allegation of theft against Ms Lyell, as to the basis on which
       that charge was considered acceptable. The fact that the lawyer had identified that
       "the papers in any event do reveal a very sophisticated method offalse accounting on behalf of
       Miss Skinner in order to conceal a loss for which she raised little concern with her staff",
       suggests that the false accounting charge was added to reflect what the evidence
       amounted to, rather than as a device to secure a plea in a case that was being
       undermined by the investigation into Ms Lyell. However, the absence of any other
       material makes it difficult to identify the evidential analysis that revealed dishonesty
       or a view to gain, beyond avoiding repayment of a loss that she could not explain, as
       against Mrs Skinner.


Confiscation


34.    In her interview, Mrs Skinner accepted falsifying the records to conceal losses, but
       denied that she had received any monies. She repeated that when she spoke to the
       author of the pre-sentence report42. Despite this, and the apparent acceptance by the
       reviewing lawyer that this was "a very sophisticated method offalse accounting on behalf of
       Miss Skinner in order to conceal a loss" (as the only basis I have seen for the acceptance
       of the plea to false accounting), the prosecution sought confiscation with a view to
       obtaining recovery of the amount identified as stolen in the theft charge.


35.    Those acting for Mrs Skinner argued that this represented an abuse of the court's
       process43. More particularly, it was submitted that the setting of a timetable for
       confiscation after they had accepted a plea to false accounting demonstrated that the
       prosecution was seeking to recover monies that they accepted that they could not
       prove that Mrs Skinner had stolen. The prosecution in their response44 "strenuously
       denied" taking advantage of a technicality in taking a plea to false accounting and then

       seeking recovery via confiscation. It was asserted that Mrs Skinner was contractually
       liable to recoup losses, and that they did not need to prove that the monies were stolen
       to recover them.


36.    The application for a stay was refused45, and it was agreed between the parties that
       £11,000 of the £59,175.39 was recoverable, and an order made in those terms. The Court
       record46 states that Mrs Skinner was ordered to pay the Post Office £11,000 in
       compensation, "in default of any or all the balance of confiscation order". The confiscation
       order carried with it a term of 12 months' imprisonment in default.


Disclosure



37.    A schedule of non-sensitive unused material (equivalent to an MG6C) was prepared
       by the investigator, who was clearly also acting as the disclosure officer, and dated 16th
       November 200647. It includes material relating to the process by which statements were
       obtained from the employees at the branch, but no material that suggests any financial
       enquiries, beyond those touched on in the investigation report, no reference to
       enquiries with helplines or any enquiries as to the operation of Horizon. There is, on
       the material I have seen, no evidence that the disclosure officer drew the prosecutor's
       attention to any material the disclosure of which was uncertain48, or that the prosecutor
       had inspected the material49. The schedule is not signed or otherwise endorsed by the
       prosecutor to show that any such review was undertaken.


38.    There is a schedule of sensitive unused material (equivalent to an MG6D)50, which is
       similarly signed by the investigator/ disclosure officer, but it does not include any
       material.

39.    There is no material listed in the MG6C, or obviously the MG6D, that refers to the theft
       allegation against Ms Lyell. The lack of disclosure as to that is confirmed by the fact
       that the defence requested such disclosure in the context of the abuse of process
       application relating to confiscation after Mrs Skinner had pleaded guilty51.


40.    The Court of Appeal's assessment of disclosure was as follows52: "POL accepts that this
       was an unexplained shortfall case and that evidence from Horizon was essential to Mrs
       Skinner's case. Although there is reference to a 'Horizon data disk' in the exhibits, it is not now
       known what it contained or whether it was disclosed to the defence. It appears there was no
       evidence to corroborate the Horizon evidence. There was no proof of an actual loss as opposed
       to a Horizon-generated shortage. There was no investigation into the various Helpline calls
       made by Mrs Skinner. We are struck by the fact that POL failed to take these steps despite Mrs
       Skinner's long service to POL and her professional progress (doubtless reflecting her
       trustworthiness) from counter clerk to permanent SPM of North Bransholme Post Office."


Assessment

41.    There were a number of areas of concern in relation to the ambit of the investigation
       that led to Mrs Skinner being prosecuted initially for theft and ultimately for false
       accounting. In particular, these related to her financial position, the possible roles of
       others and the operation of Horizon. In relation to the first of these, as the extent of
       enquiries that were necessary at the confiscation stage illustrates, there appears to have
       been greater reliance on the observations of Mrs Skinner's colleagues than
       independent financial enquiry as to the state of her finances. This is of concern not
       least because those others themselves ought to have been considered as potential
       suspects, rather than just as witnesses. That approach in turn is of concern where one
       was named as a possible suspect by Mrs Skinner and another came under investigation
       for similar conduct during the currency of proceedings against Mrs Skinner.


42.    It is unclear what Horizon data was obtained during the investigation, although
       clearly some was. As with, for example the case of Hughie Thomas, some steps were
       taken to obtain material that would allow for a review of the operation of Horizon
       were looked into, but there were important limitations to that investigation which

                                                                                               EXPG0000005




       undermined its effectiveness. It is unclear whether the limited material that was
       obtained was disclosed, to allow the defence to make their own investigations, and
       further unclear whether any actual investigation was made of the material obtained or
       more broadly as to the operation of the system.


43.    The charging decision was in September 2006, and thus before the first explicit
       reference to the Code for Crown Prosecutors being the test to be applied53. The test
       that was actually applied does not appear to have been that contained in the Code.
       Whilst the prosecutor stated there was a realistic prospect of conviction, she then
       identified there being a "medium prospect of success". This, therefore, appears to be
       same test as had been applied by Mr Singh in the case of David Blakey and by this
       lawyer, J. McFarlane in the case of Hughie Thomas. As in that case, it is difficult to
       understand how a medium prospect of success and a realistic prospect of conviction
       are to be equated, such that a decision was reached to prosecute. The charging decision
       does not contain an analysis of the evidence relied on for that decision, and is silent as
       to how, on the evidence, it was determined that dishonesty and appropriation were
       established for the purposes of the offence of theft, and dishonesty and a view to gain
       were made out for the offence of false accounting. The public interest was not
       addressed at all.


44.    The limitations of that analysis are further illuminated by the approach to the
       investigation of losses attributed to Ms Lyell during the currency of the prosecution of
       her manager, Mrs Skinner. It was recognised at that stage that it undermined the case,
       and that it in particular called the theft charge into question, but it neither resulted in
       a review of the case or the change of charge at that time.


45.    The limitations to the investigation, as in other cases, fed directly into the limitations
       of the disclosure process. The extent to which material relating to the operation of
       Horizon was obtained, or contact between the branch and the helplines was
       investigated, fed into the failings of disclosure of material relating to such important
       topics. The review of disclosure did not identify outstanding lines of enquiry any more
       than it did outstanding disclosure.

JULIAN WILSON


46.    The late Julian Wilson was Sub-postmaster at Astwood Bank, near Redditch in the
       West Midlands. He was 59 years old at the time that he was investigated.


47.    On 15th June 2009, in the Crown Court at Worcester, Mr Wilson pleaded guilty to two
       counts of fraud. It appears that three counts of false accounting did not proceed. On
       3rd August 2009, he received a community sentence order with 200 hours of unpaid
       work. He was ordered to pay prosecution costs in the sum of £3,500.


48.    In the proceedings before the Court of Appeal in Josephine Hamilton v Post Office54, Mr
       Wilson was one of those in category B, "in respect of whom POL accepted that this court
       may properlyfind that the prosecutions were an abuse of process within category 1, but resisted
       the appeals insofar as they are based on category 2 abuse."


49.    Although in some respects the material in relation to this case is quite extensive, the
       majority relate to an action brought by Mr Wilson in 2011 in connection with the
       termination of his contract as a sub-postmaster5,, and the Second Sight Review in 2014,
       rather than the investigation or prosecution that led to his conviction. Given the
       limited material available in this case relating to the actual prosecution, it is difficult
       to be categorical about all of the areas that the Inquiry has asked me to consider.


The investigation


50.    As in other cases, there is an investigation summary56, prepared for the investigator
       and intended for the contract manager and others, which provided some help as to the
       lines of enquiry that were pursued. The paperwork here does not identify specifically
       who performed the roles of senior investigator, investigator or disclosure officer for
       the purposes of the CPIA.

51.       The investigation was started after an audit on 11th September 2008 uncovered a
          shortage of £27,811.9857. Mr Wilson told the auditors58 at the outset that there would
          be a cash shortage of around £27,000, which represented an accumulation of shortages
          over 5 years. He said that he had been inflating the cash on hand figures to achieve a
          balance on the weekly and then monthly trading period. The investigators attended
          the branch, obtained a signed statement from Mr Wilson to reflect the admissions he
          had made, and advised him of his rights in relation to interview. He requested both a
          solicitor and a friend. This was in accordance with what a proper application of the
          Post Office Interviewing Policy 59 required.


52.       Before the interview was held, a voluntary search had been undertaken at Mr Wilson's
          home address. According to the Investigation Report60, a record was made of the
          search in accordance with the Post Office Searches policy61.


53.       At his interview under caution62, Mr Wilson was accompanied by both his solicitor
          and a Federation representative. Mr Wilson said that he had encountered problems
          with balancing the trading statements for some time. He had raised problems with
          Horizon with his line manager and was told " there was nothing wrong with the system".
          He had otherwise not raised the issues that he was encountering as he had expected
          them to be spotted and there to be intervention, as he was declaring discrepancies but
          not their scale. He accepted that he had not told his line manager of losses that he could
          not reconcile. He had maintained his own running total of the discrepancies over 5
          years, and had provided information about the discrepancies to the Federation when
          they had asked for instances of issues with Horizon 2 years earlier. Mr Wilson was
          asked about the matters the investigators had identified in his financial statements, for
          example the scale of his overdraft and other financial difficulties. Ile denied that he
          had taken any monies from the Post Office.

54.    Mr Wilson did not just raise the issues with Horizon in his interview. In his resignation
       letter to his contract manager, he stated that he had raised the problem of misbalances
       on three occasions and received no adequate response. In an undated letter from the
       Contract Manager in response63, he replied "I can assure you thar in terms of the integrity
       of the Horizon accounting system Post Office Ltd has been using this system now for the past
       nine years. During that time it has been tested in both the criminal and civil courts and has not
       found to be wanting".


55.    In terms of investigative steps, statements were taken from the auditor, contract
       manager and investigator64. The interview record65 shows that a number of enquires
       had been made in relation to Mr Wilson's finances. The investigation report66 does not
       suggest any more, and thus no evidence of financial benefit to Mr Wilson through the
       taking of monies. This accords with the statement67 provided by the financial
       investigator, which only refers to bank accounts that were alluded to at the time of
       interview, or related to the issues raised during that interview.


56.    Similarly, there is no evidence that enquires were made as to whether Mr Wilson had
       reported any issues with the operation of the system, for example reporting any such
       issues to regional managers or contacting helplines. Mr Wilson reported that he had
       spoken to his line manager in interview, and in the context of both his 2011 civil
       action68 and his 2014 questionnaire for the Second Sight Review69, he alleged both that
       he had contacted the helpline on a number of occasions, and had reported issues to his
       manager. There is no evidence that any contact was made by the investigation with
       Mr Wilson's line manager despite his raising such contact, in connection with the
       operation of Horizon, in interview. This was clearly a reasonable line of enquiry. When
       it responded to Mr Wilson's Second Sight questionnaire in 201470, the Post Office
       expressed scepticism about such contact, and when it spoke to others who similarly
       could have had issues raised with them their memory was limited. This underlines the
       importance of checks having been made at the time of the investigation.

57.    Similarly, contact with heiplines, in particular, was a regularly identified line of
       enquiry, and one that arguably ought to have been pursued whether or not raised by
       the defendant in interview. In his 2014 questionnaire for the Second Sight Review71,
       Mr Wilson referred to contact with the helpline, which underlines why, even if not
       mentioned in interview, it would have been reasonable for the investigation to have
       checked whether there was contact. Approaching it from a different perspective,
       evidence of a lack of contact would have been relevant to whether there had been
       problems with Horizon (a point made in a number of the cases that I have reviewed),
       and logically therefore a check on whether the helpline had been contacted was a
       reasonable line potentially implicating or exonerating the suspect depending on the
       result. The fact that the Post Office was able to access records relating to helpline
       contact when it responded to Mr Wilson's Second Sight questionnaire in 201472,
       underlines that such records were available at the time of the investigation.


58.    Counsel instructed, Anthony Vines of Civitas Law, Cardiff, provided advice, dated
       22nd May 200973. In this he requested the production of the material underlying the
       asserted losses, and the errors in the records produced by Mr Wilson. He also
       requested certificates to satisfy the business records exception to the hearsay rule, in
       section 117, Criminal Justice Act 2003, and a statement from the investigator "that at
       all material times the computer was working appropriately and that there is no reason to doubt
       the accuracy of the information received" and "whether in his experience there are any issues
       as to the accuracy of the information provided from the Horizon software package". Mr Vines
       makes clear in his advice that he was not aware of any cases where Horizon had been
       called into question, but he did recognise the need to prove its reliability. The list of
       exhibits74 for the case shows that no Horizon material beyond various branch trading
       statements were adduced as part of the case against Mr Wilson.


59.    There is no evidence that this did cause any investigation in this regard. That accords
       with the assessment of the Court of Appeal 75: "POL accepts that this was an unexplained
       shortfall case and that evidence from Horizon was essential to Mr Wilson's case. Based on the

       papers available from the criminal proceedings, there is nothing to suggest any ARQ data was
       obtained. POL did not investigate any of the criticisms of Horizon made by Mr Wilson
       historically and during his detailed interview. There was no evidence to corroborate the Horizon
       evidence. There was no proof of an actual loss as opposed to a Horizon-generated shortage."
       That such material was required is demonstrated by the fact that it was recognised
       both that such material was required, and that it would be necessary to apply to Fujitsu
       to get it, in the context of the civil action brought by Mr Wilson in 201176.


Charging decision


60.    The nearest I have seen to a charging decision in this case is a Memorandum to the
       investigator, dated 6th January 2009, from Jamail Singh, senior lawyer in the Criminal
       Law Division77. He advises "the evidence is sufficient to afford a realistic prospect of
       conviction". He refers to a list of charges, which charged theft of the total shortage over
       a 5 year period, together with "specimen" charges of false accounting relating to a
       series of branch trading statements. Mr Singh indicates that the remaining loss can be
       addressed by a schedule of offences to be taken into consideration, and such a schedule
       was prepared78.


61.    The memorandum contains no analysis of the elements of either theft or false
       accounting, and thus no identification of the evidential basis for dishonesty, or the
       basis on which it could be said that Mr Wilson had taken money. The lack of evidence
       of theft in these respects may have underlined Mr Singh's observation that pleas to
       false accounting should be accepted "in view of his admissions to false accounting in
       interview under caution and denial of theft". That does not, however, make clear why a
       theft charge was considered appropriate save as a means of encouraging a plea to the
       alternative charge. Although Mr Singh asked for a statement to be obtained to explain
       the operation of the Horizon system, he did not ask for any enquiries to be made as to
       its reliability or the accuracy of the data. There was no reference to the public interest
       test.

62.    Counsel, Anthony Vines of Civitas Law, Cardiff, was instructed, and provided advice,
       dated 22nd May 200979. He drafted a five count indictment80 in which Mr Wilson was
       charged with 3 counts of false accounting, relating to 2 weekly cash accounts and the
       final business trading statement, and thus differing from the charges authorised by Mr
       Singh, and 2 counts of fraud by abuse of position, contrary to section 4, Fraud Act 2006.
       As his accompanying case summary81 explained, the false accounting charges sought
       to "cover 3 of the 4 years of admitted false accounting prior to the coining into force of the
       Fraud Act 2006", and the fraud charges "represent the 2 periods covered by the trading
       statement".


63.    Mr Vines' advice82 makes clear that he had drafted this indictment in the light of the
       fact that "this is not a straightforward case because of the difficulties in establishing theft and
       the fact that the charges of false accounting do not necessarily result in the claim to the full
       loss". He made clear that the indictment was designed to enable "a proper claim to be
       made for the full sum of £27,811" and to satisfy "the criminal lifestyle condition set out in
       s.75(2)(c) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 for the purposes of pursuing confiscation".


Court proceedings


64.    Mr Wilson's case was listed for plea and case management ('PCMH') on 15th June
       200983, and was covered by Richard Coles, Civitas Law in the stead of Anthony Vines.
       As he reported to those instructing him84, "in this case, the defendant was convinced that
       there was a systematic problem with Horizon as was raised in interview." That is reflected
       in his agreed basis of plea85, in which Mr Wilson stated that the losses occurred because
       of "staff or systemic errors" and not because the money had been stolen. He admitted
       inflating the cash on hand figures over five years to ensure that the accounts balanced
       but believed that the alleged shortfall - £28,551.98 - was due to problems with
       Horizon. Mr Coles, in his note from the PCMH, said that Mr Wilson had sought to
       plead to the fraud charges on the basis of the period from May 2007, and thus a loss of

                                                                                                    EXPG0000005




       £15,000, but that he had rejected this and ultimately the plea addressed the full
       shortfall. He indicated that he had not informed the judge that confiscation would be
       pursued, because that judge had previously indicated that compensation was "more
       suitable".


65.    In his 2014 questionnaire for the Second Sight ReviewS6, Mr Wilson explained that he
       was advised to plead guilty to false accounting on the basis that he was likely to be
       convicted, and that his wife and father-in-law's health concerns at that time led him to
       feel he had no choice. The hope of a lighter sentence for false accounting than for theft
       was also an identified factor.


66.    In fact, when Mr Wilson was sentenced a timetable for confiscation was fixed. It was
       observed by the Post Office's agent, John Dove, at the time87 that this "is likely to be pre-
       empted by the full reimbursement of the stolen monies" from the sale of the post office
       branch. It is not without relevance that the solicitor acting for the Post Officer referred
       to the monies as "stolen", even though neither the charges brought, nor Mr Wilson's
       basis of plea, reflected the theft by him of those monies. In fact, contrary to Mr Dove's
       prediction, there was a confiscation hearing88 at which an order was made for the full
       benefit figure of £28,434.95, comprising the full loss and RPI increase, together with
       prosecution costs. As was observed by the financial investigator, the Post Office
       therefore secured "a 102% recovery".



67.    This stance was justified by the Post Office at the time of the Second Sight Review89 on
       the basis that Mr Wilson's admitted false accounting had made it difficult to know if
       cash was missing, when it went missing, or which transactions had led to loss. As it
       observed "because the accounts in this case have been falsified it is not possible to distinguish
       between genuine errors and intentionally false claims". The Post Office further observed
       that a sub-postmaster is contractually liable to make good losses "hidden or caused by
       his inaccurate record keeping". This is a position which is, or should clearly be informed
       by other material that demonstrated errors in the Horizon system, as opposed to

        human errors. The Post Office in its response to the Second Sight inquiry observed that
        the loss was likely to have been caused by "human action (for example poor controls in
        branch and/or user error". The difficulty with this is that material showing an alternative
        explanation was relevant both to the decision to charge and decision to pursue
        confiscation just as it was the decision to decline mediation in the case of Mr Wilson in
        2014. That required that alternative explanation to be identified and considered. There
        is no evidence that such consideration occurred, and it will be for the Inquiry to
        determine whether at that time the alternative had been identified.


68.     Those acting for Mr Wilson had to seek an extension to the period in which the
        confiscation order was to be met because of difficulties encountered in selling the
        branch90.


Disclosure


69.     In relation to disclosure, there is no evidence in the material I have seen of the actions
        of a disclosure officer beyond a schedule of unused material (equivalent to an MG6C),
        which he signed on 18th March 200991. The content of this accords with the limited
        financial investigation that had been undertaken at the time that Mr Wilson was
        interviewed, and documents relating to that interview. It includes no material showing
        investigation of his training, contact with helplines or the operation of the Horizon
        system and, it follows, no evidence of disclosure in relation to such topics. The last of
        these was an issue raised by Mr Wilson's interview, and therefore a matter in relation
        to which the disclosure of material undermining of the prosecution case or of
        assistance to his ought to have occurred at the primary disclosure stage. In fact, it is
        not clear if it was reviewed by the Reviewing Lawyer and in fact disclosed to the
        defence. I have also very belatedly seen a schedule of sensitive unused (MG6D)92 and
        a disclosure officer's report (MG6E)93, both of which are blank/identify no material
        and thus add nothing either to the disclosure position or evidence of review.

70.    The advice from counsel, Anthony Vines of Civitas Law, dated 22nd May 200994, raised
       the question of whether issues had arisen in other cases in relation to the operation or
       reliability of Horizon. This appears to have resulted from a request to that effect being
       made on behalf of the defendant95. He advised that "I personally am not aware that
       Horizon has been found to be faulty in any respects but I would be grateful to have this point
       clarified. It is conceivable that other cases may have sought to take this point but in am not
       aware of this. If there are no issues about the system then of course a fair line can be taken. If
       there is material which is potentially disclosable then I am of course happy to advise". On the
       same topic, Richard Coles, Civitas Law, who prosecuted the PCMH96 advised that
       "consideration should be given to looking at the issue [of Horizon reliability] generally and a
       suitable employee from the organisation preparing a statement (for use in cases) that says that
       Horizon works perfectly well".


71.    Despite this issue having been raised both before and at the time of Mr Wilson's plea,
       there is no evidence of evidence of cross-disclosure of other cases where complaints
       about Horizon, even though the reviewing lawyers had personal knowledge of a
       number, at least by reference to those cases I have considered above.


72.    The relevance of such cross-case issues was highlighted in Mr Wilson's case by a letter
       his then MP, the Rt. Hon. Jacqui Smith MP. In her letter, sent to the CEO of the Post
       office in December 2009, she referred to issues with the operation of Horizon that had
       arisen in the case of Mr Wilson, and similar issues that had arisen in other cases
       including those of Hughie Thomas, Seema Misra and also referring to the Falkirk post
       office, which had arisen as an issue between experts in the Misra case. It is pertinent
       to observe that if such cross-case issues were obvious to Mr Wilson's MP, they should
       have been all the more obvious to those concerned in those cases who also played a
       role in that of Mr Wilson. Despite this, there is no evidence that cross-case disclosure
       was considered.

Assessment


73.   There are many features in common between the investigation undertaken in the case
      of Mr Wilson and that of Mrs Skinner. As in her case, there were very real limitations
      as to the extent to which reasonable lines of enquiry were identified or pursued
      relating to the financial position of the suspect, their contact with helplines and the
      reliability of the Horizon system. In relation to financial enquiries, as with the case of
      Mrs Skinner, the extent of investigations at the confiscation stage underlines the
      limitations to investigative enquiries. These are of concern where the question of
      whether the suspect took money from the Post Office is at the core of the investigation
      and enquiring after evidence of that money, or the lack of it, is therefore central.
      Similarly, where the case is predicated on Horizon data, the lack of investigation of the
      accuracy of that data and whether complaints were made as to the operation of the
      system at an earlier stage are also central.


74.   What makes the lack of investigation of such matters all the more concerning in the
      case of Mr Wilson is that his account in interview made each very clearly a reasonable
      line of enquiry. He denied taking the money, and asserted that there were issues with
      Horizon, and yet the obvious methods of testing that account, and of obtaining
      material that might either support or contradict it, were not pursued by the
      investigators. The failure to follow lines of enquiry identified by the interview is
      brought into sharp focus by the fact that Mr Wilson recounted exchanges with his
      managers about Horizon, and yet no enquiry was made of those managers to
      determine if they accepted his account. Equally concerning is the fact that they were
      not identified by the reviewing lawyer, whose role included the identification of lines
      of enquiry that ought to have been pursued. In Mr Wilson's case, it is right to note that
      counsel instructed identified the need to address the reliability of the Horizon
      material. However, his focus was as to meeting the requirements of the business
      records hearsay exception, and section 117, Criminal Justice Act 2003, rather than
      requiring the obtaining of the ARQ data to allow for the reliability of this material to
      be tested.


75.   The charging decision was again very limited in length and in scope. The charge of
      theft was identified as appropriate without any consideration of the elements of the




                                              26
                                                                                                EXP00000005
                                                                                             EXPG0000005




      offence, in particular as to evidence of appropriation or dishonesty. On one view, the
      fact that the reviewing lawyer advised that theft be pursued at the same time that he
      identified that a plea to false accounting would be sufficient accords with the view that
      theft was charged to encourage such a plea to false accounting. It is to counsel's credit
      that they identified that theft was untenable and advised that charges under the Fraud
      Act be brought instead. The fact that this advice was accepted with alacrity also
      supports the view that the theft charge should never have been there.


76.   What is concerning is that the focus at the stage that counsel advised as to the
      indictment was on the recovery of the loss. This concern also guided the prosecution's
      approach to the basis of plea that was advanced by the defendant and the decision to
      pursue confiscation to recover a loss of which the plea did not involve Mr Wilson
      accepting responsibility. The approach taken in this case, and indeed that of Mrs
      Skinner suggested that prosecution was viewed primarily as a mean to recover the loss
      identified by the system. In reaching the decision to seek confiscation, the prosecution
      was required to consider whether such a course was warranted, by reference to what
      was known about the financial position of the individual, and by reference to that of
      which the individual had been convicted. I have not seen evidence of such a thought
      process at work here.


77.   Once again, the limitations of the investigation led to the inadequacies of the disclosure
      process. Given the issues raised by Mr Wilson in interview, it was appropriate to
      obtain the underlying Horizon data both to test its reliability and to allow the defence
      to do so once it had been disclosed. It was appropriate to investigate whether Mr
      Wilson had sought to call heiplines, and to speak to his managers, to test whether or
      not he had been reporting problems at the time, and to at least disclose the results
      where they supported his account. It was appropriate to investigate Mr Wilson's
      finances to determine if there was any evidence of financial benefit to him, and if not,
      to at least disclose the results.


78.   Another important limitation so far as disclosure is concerned is that cross-disclosure
      between cases was raised as an issue on Mr Wilson's behalf by counsel, and identified
      by prosecution counsel as a relevant area of disclosure if similar issues as to the
      reliability and operation of Horizon had arisen elsewhere. There is no evidence that
      such disclosure occurred. Those making and reviewing prosecutorial decisions in this

case would have been aware of the issues that had arisen elsewhere, and the potential
at least for those issues to be relevant for disclosure here. There is no evidence that the
acted on that, or that proper disclosure of issues from earlier cases were either
identified or addressed.
