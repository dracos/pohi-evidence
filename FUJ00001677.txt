e CC/S/G/M - Gateway Counter in a Multiple Counter Site

This configuration will normally be installed at one of the counter
positions of all multi-counter outlets. It consists of the standard counter
PC configuration which is connected to the outlet LAN, together with all
the necessary communications hardware and software to enable the
outlet to communicate to the Pathway data centres.

¢ CC/S/C - Standard Counter in Multiple Counter Site.

This configuration will be installed at all the remaining counter positions
of a multi-counter outlet after a single CC/S/G/M has been installed. It
consists of the standard counter PC configuration which is connected to
the outlet LAN.

2.1.1.1 Back-Office Configurations

Some multi-counter outlets may also have one or more back-office configurations installed.
The number of back-office configurations to be installed is subject to AA Schedule A06 (Ref.
[3]). These outlets will be identified on the roll-out database.

Where required, this will consist of the gateway configuration, CC/S/G/M, which will now be
installed at the back-office location. Where more than one configuration is required in an
outlet, the second will be a standard counter configuration. All counter positions will then
have configuration CC/S/C installed.

All outlets will have a single office printer for printing A4 reports etc. An ink-jet or a laser /
LED printer will be provided. The number of each type of printer to be provided is subject to
AA Schedule A06 (Ref. [3]). The roll-out database will identify which type of printer is to be
installed at each outlet.
