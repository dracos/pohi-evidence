Purpose
The purpose of this report is to provide Business Service Management with a status report of problems managed by the
Problem Management team for the month of October 2001.

Context
The report will focus on the management of ‘open’ problems and provides details of ongoing development and operational
activity during the month.

Problem Definition / Classification

A ‘Problem’ :-

¢ isa record of an underlying cause which may result in Incidents;

¢ potentially exists when a defect in the specification, design, production, implementation, or use of any of the service
components results in any aspect of the service not meeting expectations;

e will be raised when the impact of the defect (e.g. the level and severity of the related incidents) is substantial enough to
warrant action to eradicate it.;

e will be deemed to exist when it is logged on a PON or ICL Pathway Problem Management system;

¢ will be closed when it has been agreed that the underlying cause has been fixed or removed.

2.2

The number of problems opened in October (27 ) was a bit above the recent average, primarily due to ‘Your Guide’ issues
(7 = 26% ). As usual, ‘Problem Offices’ accounted for a high percentage of the new problems (11 = 41% ). The “Your
Guide’ problems, whilst large in number do not reflect a major concern however - more an improvement in the visibility of
issues which are largely resolved quite quickly.

The larger pieces of work that Problem Management are involved in - often driving business conformance / activity have
not yet been included in our statistics. The process to deal with these is currently being defined, but for information
purposes, the main areas of activity have been :-

¢ Bad debts - involving Territories, Legal Services and Transaction Processing ;

e Part Time Outlets Data - establishing baseline info. and involved in establishing change control processes;

¢ Training for Holiday Relief staff - gathering baseline data to support case for National Training to deliver;

¢ Centralised reference points for Business policy - to improve visibility for PM and NBSC use.

On top of all the above, there has been a lot of activity this month in relation to the reorganisation of the Your Guide (YG)
centre and we are getting to grips with process changes that are necessary to support the reshaped infrastructure.

The key problems and issues which have provided the main focus for us this month were in relation to :-

Non Polling
The numbers have levelled out a bit and remain relatively low although still unacceptable - pending implementation of the

‘rectification plan’. A ‘lap top’ solution has been tested in a development environment and the ‘live environment’ test will
being carried out at one office during November. If all goes well, there will be a pilot in the South East involving 4200
offices (test will be at the worst 5 non poll offices per day in that region) and a full roll out (if the pilot is successful) in Jan -
March 2002.

24.1

Your Guide (YG ) Issues

As mentioned in the opening paragraphs, YG issues were more prevalent this month. The main problems were :-

e P10000592 White Screens

White screens picked up again after a major incident on 28 September, when Energis, concerned about network congestion,
invoked a service-related contingency and reduced the bandwidths - too far! 90% of the Horizon network was affected at
one stage, with a commensurate effect on Your Guide kiosks. Since then, Energis have continued to monitor the network
and have agreed to restore bandwidth to the previous level, except between 3 and 4 am, which is when the YG Kiosks all
reboot and try to contact the web server then white out when they can't.

¢ P10000632 Service Interruption 26/09/01

Meantime, two other causes of white screens were identified. The service interruption on 26 Sept related to a corrupt rules
base on the firewall; the security feature which determines access to the server failed, thereby forbidding access to
legitimate machines. An eventual hardware swap appears to have solved this one.

e P10000643 Failure of YG Network 06/10/01

The failure of the entire network on 6 October was due to another hardware problem, in that an entire comms switching
panel at Bootle data centre failed, therefore denying any communications at all between kiosk and server. Although
Horizon could continue to function via Wigan, there is no such back-up for Your Guide. In the absence of a report from
Nortel, the owners of the kit that failed, Energis have been asked to provide assurance that they have a plan to deal with
any such recurrence.

First Rate Issues

P10000567 Customers unable to contact First Rate
P10000571 ~~ Non receipt of pre-order currency in outlets
P10000630 Offices receiving incorrect First Rate orders

After a bit of stalemate and no real movement on these problems, a meeting took place on 8 October to get both visibility
and action.

¢ 567 - First Rate (FR) have had problems with the system crashing, but aren't in a position to renew the system due to lack
of funds associated with the current contract (Investment appraisal process is part of potential new deal). A suggestion
was made that they have a contingency plan and that NBSC would be that contingency and be paid accordingly - that is
now being looked into.

¢ 571 - Due to the low numbers of outlets being affected by this problem, the amount of failures falls within the failure rate
for the Special Delivery service, so although it is disappointing, it looks as though there isn't any more we can do.

¢ 630 - The database used by First Rate will be validated to make sure all office details are correct, and the process used at
the pick and pack centre will be checked to see where the failures are occurring and how they might be stopped.

Slow Running At Counters
The problem has been ongoing for a considerable length of time. The day to day slow running (navigating from screen to

screen etc.) has been difficult to prove and could be user perception. However, the Adjust Stock & Slow Rollover has been

known about since April.

e A fix was devised for the problem but a side effect of this was that the order of reports generated would be different.
POL therefore said that the fix was unacceptable as it stood.

e ICLP began working on the side effect to the fix. This had the effect of making the fix 'bigger' in size to the system.

¢ The Counter_S10R_DELTA package, which contains the 'Slow running Adjust Stock/ Balance snapshot' fix as one of its
components was piloted on 30/10/01. The pilot offices were to be monitored over the balance period and if the fix
proves successful, it will be released to the rest of the live estate - we are currently waiting for details of the success of
the fix.

Discussions with the Retail Line and Network Transformation teams indicate most areas make local arrangements such as using a generic "Territory"
stamp or one from a closed outlet. The Network Change Mgr. is looking at whether a new process is needed or whether these local practices can
become standard practice. The security arrangements will need to be looked into so that there is an audit trail of where each stamp has been used.
Due to the NCM's commitments with other issues, some of which have a higher financial priority, the next update has been agreed for 30/11/01.

Printer Failures &
Spares Supply
pXeteumem There are two identified causes of failure. Firstly, there is a buildup of static that does not earth properly, causing the printer to fail, and secondly
the printer heads are found to be dirty, perhaps as a result of being shipped in that condition. After a Divisional Alert was raised in ICL Pathway,
delivery of the spares that had been requisitioned was expedited, giving a total of 12, Whether this will be sufficient is being monitored. The printer
heads issue is being tackled on two fronts; the paper is no longer being pre-loaded, enabling a visual inspection of the heads before the printer leaves
the factory, and the engineers have been equipped with airspray canisters and will clean the heads as part of routine maintenance..

After the S10 software drop five outlets were having problems reversing Girobank transactions on the Horizon node that they were originally
processed through. They did however manage to reverse them on the gateway node. Potentially, all outlets with more than one terminal could be
affected, but to date it seems that only these five have . We haven't been provided with any reason why it should have only affected these outlets

nor has the root cause been identified.

The results of this month’s visits are currently being summarised.

Theresa Walsh has again been out and about on her PC liaison visits this month and feedback received
continues to be very positive. There are some interesting learning points arising for us and we are striving to
tackle these. Another initiative, linked to the ‘Service Charter’, is the establishment of OLAs to improve
links, accountability and ownership. It’s perhaps a bit early for this yet, but nevertheless it’s an opportunity
to build on what we have currently.

No changes this month !!

As outlined in both this month’s and the September PM status report, there are a few larger pieces of work
that Problem Management are involved in - often driving business conformance / activity. This activity is
largely invisible however to the statistics and as a result, we need to alter the way we approach this work to
ensure that it is recorded. We are looking at this during November as I feel it’s an essential change and
compliments the change activity arising from recent discussions with Business Continuity.

¢ I gave Paul Smith written recognition for his comprehensive work on the Data Extraction Tool user guide
- it was a very thorough and professional piece of work which will definitely benefit the team;

¢ Theresa received recognition at the PC meeting for her liaison visits which are proving to be very helpful
to them;

¢ I gave verbal recognition to both Michael Dadra (Network Audit) and Ijaz Bhatti (IAM) for their excellent
input and activity as Problem Co-ordinators. Indeed, Ijaz was one of the ‘founder members’ and has
continually played a very valuable and active role which has been vital to the success of the PC
infrastructure.

There is currently confusion about the correct procedure for cash declarations which has led to non-conformance. A small number of outlets have
eso ttoae been monitored for some time. The initial level of non-conformance was approximately 80% which was clearly ignorance of the correct procedure,
but there are also cases where outlets are refusing to follow the procedure. One problem that has been made clear is that of the cut-off time involved.

Solutions are now being looked at to address the issues.
