Andy,
I have reviewed MO25and have the following observations in respect of the section you highlighted for my attention:

1. I personally was not aware of this incident and given that we declared the two incidents to SS that they included in
their Interim Report I am surprised and somewhat concerned that internally this incident was not also raised.

2. L agree that SS will make mischief with this so we need to establish the facts quickly and our response to the obvious

questions from SS which will namely be:

- why was this incident not disclosed to them at the same time as the other two?

- how many other incidents has POL not disclosed to SS?

- how many Spmrs have suffered we shortfalls as a result of such incidents and are any of these Spmrs/former Spmrs
now applicants of the Scheme?

3. Having read the explanation of this incident within the POIR it appears that the Horizon system did as it is designed to
do and left a footprint with the result that the major incident process
was initiated. All affected branches were sent a memoview and no branch suffered a discrepancy as a result of this.

4. Lagree that Belinda needs to be aware of this so that the ground can be prepared - I have therefore cc'd her to this e-
mail. Belinda will probably want to discuss this particular incident with Lesley and determine why this incident is only now
coming to light. And if there are any other such incidents that we should be aware of.

For completeness I attach the POIR that I have tracked some changes to.

Thanks,
Angela

Angela, Andy,

I have spoken with the case handler on this case and we both share the view that this is not one of the bugs mentioned
within the interim report. It appears very similar to the "Payments and Receipts mismatch" problem highlight at clause 6.5
but the timings are wrong. That occurred in September 2010 whereas the issue in M025 occurred in February

2012. Fujitsu's report covering the incident is attached (and is also inciuded in the documents to send to Second Sight).

A much higher number of branches were affected by the 2012 incident (3008 as opposed to 2 in February 2010). 6,831
transactions were impacted (but ail identified}. However, my understanding is that no branch suffered a loss, including the
Applicants. The issue was detected by the safeguards in place and branches were notified

If you need any more information at this stage please let me know.

Best

Angela - I'm not familiar with the details of the two bugs raised in the first SS report. It that's correct, that would make
things much easier.

Andy ~ could you fiaise with the case handler to see if the issue below is one of the two bugs mentioned in para 6 of the
attached.

Thanks

Andy,

I've not had chance to read the POIR and realistically won't get to this until Weds pm but isn't this one of the two
incidents that we disclosed to SS as part of their interim report?

Angela
Please find attached the draft POIR on M025 for your review.

There is one point that I'd be grateful if we could discuss next week. In the report, we disclose a glitch in Horizon that
caused a problem impacting on 3000 branches. My understanding is that this did not impact directly on branch
accounting. Nevertheless, this is likely to get SS very excited. I've highlighted the relevant bit in yellow in the attached.

I think we may just need to think through how SS may respond to this so we have our story straight. May also need to
escalate to Belinda / Chris so that they are forewarned on this one.

Kind regards
Andy
