IT Contract Vendor Management Team
Maintaining a Supplier Relationship Matrix

Purpose

¢ The Supplier Relationship Matrix signposts stakeholders to their counterparts of the Vendor’s organisation

* The matrix articulates the responsibilities and interests of Post Office colleagues in relation to the management of
the services provided

Guidance

* The maintenance of the supplier relationship matrix is the responsibility of Vendor Managers

¢ Please ensure your suppliers have validated the information about their stakeholders and understand the
expectations on them with regards to communicating with individuals at the Post Office

¢ Please ensure that either Vendor or Contract Managers (CVMs) are aware of the interactions between the two
parties at all levels. This may be monitored at governance meetings as appropriate, CVMs cc’ in on emails etc.

* Please update the matrix as key account personnel change

¢ Please ensure an up to date version is maintained on the CVM sharepoint:
