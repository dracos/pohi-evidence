Subject: RE: Suspense accounts

Thanks for the email Rod, and apologies for not getting back to you yesterday. On the question of suspense accounts,
I had a chat with Al yesterday about how best to handle the information demands from Second Sight, and I think that
he is going to ask around today to see who would be best placed from the finance team to front the issue at the
forthcoming face to face meeting with them — they can be very unreasonable to deal with!

On the issue of a Zebra 3, my instinct is to hold fire, at least until we see where we have got to with Second Sight; to
date we have not mentioned to them any of the internal assurance work that we have done on the horizon system,
nor should we. We may decide that we want to do it further work for our own purposes, though that decision is a
little further down the track, I think.

Cheers

Chris

Hi Chris, Re Charles’ email about Suspense Accounts just now, do let me know and I'll follow up.

However, from my last discussions with Angela and Belinda we had been declining the requests for more information
about suspense, beyond what had already been shared. Has that changed now?

On other matters I spoke with Eddie and Adnan about Zebra actions today. Eddie is going to check in with you about
the original Zebra view of “independent review of branch data pipe controls to central systems”. In light of the
increasingly clear focus on branch specific examples as per mediation cases, and given that other Zebra actions lead to
further assurance within PO of the pipes, what would be your stance on that “Zebra 3” independent review action
now. Clearly my team and IT would need to engage to support it but we have not commissioned a third party review
and my sense is that the PO position is not to commission one.

Thanks, Rod

Hi Rod, I understand Chris A was after some info promised to 2nd Sight on Suspense Accounts. I don't have anymore
detail but my understanding is that you're dealing with this so if unclear maybe best to give Chris a ring.

Regards Charles
