In my previous statement I detailed the fact that on the 6" March 20061 was carrying out a
cash monitoring exercise. The list of branches with a high ratio of cash holdings to Payment
levels included South Warnborough Sub Post Office Branch (SPOB), Branch Code 092 904.

On that day, I telephoned South Warnborough SPOB and advised that there was far too much
cash in the branch and that our Cash in Transit service would call in, on the next scheduled
delivery day to collect the excess funds. I advised that we expected a return of £25,000.

! logged the details into our ReCALL logging system under the generic user name Kingmi01,
although my initials RP are entered at the end of the text, to show that I logged the entry. I
now produce an extract from the ReCaLL logging system, detailing five entries pertinent to
South Warnborough SPOB, between 06 March 2006 and 10 March 2006 as item reference
RP/O1.
