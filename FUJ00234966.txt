POA Operations Major Incident Procedure

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this Post Office Account major incident procedural document is solely to supplement the
major incident processes defined in the Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management Systems Major Incident
Procedure with any Post Office Limited specific requirements or requests.

This document outlines the management guidelines to be used for Major Incidents impacting the live
estate in communicating with Atos and Post Office Limited.

1.2 Owner

The owner of the Major Incident Management process at the local POA level is the Fujitsu POA Senior
SDM, Problem and Major Incident.

2 Guidelines and Interfacing to Atos

2.1 Guidelines

It is important to maintain a balance between:
a) Allowing the technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident
b) Avoiding unnecessary alerting of the customer

c) Assessing which incidents are major
2.2. Interfacing to Atos

¢ During the MAC Core Hours (Monday — Friday 08:00 — 20:00, Saturday 08:00 — 17:00) and Bank
Holidays 0800 — 1400 excluding Christmas Day. The MAC should be the first point of operational
contact between Fujitsu and the Atos Service Desk. The SMC are responsible for escalation of
incidents to the POA OOH Duty Manager. The POA OOH Duty Manager may initiate
communications with the Atos OOH Duty Manger. The SMC operate on a 24 x 7 x 365 basis.

e Any activity detailed in this document which is assigned to the MAC team is handed over to the
SMC outside the MAC Core Hours, with the exception of the above.

e The relevant technical teams who are aware of and monitoring a potential major incident must
call the appropriate Major Incident Manager (Duty Manager out of hours) as soon as possible.
This is not limited to major incidents alone, but applies wherever a state other than Business as
Usual has been detected. The Major Incident Manager must in turn communicate the potential
incident, to the Atos Service Desk for awareness and monitoring in Atos. This is usually done via
the MAC team in core hours.

e The Major Incident Manager (or Duty Manager out of hours) is responsible for communicating
both up the Fujitsu organisation and across (see appendix 9.3) to their counterpart in Atos.
Where this is impractical (e.g. leave, out of hours, unavailable), the initiative should be taken to
jump up the organisation. Of prime importance is that the customer is informed in a timely
manner and at the correct touch point. This communication should be by voice or direct SMS.

POA Operations Major Incident Procedure

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

The communication should include the date, time, name, nature of the incident, priority, if service
affecting, likely impact, and the Fujitsu owner to contact.

e The Major Incident Manager (Duty Manager OOH, who covers Monday to Friday 17:30 to 09:00
and from 17:00 Friday though to 09:00 Monday) should also initiate communication using SMS
via the MAC team (see operational hours above.). Outside of these hours the SMS should be via
the SMC. The SMS distribution list used is titled ‘SMS Internal’ and amongst others includes the
appropriate members of the POA Operations Management Team.

3 Post Office Account defining a Major Incident

3.1. Incident Classification

As a general rule a Major Incident will be an incident rated as a Business Critical Incident as shown in the
following

- The ‘CONTRACT’
- Sections 3.2 and 3.3 below.
- POA Operations Incident Management Procedure document (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018).

- Aseries of connected lower priority incidents which combine to have a significant business
impact.

However not all incidents rated as priority 1 qualify as a Major Incident as the priority levels do not always
reflect the overall business impact to POL. For example a single counter post office which is unable to
trade, regardless of its business volumes, is rated as a priority 1 incident.

For incident classification on Post Office Account refer to the POA Incident Enquiry Matrix
SVM/SDM/SD/0023.

3.2. Influencing Factors in calling a Major Incident

It is important that a Major Incident is defined in accordance with section 3.3 Major Incident Triggers, as
such, because of its business impact on the day when it occurs, rather than simply being defined as a
Major Incident because it appears on a list. However the following parameters will also feed into the
consideration of whether a major incident should be called:

e Duration, i.e. how long has the vulnerability to service already existed?

e Impact across the estate, including consideration of whether a service is merely degraded or
actually stopped

e Time at which the event occurs in relation to the 24 hour business day
e Time of year — e.g. Christmas / Easter / End of month / quarter

« Anticipated time before service can be resumed

e Impact to POL branches, customers, clients or brand image

e Business initiatives e.g. product launches

3.3 Major Incident Triggers

The following criteria could trigger a major incident, however as detailed in 3.2, the influencing factors
must also be considered. As such the list below is not exhaustive, whilst if an incident occurs which is
not detailed below, e.g., legislative, it should not necessarily be precluded from being declared a major
incident.

e Business stopped for any Fujitsu controlled reason, e.g. infrastructure failure/outage that would
render Post Office unable to process POLSAP business transactions.

e Outage of key Fujitsu infrastructure which affects the POLSAP services.

During business hours the Major Incident Manager declares and manages the Major Incident (with
handovers to the POA OOH Duty Manager where applicable.)

Where the impact of the incident is not immediately obvious, and it is not clear if a Major Incident should
be called, escalation and discussion with the POA Operations Management Team should occur, and a

collective decision made. If a Major Incident is not called, the incident should be monitored until closure,
to ensure that the impact does not increase to that of a Major Incident.

In the event that multiple services are impacted, multiple Major Incident Managers may be appointed by
any Service Lead or Senior SDM and will remain in their roles until incident closure.

Out of hours the POA OOH Duty Manager is responsible for declaring a Major Incident.

Section 8 of this document specifies the roles and responsibilities during a major incident. The Major
Incident Manager, see section 8.2, is referred to the Manage Major Incident Procedure and must
endeavour throughout the life of a major incident to adhere to the principles of that procedure.

When initiating the Major Incident Report, as required by the Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management
Systems Major Incident Procedure, take into consideration the Post Office specific reporting requirements
detailed in the Post Office Major Incident Report Requirements contained in section 6.5 below.

6 Communications

6.1 Technical Bridge

This is a Fujitsu technical conference for Technical experts and SDU's to discuss and analyse the
incident and to formulate an action plan to restore the service to POL without delay. It should enable the
Technical Recovery Manager to baseline the anticipated response, covering resolution, time and
resources required. This will also include the appropriate owning SDU of the service affected by the
Major Incident.

The Technical Bridge will be set up as required by the Major Incident Manager.

Invitations to the Technical Bridge will be via SMS, email, various Skype functions or voice. The SMS will
be sent to the distribution list titled ‘Technical Bridge’. The SMS text or Skype meeting request will be
sent to technical experts on the POA account and will include outline details of the Major Incident. Also
dial in details and the start time will be provided as part of the meeting invitation.

The Technical Bridge will be started at T + 15, and reconvened at regular intervals during the Major
Incident; the exact scheduling will be discussed and agreed at each preceding Major Incident Call.

The Technical Bridge is chaired by the Major Incident Manager with the recovery managed by the
Technical Recovery Manager.

A request for a Technical Recovery Manager (TRM) will be made to the appropriate Service Delivery Unit
or Development Leads, who will appoint one of his team to be the TRM.

Following each Technical Bridge, it is the responsibility of the TRM to agree any actions as follows
-Recovery / restoration actions (which should normally include the TfSNow Change numbers),
-Service Improvement Plan recommendations
-Risk Register recommendations
-Recommendations for any improvements to KELS / Alerting / Configuration changes

The above will be documented in the Major Incident Report which is produced using the MIR Report
template contained within the Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management Systems Major Incident Procedure

6.2 Service Bridge

This is a service focussed call for Service Management (including the Technical Recovery Manager if
appropriate) and POL to discuss the service impact of the Major Incident and to receive updates on the
progress towards resolution. Atos Service Management may also be the initiators of a Service Bridge.

6.6 Escalation Communication Protocol

The primary principle:

“Up and Across”

Example:

The Major Incident Manager would escalate up to POA Lead SDM, Problem and Major Incident
Management, and across to the Atos Service Desk.

7 Formal Incident Closure & Post Incident Review

7.1 Post Incident Review

The Post Incident Review is chaired by the Major Incident Manager and follows a set agenda which is
distributed with the Post Incident Review meeting invitation, along with the draft copy of the Major
Incident Report (if available).

The template for writing a Post Incident Review Report is stored in Dimension (hyperlink below) under
SVM/SDM/TEM/2531.

http://europevuk459.europe fs.fujitsu.com/ccmweb/ProjectHome1 .aspx

The purpose of a Post Incident Review is:

* To understand the incident that prevented a Service or Services from being delivered.

* To confirm the impact to the business during and after the Incident and agree the number of
branches impacted and duration of Major Incident.

* To confirm the end-to-end recovery process and timeline, and identify that all documented
processes were followed.

* To analyse the management of the incident and the effectiveness of the governance process.
* To identify corrective actions, including agreed Third Party actions, to:
© prevent recurrence of the incident

co minimise future business impact
o improve the procedure for the management of incidents

Output: To confirm details provided in the draft MIR provided to Atos, update with corrective actions and
redistribute. To also include any of the following as appropriate

- any activities for a Service Improvement Plan
- any Changes and associated TfSNow Change reference.

- any follow up that requires to be progressed via Problem Management

POA Operations Major Incident Procedure

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

- any improvements to KELS, alerting and /or event management

The agreed impact of the Major Incident must be provided for inclusion in the Counter Availability SLT
Figures.

If this review highlights areas where improvements can be made, an agreed Service Improvement Plan
will be produced, using the EMEIA SIP template, with appropriate actions, owners and timescales. It will
also identify any ongoing risks to the service, together with any changes. Service Management will track
all actions to resolution. Third party actions will be reviewed at Service Review meetings.

Consideration should be given as to whether the improvements can be shared across Fujitsu as lessons
learnt, in accordance with Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management System document: Major Incident
Procedure (28/07/2016). These are to be documented on the Lessons Learnt portal to help other
Accounts to learn from the failures or success of the major incident activities. As stipulated in the
document, there may be situations when the lessons cannot be shared due to confidentiality reasons.

Itis important that the number of branches impacted and the duration of the Major Incident is agreed at
the Major Incident Review. This information is required to calculate the impact on Branch and Counter
Availability and any associated Liquidated Damages (LD) liabilities

7.2 The Major Incident Report

A first draft of the Major Incident Report is to be produced within 24 hours and on the approval of the
POA Senior Service Delivery Manager sent to ATOS Service Management.

The first formal version of the Major Incident Report is to be produced within five working days and on the
approval of the POA Senior Service Delivery Manager is sent to ATOS Service Management. Generally
this report will be produced after a Post Incident Review is held and the actions for the Major Incident
Report identified.

If applicable a Problem Record is to be opened for tracking the corrective actions and managed through
the POA Problem Management Process. The formal Major Incident Report version 1.0 is to be attached
to the TfSNow problem record and sent formally for storing in Dimension.

One or more formal versions of the Major Incident Report is to be produced which will also be sent to
either ATOS Service or Problem Management, after the approval of the POA Senior Service Delivery
Manager, providing feedback on the corrective actions. These major incident reports are also to be
attached to the TfSNow problem record and sent formally for storing within Dimension

Please use the link below for the EMEIA Standard Major Incident Report
https://emeia fujitsu.local/emeia/c/P0004/Process_Maps/Major_Incident_Management_Process.pdf

You may need to amend the report template, so it covers the specific requirements of the customer i.e.
timeline.

7.3 Calculating potential LD liability for Major Incidents

Major Incidents which qualify as Failure Events are detailed in the Branch Network Service Description
(SVM/SDM/SD/0011). A Failure Event is defined in this document as an event or series of connected
events which causes one or more Counter Positions to be deemed to be Unavailable due to a Network
Wide Failure or a Local Failure. Ongoing failures will be deemed to be part of such a Failure Event until
the Failure Event is closed in accordance with the Incident closure and Major Incident Review process as
detailed in section 6.0.

For a Failure Event the Incident Closure & Major Incident Review Process will require Atos and Fujitsu to
agree the number of branches and counter positions affected and the duration of the outage (rounded to
the nearest 30 minutes as detailed in the Network Wide Rounding Table).

Network Wide Rounding Table

30 minutes or less 30 minutes

Manager acts as the central point for communication and non-technical information flow, allowing the
TRM to focus on the technical situation and the resolution of the Incident. The Major Incident Manager is.
also responsible for creating and maintaining all the associated documentation. For the process to be
effective, all updates and information regarding the incident must be fed to the MIM to update the
timelines and report.

The Major Incident Manager:
e Calls and chairs the Technical Bridge

e Has responsibility for creating the Major Incident Report, using the template defined in section9.1
and ensuring that the applicable information is captured.

e Records the Technical Bridge attendees names so they can be documented in the Major Incident
