both) for the purposes of, maintenance, support, upgrade, repair or replacement of any
equipment used to provide support for those Links

(NB. Scheduled maintenance to any component of the Data Centres, which provide on-line
service, will not be allowed during Network Banking core hours (0800 to 1730 Monday to
Friday (inclusive) and 0800 to 1300 Saturday, excluding English Bank holidays). The time for

Office Change Management will be asked to communicate to the impacted FI and within
Post Office Ltd and to approve the OCP.

working days notice, however a minimum notice period of 24 hours for controlled close
down will be given.

4.0 Emergency Close Down (Causes/Problems)

Emergency — Close down of the NBX link from both Data Centres (Bootle & Wigan) should
the service be under a threat that would put the POL services or service infrastructure for End
to End Banking at risk of being materially impaired or degraded.

Circumstances that would trigger such a close down can be summarised as follows:
e A threat to the Security of the POL Services or POL Service Infrastructure
¢ Data originating from any FI on the NBX could cause impairment or degradation.

e Data originating from the POL Service Infrastructure could cause impairment or
degradation.

e Banking transactions could be incorrectly authorised, due to actual or suspected failure in
End to End Banking

4.1 Notification Procedure (Emergency)

e The POA On-line Services SDM is alerted (via the normal route of HSD/SMC) to an “A”
priority call giving evidence of the problem - Primarily, the “A” priority call will have been
raised by the Post Office Account support teams, or by an FI logging call at the SMC. The
POA On-line SDM will consult as appropriate within Post Office Account Services to
make the decision to call Major Incident.

e PO On-line SDM informs the POABCM (Post Office Account Business Continuity
Manager) who in turn contacts the POLBCM (Post Office Business Continuity Manager)
to register a MBCTI. This is in accordance with the agreed procedure for an MBCI [DN:
“Business Continuity Interface Agreement between Post Office Ltd and Post Office
Account Services (CON/MGM/005)"].

e The Major Incident Process (POA Major Incident Process, CS/PRD/074) will be initiated,
and Major Incident Conference Call held to discuss the close down the link / links. The
Major Incident Conference Call will include impacted parties, including representatives
from Post Office Ltd.

© Following agreement on the MI Conference Call, the Network Support team will close
down the impacted NBX link/s.

e Via the Major Incident process (MI Conference Call), all impacted parties informed that
the links have been closed down.

¢ Major Incident Process continues until the links are restored.

5.0 Technical Close Down Procedure

The technical closing down of the Link or Links will be controlled and actioned by the
POANST (Post Office Account Network Support Team) based in both Bootle and Wigan.

Wigan Outside Firewalls Names Bootle Outside Firewall Names
wegn01-fw-26 btl01-fw-26

wgn01-fw-27 btlO1-fw-27

Financial Institution Port assignments common on all Outside Firewalls
LiNK e2

Alliance and Leicester 3

CAPO e4

DMZ el

Controlled and Emergency Close Down: For the controlled close down of one or more of
the links to the Financial institutions, shut down the relevant firewall port across all Wigan and
Bootle Outside firewalls, refer to table 1 for names and port assignments.

For example to close down access to and from Link, close port e2 on btl01-fw-26/27 and
wgn01-fw-26/27.

If Financial Institution have cause to be isolated due to a threat or otherwise, and the internal
port into the DMZ on all outside firewalls is shut down, management of the firewalls will still
be possible, as this is performed “out of band” for these firewalls. Therefore, although no
application traffic flow will be possible, management of firewalls to re-enable the DMZ
interface will be possible.

The topology deployed for NBX is depicted in figure 1, See Figure 1.

diagnostic or communications management functions.
