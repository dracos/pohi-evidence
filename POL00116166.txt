Thanks Paula, sounds like you had a good call with Ron. (The applications sound like grim but
useful reading - I'll take a look tomorrow).

On our earlier conversation about getting the formal appointment letter sent out to Tony Hooper -
I discussed this with Rod and he suggested that it would probably be more appropriate for this to
come from the instructing solicitors (i.e. Bond Dickinson) - but we agreed that it would still be a
nice touch for you to send a more informal note saying how pleased you are he's taking up the
role. I'll let you know when the letter has been sent.

Rod will also pull together the file note on TH endorsements.

Hope the trip to Swansea goes well, I'm sure the team will really appreciate you making the
effort.

Dear Ron,
it was good to talk to you earlier. Thank you for being available.

IT have just read through the attachments. Apart from finding them very disturbing (I
defy anyone not to), I am now even better better informed. The form you have
devised is very helpful as it removes some of the emotion and highlights very clearly
areas we need to address as well as investigate for the mediation process, which I
hope will bring closure for some of these people.

I'm really looking forward to seeing Angela and her team tomorrow.
As I said when we spoke, I take this very seriously as I hope my trip to Swansea

demonstrates. Angela is doing a seriously good job, and I know you think so too.
Both of you have my full support and you must not hesitate to get in touch if needed.
Kind regards,
Paula

Paula:

As promised in today's call, here are eight examples of the
incoming Applications. I've selected those that are more
clearly expressed than most of the others that we've been
receiving. I'd have also sent Case M041 but it hasn't been
scanned yet.

I'm also enclosing a spreadsheet that shows which ‘Thematic
Issues' each Applicant has reported to us. It's probably not
worth you looking at that before your meeting with Angela
and her team tomorrow but, in case you do, you only need to
look at Rows 55 to 97 (those are the Mediation Applications).
The rows above that relate to the MP-sourced cases and
those that came in from the JFSA. In some cases the
Mediation Applicants were already on the spreadsheet so are
cross-referenced to their earlier appearance. Where there
are more ‘Thematic Issues’ marked on an MP-sourced case
than on that same case's Mediation Application that's
because we know more about the case than has as yet been
revealed in the Mediation Application.
