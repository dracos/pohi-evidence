Post Office Ltd Incident & Major Incident Framework @

1. Purpose

The purpose of this framework document is to explain how Post Office limited manages incidents within
its domain and control, how its suppliers and clients operate Incident Management at a high level and
their interactions with Post Office at a generic incident level.

Incident Management evoles during the incident lifecycle and this process document is a guide to support
the process, rather than set immovable steps. The incident lead will decide whether the process steps are
fit for purpose during any incident they own, should a new process step be used or a step deemed to be
defunct, it will be reviewed during any Post Incident Review or washup and this document will be
updated.

This document is a generic process document, Post Office will use individual process guides that will be
recorded upon a call logging tool to manage specific incidents, where no individual process map has been
developed the incident management team will fall back to using this document as a reference and guide.

The purpose of this document is to explain:
roles and responsibilities in managing an incident and the methods by which management will be
notified that a] an incident has occurred and b] that their involvement will be required
© the types of incidents likely to result in the invocation of Major Incident Management procedure
e the procedures that will be used by Post Office Ltd [POL] should a major incident occur.

2. Policy Statement

The goal of Incident Management is to provide the highest possible level of service availability through
minimization of the impact of Incidents by:-
Having controls and processes in place.
Ensuring all incidents are managed and logged within a single repository.
Ensuring all incidents follow the same format.
Delivering timely and effective communications.
Delivering resolution timeframes acceptable to the business.
Ensuring customer satisfaction maintained at all times.

The Post Office Ltd Incident Management process is owned and managed by the Live Service Continuity Team
within Service Management.

Incidents can be managed directly by suppliers or clients if there is no significant impact to the Post Office critical
service, financial arrangements, brand or reputation of Post Office Itd.

All service impacting incidents are managed using a three level management structure within Post Office Ltd. The
involvement of each level is influenced by the severity of the incident.

Incident Management activities must be based on the established process and set of procedures which are
referenced within

3. Incident Response

An evaluation of the extent and scope of the incident will be conducted by the Post Ofifce Service Desk, initially,
with key business stakeholders to confirm if required, in order to help formulate an appropriate response plan.
(Evaluations/updates can take place periodically, i.e. daily as incidents and the management of them evolve).

Post Office Ltd Incident & Major Incident Framework @

The answers to the following will help in that assessment (this list is not exhaustive and needs to be formulated
for each type or incident):

Which systems are involved and to what extent? (How does this impact customer or business activities?)
How critical is each involved system?

What time of day/month/year etc.

Who are the customers of that service?

Should we invoke the InfoSecurity Incident Management Process?

Is there an ongoing threat?

Is there a need to invoke Business Continuity or Disaster Recovery to maintain or restore business services?
Are more monitoring and logging needed for the investigation?

Is it known if the incident has been perpetrated internally or externally of the business?

Does the business require additional resources, and/or external assistance (i.e. forensic investigators

Is the incident to be reported to the Police, Information Commissioner or Acquirer?

Is it likely the company will want to prosecute or take formal action against any perpetrator?

Any other information that will assist the decision making process.

Incident logging process is completed by Service Now which can be reached on the following URL:
[ HYPERLINK "https://postofficeprod.service-now.com/" ]

Instructions on how to use Service Now can be found in the Incident Logging Process document.
Should Service Now be unavailable a manual incident logging form can be found in Appendix 12 F

4. Incident Priority

Incident Priority is a simple code assigned to incidents, problems and known errors, indicating the seriousness of
their effect on the availability or Quality of Service. It is the means of assigning Severity for incident resolution.

The initial decision on an incident’s severity rests with the Post Office Service Desk where incidents are normally
first reported.

However anyone from within Post Office Ltd can call the Post Office Service Desk following and request that the
BPT are engaged.

47. Major Incident Definition

‘An incident that has an immediate and/or potentially prolonged adverse impact on one, some or all of the
following: PO Ltd Branches, POL employees, customers, clients or PO Ltd brand image’.

It is difficult to precisely define a Major Incident due to the number of variables that have to be considered as part
of the impact assessment when an incident occurs. Such factors include time of day, business climate, day of

week and time of year.

Major IT suppliers to PO Ltd — Fujitsu Services, HPES and CSC - are currently re-defining major incident trigger
points. These will be included in future versions of this document to further assist in Major Incident definition.

A Major Incident is an incident that has occurred with a significant and potentially prolonged adverse impact on
PO Ltd. The impact will be be significant to the Post Office Brand and Reputation. Typically these incidents will
initially require a significant amount of reactive management before they can then be controlled and resolved.

To provide further guidance, a number of example scenarios together with the resulting business impact are now
defined. The level of management input is also clarified.

Update policies and procedures as appropriate

Any staff training and awareness necessary to support future incident prevention or management.

These will appear in your message in box as being from ‘DutyManager’.

Be the single contact point and co-ordinate all activities within your directorate/function.

Be responsible for making decisions on behalf of the business, and taking actions to quickly manage
the adverse impacts of a major service incident.

group- ensuring that where the incident impacts your directorate/function you have kept all
interested parties within your directorate informed and continue to keep them informed on the
progress of the incident through to resolution.

Ensure that members of the Live Service Continuity Team are informed/notified about any events in
your area, which may lead to a major service incident.

Consider any communications that may be required following the post major incident review, and be
instrumental in their Management, if appropriate to your directorate/function . For example, giving

MBS 213 - Horizon report

The Post Office has today announced the introduction of an independent mediation scheme to address the concerns raised by some subpostmasters regarding
cases which they feel require further resolution.

This follows the publication of the interim report into the Horizon system produced by Second Sight in July.

The report stated that so far no evidence of system wide problems with the Horizon software had been found. However, it noted that improvements could be
made in the training and support processes provided to subpostmasters.

In response to the report the Post Office has made a number of commitments, one of which is to create this independent mediation scheme for subpostmasters
and the Post Office to investigate and try to resolve subpostmasters concerns.

The Post Office statement will be available on Subspaceonline and [ HYPERLINK "http://www.postoffice.co.uk/news-releases-2013" ] this
