Subject: RE: heads up PMQs

Tom Wechsler!

As to the report, I am not persuaded we should — they are not entitled to it and, while it may play well on a transparency
point, the downstream consequences for endless correspondence about the report’s detail and the decision we’ve taken
to be robust I think outweighs what benefit there may be in doing so.

JA said we’d sacked second sight and ordered them to destroy their documents — Belinda is following up on the second
of those but it is certainly not as dramatic as that. On the first, however, I think we can’t get away from the fact that we
did end SS’ contract but to call it a sacking is to wildly overplay what has in fact happened — we have already agreed with
them in principle that we are going to collaborate on both the Pll and the Applicant’s cases and we’re meeting on Friday
to agree the detail.

It’s a good PMQ soundbite from JA but, as ever, the reality is a great deal more prosaic.

We will have to answer the question: will you make the part 2 report available to the select committee and I think we
should say yes we will.
