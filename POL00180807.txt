> Further to your e-mail below - I've spoken to BIS to make sure that they are aware of your offer re Norman ringing you if he
wishes on this subject.

> More generally - next week the JFSA are meeting Norman Lamb. This is a potential meeting that was asked for when Norman
came into office (JFSA had met Edward Davey back in Nov 2010 and wanted to see the new Minister). BIS replied saying it was
possible - nothing further happened - until a few days ago when a meeting got scheduled for next Wednesday 27 June. JFSA
attendees would be Alan Bates and Issy Hogg - a lawyer.

>

> BIS will be briefing Norman in advance of that meeting and we are providing some background to them. The BIS line on this
issue when Davey met JFSA was to listen to what was said but not get caught into detailed debate. I'd expect the same approach this
time.

>

> On this occasion there is likely to be reference to the reviews following the publicity around the Arbuthnot meeting. BIS would
regard this as an operational matter for POL and would not get involved but, by definition, that would involve effectively referring
JFSA to POL for answers to their questions. My suggestion is that any such reference should be through to my team (in terms of
external affairs/comms ) rather than Kevin or yourself which might take us into more complex areas about whether the JFSA were
being seen as some kind of 'representative body’.

>

> The other relevant aspect to this is that you will of course see Norman at the Alexander / Maude meetings earlier on that
Wednesday - so I will update you further early next week about our liaison with BIS - so that you are informed should the matter
come up when you have contact with Norman earlier in that day

fine.
