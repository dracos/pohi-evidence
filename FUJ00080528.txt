MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During this Assessment of Royal Mail Group Account 5 Non-conformities and 2 Observations were raised
against the PSD. No Non-conformities or Observations were raised against the relevant Core Division
Capability Units.

In s§mthary, the main findings and recommendations, as appropriate, were as follows:

This assessment has been conducted to ensure that the ISMS is sufficiently developed to undertake an
ISO 27001 assessment from an external body.

Significant progress has been made in developing the risk approach and assessment. The ISMS
manual is generally compliant with the requirements of the international standard. There are a few
areas where it would be beneficial to improve the content.

The supporting systems are deployed. Controls were sampled but the level of contro! sampling is only
an indicator as the sample activity was restricted to limited review.

The issues raised at this assessment against ISO27001 need to be addressed prior to the assessment
and those raised against ISO9001 need to have a plan in place to address the issues. There are some
general improvement comments and it would be beneficial if these were to be reviewed and plans put in
place where appropriate.

The outcome of this report indicates that the account is ready for its 15027001 part 1
assessment.

PSD

e The ISMS Manual - defines the security system and provides the scope, objectives, risk
methodology and general guidance to the security approach. The documentation structure is not well
defined and navigation of the system would be improved by a suitable map or diagram.

Please see Observation Ref 1 in section 5 and section 4.1 for further details.

« Risk Management — The risk methodology has been defined within the ISMS manual. A security
tisk assessment has been conducted using the STREAM toolset. Controls have been selected and a
Statement of Applicability (SOA) produced within the toolset showing the application of those
controls. The SOA does not meet the version contro! and documentation requirements of the
International Standard.

Please see Non-conformance Ref 2 in section 5 and section 4.2 for further details.

« Documentation Requirements - Documents & records are generally available and version
controlled in Dimensions. Documentation is controlled in accordance with Q&BE/08. Please section
4.3 for further details.

« Key ISMS processes & activities —- processes have been defined. There is a need to ensure that
management review activities are fully covered. Training and education is in place, internal audits
are planned but records are inconsistent, corrective actions are still to be reviewed and closed from
previous years assessments., Measures of effectiveness are not aligned to the security objectives.
Please see Non-conformities Ref 3, Ref 4 and Observation Ref 5 in section 5 and section 4.4 for
further details.

e¢ BMS & Quality management (ISO 9001) - a number of BMS requirements were noted as
incomplete or not in place. This included integrated audit schedule, process lets and the update of
the Implementation Approach Document (IAD).

Please see Non-conformance Ref 6 in section 5 and section 4.5 for further details.

« Sampled Security Controls - a walkthrough of selected processes was conducted. Minimal
evidence was reviewed. This was approached in this manner to minimise the operational impact on
staff. Processes were noted to be generally in place. The Incident management process was not
linking to the Corporate Incident management system which is a requirement of the Security Policy

(CPM20)

Please see Non-conformance Ref 7 in section 5 and section 4.6 for further details.

4. ASSESSMENT COMMENTARY

4.1 The ISMS Manual
Assessment Criteria: Establish the ISMS, Implement & operate the ISMS, Monitor and review the ISMS.
ISA2%01 sections 4.2.1, 4.22, 4.2.3.
e¢ The ISMS manual has already been reviewed at a pre-assessment by BSI.

o The ISMS manual provides the linkage to the Corporate Policies and Fujitsu
UK&l Security Manual.

o The ISMS manual is SVM/SEC/MAN/0003 is at version 1.6

co ISMS objectives include:- Management commitment, risk, improvement, Legal &
regulatory and education.

o An operational improvement plan in place
Observation Ref 1. Improvement in the navigating the system could be achieved and it is
recommended that the following be considered:-

o Adda documentation map or diagram

o Improve linkage to the CCD documents and local procedures.

o Boundaries & Interface diagram be added to the manual

o Objectives, Measures & targets are expressed in sections 3 -3.2 of the ISMS
manual.

o Measurement & effectiveness is in section 3.2 and the measures do not all
relate to the objectives and measures in section 3.1.

o Consideration needs to be given to SMART measures.

e The high level security organisation, roles and responsibilities are defined in the ISMS
manual.

o The security responsibilities for core roles is currently not defined at community
level within the generic Job descriptions etc. This is being followed up outside
this assessment. (It is suggested that RMGA may wish to review and discuss
this with HR).

e ISMS Scope has been defined.

o Exclusions to scope are clearly defined.

¢ Discussion is required as to whether or not interface agreements are required for Core and
HR functions as they are represented and managed by the account.

e The version of SOA should be removed from the scope statement for ease of maintenance
and perhaps replaced with a hotlink to the latest SOA.
4.2 Risk Management, Control selection and SOA

Assessment Criteria: Define Risk Approach, Identify
conto vor the treatment of risk, manage residual risks.

;, Analyse and evaluate risks, sect control objective and

ISO 27001 sections:4.2.1 (d-g)

¢ A local Manage Risk process is operated. It is stated that this has been mapped to the
local Manage Risk process and that the risk process owner has been consulted in the
development of the process.

‘There is no let for this alternative process.(T APP

4.1 above for details ASKED BILL
¢ Arisk tool (STREAM) has been adopted for the purpose at creating and maintaining the

risk assessment. This was adopted following the customers dissatisfaction with the
preferred Risk Pro approach.

¢ Risk steps are not necessarily addressed in the conventional order but there is clear
evidence that the risk assessment approach ensures that: -

o Assets have been categorised and owned,
o threats & vulnerabilities identified,
o Confidentiality, Integrity and availability incorporated.

« The above has been evaluated as a score and controls selected based on the risk score
rating, which was against, a predetermined scoring scheme. Residual risks are retained
and risks have been treated by the selection and application of appropriate controls.

e The ISO 27001 controls have been supplemented by additional controls to meet the
contractual and regulatory requirements. An SOA (statement of applicability) records the
applied controls.

This could represent an obstacle to understanding the decisions taken in the early stages
of the risk assessment. This being said the method is repeatable and vulnerabilities for
each category are well defined.

« The SOA (Statement of Applicability) is not version controlled and is a dynamic document
produced by the toolset. The controls include more than the references to the standard
and it is difficult to navigate. After discussion with the registrar it is agreed that the SOA
should be produced as a direct mapping to the Appendix A controls of the standard. The
SOA needs to be version controlled and directly traceable to any issued certificate or
assessment report. PLACED INA DOCUMENT AND ilS VERSION CONTROLLED
Additionally it is a requirement that exceptions are documented wit reason for their non-
selection. (ALU CONTROL GROUPS SEEM PERTINENT AT THIS TIME) Please see Non-
conformance Ref 2.

e Measurement is in place that demonstrates the trend in the risk measures. These are
tracked with the objective of reducing risk.

4; Documentation requirements
Assessment Criteria: Documentation Control & Records, O&BE/08.
ISO 27001 sections 4.3.

¢ Documents & Records are generally available and version controlled in Dimensions.
Documentation is controlled in accordance with Q&BE/08.

¢ Delays in versions updates can occur due to the bottleneck of the document controller.

« Some quality records such as monthly security review are not yet held on a network

repository. (Don’t understand this, the monthly security report is held on Dimensions)

e Audit plans and records are not consistently recorded — please see section 4.4 below for
details.

e Records & Repositories need to be retained on a FS UK&l corporate drive. There were a
few examples of meeting notes that had been retained on laptops. These me 5
are ie our curity web. ‘Gif€ This was resolved at the assessment however
awareness of this needs to be flowed down the team.

4.4 Key ISMS processes & activities
Assessment Criteria: Assess & review the BMS, process management, Manage the BMS.,
ISO 9001 sections5- 8,
Management Review & Responsibility

« Management Review is partly addressed in the quarterly system reviews (ISMR). It is
suggested that the input requirements of the standard are checked to the agenda to
ensure that all aspects are covered. It may also be appropriate to summarise the proposed
security measures as an input. See measures of Effectiveness below:

Measures of Effectiveness

e It is a requirement of the international standard that measures of effectiveness of the
system controls are made (4.2.2 (d)).

¢ The measures defined in the ISMS manual in respect of the system (see also section 4.1
above for details) are not fully aligned to the objectives and targets. Now align: 1
measures jpgraded There is a need to understand what control measures will
demonstrate effectiveness. Then to develop an appropriate reporting mechanism such as
a scorecard... SG6reeard Wil! BeWEVEISPEd Please see Non-Conformance Ref 3.

Training Awareness, Education and Competence

¢ The corporate CBT used for security awareness training has been mandated on the
account and current completion rate stands at 87%

« ARMGA communications strategy is in place and this includes:

o Regular cascades of security information.
o CafeVik articles
o Communication is provided by the PMO (Programme office) function.

. tt was stated that security competence is recorded within Performance plus and that
récords of training are available.

e Key security roles have defined competences.

Internal Audits

« The RMGA account including the Core services aspect is some 300 people. The key site
for the operation of the service is Bracknell. Internal security audits have been conducted
throughout the development of the ISMS, however, records are held in various locations
and plans are not consistent. This means that coverage and recoverability of records is
impacted.

o A local internal audit strategy plan exists.

o Alocal internal audit plan for 2010-11 has been produced.

o One audit has been completed this year

o By the time of the assessment only 3 will have been completed.

o Last years audit records (2009-10) are not controlled by a formal plan and to
demonstrate coverage suitable for an assessment this will need to be
addressed. Please see Non-Conformance Ref 4.

o Internal Security Audits are not shown on the RMG account integrated
assessment plan. Please see section 4.5 below.

Corrective and Preventive Actions

e Corrective Actions from previous internal assessments are outstanding. It is essential that
this is resolved prior to an external assessment. Please see Observation Ref 5.

o There are 48 aged issues and the new quality manager has currently evidenced
closure of 14.

o The Quality Manager has a plan in place to review and close theses issues.

e¢ “Opportunity for Improvement” - The location of the records of defects and the actions
taken to resolve them is inconsistent and it has been agreed that all will now be recorded
into the assessment Db.

4.5 BMS & Quality Management
Assessment Criteria: Assess & review the BMS, process management, Manage the BMS.,

ISO 9001 sections 4,

¢ As part of the interview process for the readiness to ISO 27001 it was noted that a number
BMS management issues arose. Although these are not show stoppers in respect of ISO
27001 there needs to be action taken to ensure future compliance with the BMS. These
are raised collectively under one Non-Conformance against the Quality Policy rather than

Integrated audit schedule is in place but for year 2009-10. It does not contain information
about Security Audits conducted in that period.

¢ Most of the internal audit reports and internal security audit reports are recorded in the
assessment database. However, 2010 audits have not been recorded in the assessment
4fatabase and findings are therefore not consistently located.

e Process lets were not readily available for the sampled processes at this assessment. It is
thought that some exist but due to staff changes the traceability seems to have been lost.
It has been suggested that in future lets or equivalent evidence are hot linked to the IAD.

e¢ The Implementation approach document (IAD) is in place however it is considered that it
may be out of date and due review.

4.6 Sampled Controls & associated processes
Assessment Criteria: Sampled controls see below for details

ISO 27001 sections AS — AI5

Change Management

e All New Services and changes are introduced via Change Control. This has recently
transferred to the MSC toolset.

o Criteria has been set to involve Security in CAB and risk assessment where
appropriate (typically Sophos firewalls etc..).

o Mechanisms to include change impacts into Security risk assessment are in
place but still need to be documented in the ISMS risk method.

o Although at this time no change has impacted the overall security risk register it
should be remembered that this can occur and that a significant change could
increase or decrease the applied controls.

Security Incident Management

e A local process supports this activity and a register of incidents is retained. All incidents
are discussed and acted upon in conjunction with the customer. Security meetings are
formally in place. Incidents and trends are discussed with senior management of the
account at the interim (currently 2 weekly) and quarterly reviews.

o It is unclear if the local Security Incident management process has been
approved by the process owner / champion and a let granted.

o Security Incidents are not reported outside the account. It is a requirement of
the Security Policy that all incidents (possibly anonymous) be recorded into the
corporate incident management system. This allows the SMF to analyse issues
occurring within Fujitsu UK & I so that they can further advise the SMB as to
whether or not additional controls may be necessary. Please see Non-
Conformance Ref 7.

Third Party Management

e Although the account has numerous suppliers only one is deemed to impact the security
system. This supplier is based in India (Infinite). The supplier is ISO 27001 registered and

is also subject to supplier audit by the RMG account security team. The supplier audit
process is laid out in SVM/SEC/PRO/0036.

o Audits of the supplier have been conducted.
© Security requirements are expressed in the contract.

1.1

o Ascoring mechanism is in place against the International Standard (ISO 27001)
clauses.

o Longer term it may be possible to reduce the frequency of visits based on the
performance achieved.

Risk in S/W Design & Development

« The processes operated for the software design & development are based on the Waterfall
model. The processes are unique to the RMG account. It is thought that the ADBM
process owner was consulted during the process development. Security issues are
considered in the overall architectural approach and security risks and requirements are
reviewed and accepted during design approval.

o The process design let was not available. A collective issue is raised in section
4.5 above.

© Code review is conducted at an independent level as is system testing.

o There is an “Opportunity for Improvement” to add a single sheet to the
development overview showing the interactions of security with the software
development method.

Business Continuity Management

e Business Continuity plans exist for the account activities and are covered by 3 separate
document:- HnGx Services, Support and Engineering Services. All plans have been
approved and up to date.

o Test plans are scheduled annually and all tests have currently been achieved.
o Results of tests are reviewed with the customer.
o Activities are reported in the Service report

o There would appear to be an “Opportunity for Improvement” to ensure that
any threats in this area flow through to all impacted activities.

Secure Areas (Physical Security and Access Control)

e A walk round was conducted of the secure rooms on Floor 4. Access is controlled by key
card and the rooms are also within a secure area. The rooms deal with confidential
transaction and fraud activities and can involve copying data to CD’s to support customer
investigations. Access is limited to around 10 people. At the time of the visit there was
activity in progress.

o The activity is being condensed to one room and the removal of obsolete kit,
Dat tapes and storage of some test items will discontinue.

o All machines in use were found to be locked down and password protected.

o All data extractions are encrypted and delivered by courier.

Non-conformance

e Integrated audit schedule is in place but for year 2009-10. It does not contain information
about Security Audits conducted in that period.

¢ An amount of internal audit reports and internal security audit reports are recorded in the
assessment database. However, 2010 audits have not been recorded in the assessment
database and findings are therefore not consistently located.

« Process lets were not readily available for the sampled processes at this assessment. It
is thought that some exist but due to staff changes the traceability seems to have been
lost. It has been suggested that in future lets or equivalent evidence are hot linked to the
IAD.

« The Implementation approach document (IAD) is in place however it is considered that it
may be out of date and due review.

Non-conformance

It is a requirement of the Security Policy that all incidents (possibly anonymous) be recorded into the

corporate incident management system.

This allows the SMF to analyse issues occurring within Fujitsu UK & I so that they can further advise the

SMB as to whether or not additional controls may be necessary.

Notes

Security Incidents are not currently reported outside the account.

Putting process in place to do this...latest, sale of a router on ebay has been copied across
