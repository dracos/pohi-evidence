Matthew,

We have sent the two KELs for Callendar Square to our IT experts. They have come back with the following
questions for you relating to KELs being deleted when the corresponding issues are fixed:

1. Is that procedure a general rule?

[Matthew Lenton] Yes.
2. If so, is it enshrined in a formal process?

[Matthew Lenton] Yes, please see next point.
3. If so, which - and do we have the corresponding documentation?

[Matthew Lenton] Please see “SVM/SDM/PRO/0875 End to End Application Support Strategy” section 11.2.5 “KEL
deletion”. The final part of that section detailing how it is decided that a KEL should be deleted, is partially
superseded by “SVM/SDM/STP/3289 Terms of Reference for POA KEL Approval Forum” which includes in its remit,
section 1.1: “That issue, time or service expired KEL’s are retired or archived (deactivated).”
4. Are all deleted KELs available in a searchable archive? I assume that text could, in principle, be retrieved
from other KELs.

[Matthew Lenton] They are not text searchable in their current location, but all deleted KELs can potentially be
retrieved, although this would require additional time and effort to do, after which those retrieved would then be
searchable. It is believed that all deleted KELs are still in the archive table.

If you could let me have your responses urgently that would be great, as we have a call with the IT experts this
morning.

Kind regards,
Lucy

Lucy,
We have looked into this, and it appears that the relevant Peaks are PCO126042 and PC0O126376, attached.

The two related KELs were deleted, due to the fact that the S90 Release was proven to have fixed the issue, and they
so would not be included in the set of KELs which you have.

We have been able to retrieve the text from one them however, as attached, KEL JSimpkins338Q.

Thanks Matthew.

I've had a look at the information and there is reference in Gareth Jenkins witness statement to an email in appendix c
of Charles McLachlan's report. I've gone through the report but cannot see it included — are you able to send me a
copy of all of appendix c? Gareth also refers to a previous witness statement on 8 February 2010 - do you have a
copy of this?

Also, the report itself contains track changes — do you have a final copy?

Kind regards,

Lucy,
The attached email I sent to you in July included the zip file that was originally provided to Second Sight, and which
includes information relating to the Calendar Square case.

I don’t believe there is a related KEL, but ! will check for other information.

Matthew, Pete,

You may recall a while ago that I asked you to provide information on Calendar Square, Falkirk. Apologies if I have
missed your response, however I think this request may still be outstanding. Please could you provide me with any
information you have on this. Could you also confirm whether KELs exist for this bug?

Kind regards,
