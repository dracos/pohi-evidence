David

The meetings PO would like next week are:

Monday — 1 hr con call with Paula Vennells (CEO) and some of the comms people
o This might include Mark Davies (Comms Director) and Portland (PO's external comms agency)
o The call will have two purposes: (1) to prepare Paula for the board — she likes to be in the know before
the board is told anything and (2) so that the comms team can get a sense of the tone we shall be

using at trial.

o Time: not yet set; I'll let you know on Monday

Tuesday: Full board meeting
o We're on at 11:45 which is the first slot of the day and should last no more than 30mins
o This will be at PO's offices.
o Please can you get there at 11:30 for a prompt start at 11:45

o This is nothing more than a high-level pre-trial update. Attached is the current draft agenda / briefing

Thursday / Friday: 1-2 hour con at OEC
© This will be for the core legal team (Rod, Jane, etc)
© This will be focused on the Cs subs and what you intend to say in opening
o PO aren't looking to influence what you say; they just want to understand what you will be saying.

o Please can you let me know when on Thursday / Friday would be best for you?

Thanks
Andy
