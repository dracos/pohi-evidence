                        POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




            FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF ANDREW PAUL DUNKS



I, Andrew Paul Dunks, will say as follows...


INTRODUCTION


1.   Since 2002, I have been employed by Fujitsu Services Limited in the Customer

     Service Post Office Account ("CSPOA") Security Team.


2.   This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the

     "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 4 January 2023.


BACKGROUND


3.   I have been asked to set out a brief professional background and the

     background to my involvement in the Horizon project.


4.   I left school at the age of 16 and went to college to do an Engineering Industry

     Training Board (EITB) training course in electronics. I did not end up getting a

     job in that industry, but during training was introduced to my now wife, whose

     father had a business building residential extensions. I worked for him until he

     retired, and then worked for a company installing acoustic vents.

                                                                                   WITN00300100




5.   In around 1996 a friend working for international Computers Ltd ("ICL") offered

     to get me a job in desktop computer support. I had no prior experience doing

     this sort of work. The job involved providing IT support internally to ICL

     employees. This was not connected to the Post Office and I was not providing

     external support to those outside ICL.


6.   ICL was acquired by the Fujitsu group and in 2002 changed its name to Fujitsu

     Services Limited ("FSL"). At that time, I was in the process of being made

     redundant. A vacancy became available in the CSPOA Security team within

     FSL, and in 2002 I was hired as the Cryptographic Key Manager for the team. I

     reported to the Operational Security Manager, who reported to the Chief

     Information Security Officer or 'CISO'. Throughout my time working on the Post

     Office account, I did not have anybody reporting to me.


7.   When I joined the Post Office account the Horizon project had already been

     rolled out. I was responsible for managing and refreshing the cryptographic

     keys that enabled the thousands of Post Office Horizon counter terminals to

     securely communicate with the Horizon system. Each cryptographic key had to

     be periodically refreshed. This involved using software to create new keys, and

     then pushing the keys out to the counter terminals. It was initially a very

     laborious manual process and took up most of my time. Following the roll out of

     Horizon HNG-X, the process of managing the cryptographic keys became

     much more automated and this was no longer such a significant part of my

     work.


8.   Over time, my role within CSPOA Security had expanded to include other areas

     of IT security such as user management, intrusion prevention and processing



                                   Page 2 of 18

                                                                                          WITNO0300100




      applications for security checks. I was also given tasks not directly related to IT

      security,   such as      performing audit data extractions          and   transaction

      reconciliations. There were around five people in the CSPOA Security Team

      (though this number fluctuated over the years), and we would rotate through

      these different tasks on a regular basis, though some individuals had greater

      responsibility for certain tasks than others.


9.    User management involved maintaining a database of all the FSL employees

      with access to the Horizon system, setting the user permissions appropriate for

      their role, and managing the digital key devices (iKey) that they used to access

      the system.


10. Intrusion     prevention    involved   ensuring   that   anti-virus    software   was

      appropriately updated on the Horizon system.


11,   Processing applications for security checks involved providing administrative

      assistance to facilitate the vetting being carried out on new sub-postmasters

      ("SPMs"). For example, we would check the passport of the SPM and then

      send it to Group Security; if the security check came back as approved, we

      would then print off a pass for the SPM.


12.   Audit data extractions involved responding to audit record queries ("ARQs")

      made by the Post Office for archived data regarding transactions on the

      Horizon system. Each ARQ would specify the relevant post office branch, date

      range, and data type to be extracted. The person doing the extraction would

      logon to one of the dedicated secure audit workstations and enter the

      parameters specified in the ARQ into the audit extraction tool. The system




                                      Page 3 of 18
                                                                                          WITNO0300100
                                                                                      WITNO0300100




      would extract the relevant data and export it to a spreadsheet. We would then

      place this spreadsheet onto a compact disc and send it to the Post Office.


13.   Transaction reconciliation involved dealing with transactions that had got stuck,

      and had not completed. This was a very process driven task, and my role was

      to follow the documented procedure; I did not need to understand the technical

      details about how or why the transactions were getting stuck. However, in

      general terms I understood that there were many potential reasons that a

      transaction could get stuck, for example, because of a power or network

      outage. I understood that each transaction would go through a number of

      different 'states' until it reached the other end and cleared; if the transaction

      had not cleared then it would get stuck in a particular state, for example `state

      4' or 'state 23'.


14.   There were three ways in which the CSPOA Security Team might be requested

      to assist with the transaction reconciliation process: (1) via automated reports;

      (2) by the Post Office finance team; and (3) by the Horizon System

      Helpdesk/Service Desk (the "HSD") or Software Support Centre ("SSC').


15. Reports would be generated each morning showing all the stuck transactions

      and which state they were in. This was the main way through which the team

      became involved in transaction reconciliation. Depending on the state the

      transaction was stuck in there would be a different procedure that we were

      required to follow. This would include reporting the stuck transactions to the

      Post Office through a Business Incident Management Service (`RIMS") report,

      and raising a PEAK (FSL's internal incident management system) for the SSC




                                    Page 4 of 18
                                                                                           WITNO0300100
                                                                                         WITNO0300100




      to investigate. Once the SSC had resolved the issue, we would then update the

      BIMS report and send it to the Post Office.


16. I understood that these transaction reconciliation reports were automatically

      generated and did not rely upon, or arise from, errors reported by users. My

      role was to follow the procedure for raising a PEAK to the SSC to investigate

      the transaction, and to report the stuck transactions and the eventual resolution

      to the Post Office via BIMS.


17.   On occasion, the Post Office finance team would contact us directly, or via the

      HSD, about a transaction reconciliation issue that had been raised to them, for

      example by an SPM. On those occasions my role would be to ensure that we

      had the necessary information about the transaction, to check whether we were

      already aware of it from the automated reports, and, if necessary, to raise a

      PEAK for the SSC to investigate. I would then report back to the Post Office

      finance team to confirm that the transaction was under investigation, and once

      the issue was resolved.


18. Finally, where SPMs contacted the HSD directly to raise a transaction

      reconciliation issue, then I understood that the HSD could refer this to the SSC

      for investigation. The SSC might then ask the CSPOA Security Team to check

      whether the transaction was already on the automated reports and under

      investigation. If the HSD contacted the team directly, then we would check

      whether the transaction was already under investigation, and, if necessary,

      raise the matter to the SSC.


19.   1 have been asked to describe my role in the investigation of errors reported by

      system users. I did not work on the HSD and did not communicate directly with


                                     Page 5018
                                                                                          WITNO0300100
                                                                                       WITNO0300100




      SPMs. Aside from my limited role in the transaction reconciliation process

      described in paragraphs 13 to 18 above (which was largely in response to

      automated reports and did not generally relate to errors reported by system

      users), I had no role in the investigation of errors reported by system users.


20.   On occasion, I was requested to provide the Post Office with records of calls

      made to the HSD by a particular post office branch and (if requested) to

      summarise these in witness statements. While I therefore did have access to

      the historic HSD call records, I would only be looking at them when requested

      to do so as part of this task. I was not party to the calls themselves and had no

      role in investigating any errors (except as described above in relation to

      transaction reconciliation) or communicating with system users about them.


ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE


21.   I have been asked to explain how the HSD worked and my role within it,

      including the various reporting lines and how problems were escalated. I did not

      work within the HSD and had no role within it. While I know in general terms

      what the HSD did, I cannot say in detail how it worked, what the reporting lines

      were or how problems were escalated within it.


22. I am also asked to explain how calls were prioritised and whether this affected

      how problems were escalated. As I did not work within the HSD I cannot say

      how calls were prioritised by the HSD, or what effect this had on how problems

      were escalated.


23. I am aware that the HSD recorded calls on the TRIOLE for Services ("TfS")

      system, but that if the matter required further investigation it would be



                                     Page 6 of 18
                                                                                            WITNO0300100
                                                                                        WITNO0300100




      transferred from the TfS system to the PEAK system. I am also aware from

      PEAKs that I have raised myself that incidents can be categorised as either A,

      B, C or D. Category A is the highest level of priority and I believe required a

      resolution within four hours. Category B required a resolution within eight hours

      and categories C and D had longer time limits.


24. My attention has been drawn to a Peak Incident Management System report for

      call reference PCO223333 raised on 4 February 2013 (FUJ00082289). This is

      an example of a PEAK raised by me as part of the transaction reconciliation

      process that I describe at paragraphs 13 to 18 above.


25.   The PEAK summary states: "Branch 153113 — NB102 Section 5 EPAY — State

      4 and Failed Recovery". From this I understand that this PEAK relates to an

      EPAY transaction at the stated branch which is stuck in `state 4'. This

      transaction would have been on one of the transaction reconciliation reports

      generated for that day, and I would have been tasked with following the

      relevant procedure for a transaction stuck in state 4 by raising a PEAK for the

      SSC to investigate.


26. The summary also references `Failed Recovery'. This is a reference to a

      separate report also generated each day. Quite often a stuck transaction would

      be resolved automatically when the SPM rebooted their counter terminal the

      following day. If not, then I understood that the transaction would additionally be

      listed on the failed recovery report. The transaction being discussed in

      FUJO0082289 is listed in both reports, and I am making the SSC aware of this

      in accordance with the procedure.

                                                                                       WITNO0300100




27.   Aside from changing the relevant transaction details, the majority of the text in

      my initial entry at 09:13:33 will have been copied and pasted from our standard

      procedure for dealing with a transaction stuck in state 4.


28.   1 have been asked what I meant by the words "PLEASE include further txn

      attempts with the same PAN immediately after this txn if applicable as this is

      useful for Post Office Ltd for settlement issues." My recollection is that these

      words formed part of the standard procedure for dealing with a transaction

      stuck in state 4 and I copied and pasted them into the PEAK.


29.   I was not the original author of these words, but I understand them to be an

      instruction to the SSC to look at other transaction ('txn') attempts with the same

      Primary Account Number or 'PAN' (the unique reference number associated

      with the payment card) immediately following the stuck transaction. I

      understand that such information would be useful for the SSC's investigation in

      order to ensure that the transaction was settled correctly (i.e. that the funds

      were correctly debited and credited to the relevant accounts). For example, this

      would show if multiple payment attempts had been made with the same

      payment card.


30.   My attention has also been drawn to an entry from the Known Errors Log

      ("KEL") database with reference number acha1717T titled 'Branch reports an

      unexplained discrepancy' raised by Anne Chambers on 30 July 2010

      (FUJ00082302). I understood that the KEL was maintained and used by the

      SSC for the purpose of investigating and recording errors. While I, in common

      with many others, had access to the KEL, I would not routinely view KEL




                                     Page 8 of 18

                                                                                    WITNO0300100




     records and had no responsibility for writing them. My name is not referenced in

     this document, and I have no recollection of ever having seen it before.


31. Aside from my involvement in the transaction reconciliation process, described

     in paragraphs 13 to 18 above, I was not responsible for dealing with

     discrepancies raised by end users and have no knowledge about what Fujitsu's

     policy was in relation to unexplained discrepancies.


32. I am asked to consider the following extract from FUJ00082302: "When

    responding, if they have given specific examples that you can explain, do so;

     otherwise make clear it is not a system problem (assuming you have checked

     that everything adds up). See PCPCO229446 for an example response which

    may help with the wording."


33. I have not been provided by the Inquiry with a copy of the document being

    referred to in this extract and have no recollection as to whether I have ever

     seen it, or what it contains. I am not the author of FUJ00082302 and cannot

     comment on the purpose of the example response.


34. I am asked to describe the process by which the HSD operators were expected

     to `check that everything adds up', and whether there was a mechanism within

    Fujitsu for HSD operators to escalate with the Post Office or Fujitsu any

    particular trends or issues that emerged. As I was not an HSD operator, I

     cannot comment on these questions.


KNOWLEDGE OF BUGS AND ERRORS


35. I am asked how trends in issues notified to the HSD operators by SPMs were

    monitored and recorded. In general terms, I understood that SPMs would


                                    Page 9 of 18
                                                                                          WITNO0300100
                                                                                      WITNO0300100




      contact the HSD and that HSD operators would make records of the calls on

      the TfS system. I understood that where issues required further investigation

      the call would be transferred to the PEAK system and referred to the

      appropriate team, such as the SSC. I also understood that known errors could

      be recorded by the SSC in the KEL. However, as I did not work within the HSD

      or the SSC I am unable to provide any details about how any trends in such

      issues were monitored or recorded.


36.   To the best of my recollection, aside from the transaction reconciliation process

      described in paragraphs 13 to 18 above, the only other occasion on which I had

      any involvement with the calls being raised by SPMs was when I was asked to

      provide extracts of the archived HSD call records to the Post Office. While I

      was sometimes asked to summarise in a witness statement the nature of the

      issues being raised in those records by a particular branch, I was not

      responsible for performing any analysis of trends in issues being raised by

      SPMs more generally.


37. I am asked to consider a document titled 'Reconciliation and Incident

      Management Joint Working Document', dated 18 March 2013 and authored by

      'Donna Munro, CS Security, Fujitsu Services' (FUJ00085359). Ms Munro was

      the Operational Security Manager, and my line manager, at the time.


38.   I am named in the distribution list for the document, along with others. I note

      that that the document was issued to me 'for information' only and that I was

      not on the list of mandatory or optional reviewers (pages 4-5). I was aware of

      the existence of this document, and would likely have referred to it from time to

      time as necessary, but had no involvement in its creation or review. As I have

     said, my role was very process driven and I did not need to understand how or

     why everything worked; I simply needed to know which process to follow in a

     particular situation.


39. I am asked to describe how reconciliation errors were reported and by whom,

     what happened when an error was notified and how it was investigated, and

     what action was taken in response to the notification of such errors and by

     whom. I have described the process of dealing with transaction reconciliations

     in paragraphs 13 to 18 above.


40. I am asked to consider an excel document last modified by Matthew Lenton on

     10 January 2019 at 5:23pm which appears to be a list of tasks created between

     2006 to 2018 (FUJ00087700). I have no recollection of ever having seen this

     document before. It appears to be a list of tasks associated with particular

     change requests. I note that the document lists 19,435 lines but has been

     filtered to show just 61 tasks, none of which were last updated by me. A total of

     331 tasks within this document were last updated by me. I note that many of

     these 331 tasks relate to failed recovery or delayed transactions, which was

     part of the transaction reconciliation process that I describe in paragraphs 13 to

     18 above. Many of the other tasks last updated by me relate to OBC19

     requests; these were requests from the Post Office for updates or changes

     within the Post Office Data Gateway (PODG), the automated file transfer

     system used for transferring files between the Post Office and third parties such

     as financial institutions and utility providers.


41. I am asked to describe the method by which errors were escalated by Fujitsu,

     the process for logging errors and who had access to historic error logs.

42. In respect of the escalation and logging of errors, in general terms I was aware

     that there were various lines of support through which issues/errors could be

     escalated. The HSD provided `first line' support to end users experiencing

     issues with Horizon. TfS call records would be kept by the HSD of the issues

     raised. Where an issue raised required further investigation, the TfS call would

     have been transferred to the PEAK system, for action by the appropriate team,

     such as the SSC. I understood that where the investigation concluded that a

     change was required to the Horizon code, that this would then be escalated to

     the software developers to make the change, test it, and then roll it out. As

     described above, I also understood that the SSC could record known errors

     (and, if applicable, how to resolve them) within the KEL database. However, I

     was not involved in that process.


43. In respect of access to `historic error logs' (which I understand to mean the

     KEL), my understanding was that anyone who had access to the PEAK system

     would have been able to access the KEL records. I was able to click into or

     search for KEL records through the PEAK system, and did view some such

     records on the occasions that this was required for my role. The PEAK system

     was widely used within CSPOA for assigning actions on tickets to particular

     teams, so many people needed to have access to the system. As far as I was

     aware, once a person had been given access to the PEAK system they had full

     access to all records held within it, and could therefore have accessed any of

     the KEL records.


44. My attention is drawn to a KEL record titled `Multiple cash declarations may

     cause incorrect figures in Discrepancy, Variance and Balance Reports' raised

      by Mark Scardifield on 15 July 2005 with reference number MScardifield2219S

      (FUJ00082274). I am not named in this document and I have no recollection of

      whether I have seen it before.


45. I note that the KEL record was last modified by Anne Chambers on 27

      November 2007 and the type is shown as `unresolved'. I am asked whether

      there was a process in place to deal with issues marked as unresolved. I did

      not work within the SSC and was not responsible for investigating such issues,

      creating or maintaining the KEL, or tracking whether issues recorded in the KEL

      had been resolved.


46.   I am asked to look at a spreadsheet last modified by Pat Lywood on 17 June

      2010 at 10:55am, which according to the 'Preamble' worksheet appears to

      have been prepared for the 'CS Prayers' meeting (FUJ00084433). I am aware

      that the CS (Customer Service) Prayers meeting took place every morning and

      was attended by CSPOA management. As far as I can recall, I have never

      attended a CS Prayers meeting, and as far as I am aware, I have never seen

      this document before. The document appears to list various PEAKs and to track

      the progress of their investigation and resolution, however, as I was not present

      at the CS Prayers meetings, I cannot say how it was used.


47. My attention is drawn to item 622 on the 'Detail' worksheet which relates to

      PEAK PC0198077, described as "This is where following rollover, if there is a

      discrepancy, the branch is able to clear their local suspense multiple times."

      note that my name is not mentioned anywhere in connection with this item. As

      far I am aware, I had no involvement in dealing with this issue; this is not the

      sort of thing that I would be dealing with as part of my role.

48.   I have been asked to describe the function of the 'local suspense' account and

      whether the issue described in item 622 was rectified. I do not know what a

      local suspense account is, and do not understand what it is that item 622 is

      describing. I have no knowledge as to whether the issue was rectified. As such,

      I cannot say how it was rectified, what steps were taken in relation to it by

      anyone, or whether Fujitsu informed the Post Office or the relevant SPM about

      it.


INTEGRITY OF THE SYSTEM


49.   I have been shown copies of various internal security audit/assessment reports.

      I am asked to explain why internal assessments or audits of the system were

      carried out, the process by which they were carried out by Fujitsu, how the

      results of previous assessments or audits were traced and what records were

      kept of them.


50. I was not responsible for carrying out or managing internal audits or

      assessments, though I was on occasion asked questions as part of the audits

      that were carried out.


51.   In general terms, I understood that the purpose of carrying out an internal

      assessment or audit was to ensure that our internal documented processes

      were in compliance with the applicable national and international standards,

      and that we were operating in compliance with our own documented processes.


52.   1 also knew that CSPOA would be externally audited against these standards.

      One of the purposes of the internal audit was therefore to ensure that we were




                                   Page 14 of 18
                                                                                         WITNO0300100
                                                                                    WITNO0300100




     in compliance with the standards, and that any non-conformances were

     addressed, prior to the external audit taking place.


53. I was not involved in conducting the audits, so cannot say how exactly they

     were carried out, save that I was aware that the auditors would look at

     documents and raise questions with relevant personnel. For example, I can see

     from a document titled `Local Security Audit Report - Networks — 2009', dated

     18 August 2009 and authored by Nigel Hatcher, RMGA Quality Manager

     (FUJ00080805), that I was contacted by the auditors by email regarding the

     appropriate classification of a document that I had written about the process for

     out of hours support team members who needed to change their passwords. It

     appears from the report that I responded by email to explain that as the

     authentication process for access to the system had changed, the document

     that I had authored was now obsolete and would not be taken forward. This

     type of exchange typified my involvement in the audit process.


54   Following the audits, I understood that a report would be produced by the

     auditors which would record any non-conformances, observations and required

     corrective actions. Where corrective actions were assigned to me, I would

     complete them. I assume that the auditors had some way of tracing the actions

     raised and whether they had been completed, but I was not responsible for this

     process and so cannot comment on how it worked.


55   I am aware that reports were written following the audits/assessments, as some

     of these were sent to me. However, I do not know what other records were kept

     by the auditors of the work they carried out.

                                                                                     WITNO0300100




      I am asked to consider a spreadsheet last modified by Pat Lywood on 8 June

      2010 at 10:38am, which appears to be a version of the CS Prayers

      spreadsheet described above, but from a different date (FUJ00084385). Again,

     I did not attend these meetings and have no recollection of having seen this

      document (or any other version of it) before.


57. My attention is drawn to item 192 on the `closed' worksheet of the document

     which relates to PEAK PC194590, described as "Duplicate JSNs present in the

     HNG-X counter audit trail'. I note that, as with item 622 addressed above, my

     name is not mentioned anywhere in connection with this item.


58. I am asked to explain the following comment recorded in the document in

     respect of this item: "From an Audit perspective this is a bit of a disaster. The

     Audit system uses the JSNs to confirm the completeness & integrity of retrieved

     audit data. This retrieved data may well end up being used in court cases to

     support POL prosecutions for fraud etc. The presence of duplicates or gaps in

     the JSN sequence would totally discredit this data and would probably end up

     supporting the usual defence claim in such cases that any financial losses were

     as a result of errors within the system".


59. I understand that each transaction that took place on each Horizon counter

     terminal was assigned a Journal Sequence Number ("JSN"), and that each

     sequential transaction on the terminal should be assigned a sequential JSN.


60. I recall that an issue arose in around 2010 with the data that we were exporting

     in response to ARQs made by the Post Office, I recall the issue involved there

     being both gaps in the data that we were exporting (i.e. the JSNs shown were

     not sequential) and duplicated transactions (i.e. transactions showing the same


                                    Page 16 of 18

                                                                                     WITN00300100




     JSN). My recollection is that we stopped doing ARQ exports for a short time

     while this issue was resolved.


61. While it is clearly a problem for there to be gaps or duplicates in any data, I am

     unable to comment on the impact that this might have on court cases, as this is

     outside of my expertise. The quoted extract was not my remark and so I cannot

     comment on why the author has said it.
