Dear ~~ SOY,
Related Agreements between Secretary of State for Social
Security, Post Office Counters Limited and ICL Pathway Limited

dated 15 May 1996

I am writing on behalf of both Authorities to give notice of
preach of the above contracts, as you have failed to complete
the Operational Trial by the designated contractual milestone
of 21 November 1997. We are reserving our position on rights
and remedies resulting from this breach until further notice,
but do not intend to exercise these at present.

On the contrary, it is our current intention to continue in
discussions with you on re-planning the way forward of this
Programme. For the avoidance of doubt, however, these
discussions are without prejudice and subject to contract.

Yours sincerely

Peter Crahan
Programme Director
