1 Introduction
This manual provides a high-level description of the activities of the Support
Services Unit within Pathway Customer Service.

2 Scope
This manual primarily provides a description of the operations of the CS
Support Services Unit. However, to put these operations in context, it also
describes some of the activities of other units where they are relevant. This is
particularly the case in the software release management area. There are
other manuals that describe operations within the other areas of Pathway
Customer Service.
Where necessary, in addition to this manual, there are process documents,
lower-level procedures and work instructions that describe some of the
operations in more detail.
Appendix A, at the end of the manual, contains diagrams of some of the
processes.

3 Overview

The purpose of the CS Support Services Unit is to support Pathway Customer
Service in the day-to-day delivery of the Pathway solution. The prime
operational units are:

« System Support Centre (SSC)
Responsible for all support activities, and, in particular, it provides third line
support for all applications in the Pathway estate

« Operational Test Team (OTT)
Tests all software fixes and, where applicable, changes to reference data to
ensure there is no risk to the live service

e Release Management (RM)

Responsible for the release of software changes to the live estate

4 System Support Centre
This section of the manual describes the operations and responsibilities of
the System Support Centre (SSC).

4.1 Overview

4.1.1 SSC responsibil

The principles by which the SSC operates are documented in End-to-End
Support Process Operational Level Agreement (CS/FSP/006) which defines
the responsibilities of the four levels of support towards each other. This
document is effectively a service level agreement between the support units,
outlining specific tasks and measures of success.

The aim of the SSC is to provide a support capability to Pathway that
resolves technical problems in the minimum time and with the minimum
amount of disruption to the service. The SSC aims to provide a centre of
technical expertise for Customer Service, providing technical advice,
guidance, and expertise relating to all parts of the Pathway system.

More specifically the SSC has responsibilities to:

First and second line support

Fourth line support

ities to first and second line support

The responsibilities of the SSC to first and second line support, that is the
Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH) and the System Management Centre (SMC)
respectively, are to:

1. Receive incidents passed from the HSH and SMC

2. Ensure that any incidents received are maintained on the call
management system. When updates are made to the calls that are
relevant to the HSH or SMC, the SSC ensures that these updates reach
the Powerhelp system

3. Ensure that the reported incident is resolved correctly and the solution is
recorded on the PinICL system

4. Ensure that the incident and solution are passed back to the HSH and
SMC call management system. The solution includes a full explanation for
the problem and the action taken to resolve it

5. Ensure that the incident is resolved within the total time allowed by the
contract between the customer and Pathway

Version: 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 29/01/01

6. Ensure that the HSH and SMC are made aware of the evidence
requirements for any form of incident and that this documentation is fully
maintained

7. Create and maintain a register of known deficiencies within the Pathway
system and the solution to these problems, where known

8. Allow the HSH and SMC access to this register so that they can fulfil their
function of filtering out known errors

9. Ensure that any solutions or workarounds they pass to the SMC have
been tested and have been correctly authorised via the software release
management process

10. Ensure that the HSH and SMC are supplied with documentation relating to
new releases of software in sufficient time to enable their staff to become
familiar with the product prior to its release

11.Ensure that, for any incident which has been solved and passed back to
the Powerhelp system, the customer has been contacted and made aware
of the call closure

12.Hold workshops and skills transfer sessions relating to technical aspects
of the Pathway system and diagnostic techniques

13. Ensure that the following figures are available to the HSH and SMC on
demand:

(a) Number of calls by priority currently outstanding with the SSC

(b) Number of calls where resolution has been deferred to the next
release

(c) Number of calls by age currently outstanding with the SSC or fourth
line support unit

4.1.2 SSC responsibilities to fourth line support
The responsibilities of the SSC to fourth line support are to:
1. Log all calls on a call management system

2. Filter out all calls for which the problem is already known to the support
community and for which a solution is already known or has been
generated. This includes problems for which the SSC knows a resolution
but has not yet incorporated the resolution into the known error log

3. Retain duplicate incidents in the PinICL systems and ensure that when the
resolved incident is received by the SSC the duplicated calls are closed.

Duplicate incidents are repetitions of an incident that has already been
passed to fourth line support.

4. Ensure that the correct evidence for any problem is collected prior to the
incident being passed to fourth line support for investigation.

5. Ensure that any incident that requires investigation by fourth line support
is assigned to the correct PinICL team depending upon the specific
product in which the incident has occurred

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 29/01/01

6. Ensure that any updates made to incidents passed to the SSC are sent to
the fourth line support units

7. Ensure that any calls passed to fourth line support units are passed in a
timely manner. The timing varies depending on the priority of a call

8. Ensure that the priority of any incident is assessed and recorded correctly
9. Filter out all calls for which the problem is not one of the following:

(a) Software error

(b) Documentation error

10. Ensure that for any incident passed to fourth line support the exact area of
the problem has been identified and, wherever possible, a workaround
has already been produced

11.Ensure that, for any code error, a probable solution is indicated prior to
passing the incident to fourth line support and, wherever possible, the
proposed solution has undergone limited testing

12. Accept full responsibility for the product, including fourth line support, and
for the production of any code required to resolve incidents, for areas of
the Pathway system where the product has matured, that is, no further
releases of the product are expected

13.Create and maintain a register of known deficiencies of the Pathway
system and the solution to these problems, where known, and allow
access to this register to fourth line units so that they can enter details of
solutions created within their area

4.2 Applications support

Appendix A in this manual contains process diagrams showing the roles of
the support units.

4.2.1 Role of first line support

The HSH run by OSD, provides first line support to Horizon system users.
The helpdesk has its own procedures, Horizon System Helpdesk Incident
Procedures (DSP/PRO/HH/010). The HSH uses Powerhelp, an application
supplied by Astea Inc, as its helpdesk system.

When the HSH receives a service call, its first task is to determine whether or
not the call relates to a hardware or software problem. For hardware
problems, it contacts OSD to schedule engineers and, if necessary, spare
parts to resolve the problem. Hardware and networking issues should be
resolved through operational resilience or change control processes and
should not be passed through to the SSC.

The HSH also does not pass requests for advice and guidance to the SSC.
that it can provide directly to the customer.

However, if it cannot resolve a call quickly, or if there is a possibility of a
software problem, the Helpdesk transfers the call to the second line support
team for further investigation.

4.2.2 Role of second line support

4.2.3

The System Management Centre (SMC) is also run by OSD and provides
second line support to Horizon system users. On receipt of a call from the
HSH, the SMC's first task is to determine whether or not the service call is a
software code problem.

The SMC also uses Powerhelp as its helpdesk system. The system has an
Open Teleservice Interface (OTI) link to the SSC's call management system.

The HSH will have prioritised the call according to the criticality of the fault as
follows:

Priority Meaning Notes
A Business stopped A post office that is wholly inoperative and
unable to process any business
B Business restricted A post office that is restricted in its ability to
transact business, for example, one counter
inoperative
Cc Non-critical A post office that is working normally, but with a

known incapacity, for example, an interim
solution has been provided

D Internal An internal HSH/SMC problem, for example, a
helpdesk PC or a telephone not working

SMC carry out any appropriate pre-authorised activities for resilience and
recovery purposes as defined in their procedures. Both HSH and SMC have
access to KELs (Known Error Logs) which contain authorised workarounds
and repetitive manual action that they can implement.

If the service request call indicates a software problem which has been seen
before, and for which a workaround is already available, the SMC follows its
own internal procedures to ensure that the workaround is passed to the
customer.

If the service request call indicates a software problem which has been seen
before, and for which a workaround is not available, the SMC links the current
call to the first call and does not pass the call to the SSC. This ensures that
the SSC does not receive duplicate calls for the same problem.

If the service call indicates a software problem that has not been seen before,
the SMC follows its own internal procedures to pass the call to the SSC,
providing information about the problem and Pathway's exposure, that is, the
number of calls received and the potential number of counters that are
affected. They also provide details about the software version installed on the
platform.

Role of third line support

The System Support Centre (SSC) within Pathway Customer Service
provides third line support for most applications.

FUJ00120446
FUJ00120446

ICL Pathway CS Support Services Operations Manual Ref: CS/QMS/004
Version: 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 29/01/01

The SSC uses PinICL as its call management system and diagnostic
database. Calls from second line support are transferred from Powerhelp to
PinICL via an OTI link, and updates to the PinICL calls are transferred back
to second line support using the same mechanism.

When the SSC receives a call from second line support, second line support
has already assessed the call as a software problem and flagged it with the
appropriate priority. The SSC handles the call as follows:

1. The SSC checks details of known problems on the intranet site to
determine whether or not the problem is similar or identical to a problem
already known.

2. If the problem is known, the SSC carries out any pre-authorised actions
that are available to it, for example, workarounds in the KEL

3. If the problem is not known, the SSC checks the diagnostic evidence and,
if necessary, obtains further evidence from the live system to determine
the nature of the fault.

The SSC also uses its reference kit to recreate the symptoms reported by
the customer and may then be able to obtain diagnostic data in a
controlled fashion

4. If the problem is identified as a code fault, the SSC determines the area of
code that has failed and, if possible, identifies a solution to the problem for
fourth line support to implement. If possible, it tests the proposed solution
before passing the call to fourth line support

5. If the problem is urgent, that is, a workaround has not been found, the
SSC escalates the problem to fourth line support via PinICL. Note that any
urgent corrective action is a one-off implementation of the solution to the
problem.

If the problem is not urgent, for example, a workaround has been
implemented, the customer is satisfied and the support call has been
cleared, the SSC still passes the problem to fourth line support via PinICL
to generate a permanent fix. However, the SSC Manager may lower the
priority of the PinICL to reflect the lack of urgency of the problem

6. If the problem is not identified as a code fault, the SSC identifies the exact
nature of the fault and isolates the system that caused the symptoms. This
may happen, for example, when the code is operating within specification
but the customer reports symptoms which were not expected

7. Once the SSC has passed the call to fourth line support, it remains
responsible for ensuring that the call is dealt with in a timely manner and
for informing the SMC and HSH of any updates to the call

8. The SSC identifies the software that needs to be released permanently to
the live environment as the long-term solution to the problem and notifies
the CSRM accordingly

Note. Closing calls on PinICL and Powerhelp

e The SSC closes a call on PiniICL when a resolution has been identified for
the call and the details passed to the SMC, for example, a definition of the
release that will contain the fix, as detailed in the release management
process

e The SMC and HSH use PowerHelp and close a call when the fix has been
distributed to the relevant equipment. This may be fairly simple if it is on
the central servers, but it may involve considerable work if it requires a
code release to all post office counters

4.2.4 Role of fourth line support

The fourth line support unit receives the request and does one of the
following:

e Returns with a recommendation for action that the SSC can carry out

e Returns with a workaround that the SSC can progress as if it had
generated it

e Rejects the request, for example, on the grounds that the problem will be
resolved in a system software release that is due imminently

e Identifies a fix but does not produce it until authorised by the Release
Management Forum

Where necessary, internal Pathway fourth line support also provides the
interface with PinICL for external fourth line support units and updates the
PinICL with progress reports.

A number of units provide fourth line support to the Pathway system as
described in the following sections.

4.2.4.1 Pathway Development and A&TC

These development teams use the PinlICL system to manage calls. Their
process is essentially the same as the SSC with the exception that any
development required to resolve a problem goes through the release
management process.

The SSC and the development team discuss the problem and assign the
PinICL call to either a specific development team, if the product has been
identified, or to the general development team, if not.

If the development team requires additional information, it redirects the call
back to the SSC which returns the call to the development team once they
have obtained the required additional information.

If a patch is produced to resolve the call, this is handled through the release
management process.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 29/01/01

4.2.1.2 I Escher

Escher also uses the PinlICL system. The process for routing a call to Escher
is via the Pathway development team and therefore the process is as
described above.

4.2.1.3 OSD

Generally where OSD acts as fourth line support, it also has responsibility for
first, second and third line support - therefore, the procedures involved are
entirely OSD internal procedures. In those instances where SSC, not OSD,
provides third line support the procedures as defined in 4.2.4.1 will be
followed.

4.2.1.4 Eicon

Eicon do not use the PinlCL system, but require calls to be logged by calling
:. Note that this telephone diverts outside normal office hours
to Eicon’s Canadian call centre. 12 SSC staff are registered with Eicon as
having the authority to raise calls, and 2 SSC staff members have undergone
training with Eicon in diagnostic requirements.

Escalation to Eicon management for any issues is via the SSC manager and
the Eicon Service manager. As of 30/12/1999 this was Dan Dixon,

The Eicon contract is held in FELO1 by the Finance Director

4.3 Operational change

The SSC has access to the live system which can be used to correct data on
the system when this has been corrupted in some way. The procedure for
doing this is as follows:

The originator of the change:

1. Completes an Operational Correction Request (OCR) form for every
change to data on the live system.

The originator may be anyone within ICL Pathway, but is normally the
Duty Manager, or a Problem Manager or Business Support Manager when
an incident or problem has been caused by an error in the data. It can
also be completed by an SSC staff member who detects that the data in
the system has become corrupted in the course of diagnosing a fault

2. Emails the OCR form to an authoriser, electronically signing it where
possible, and where this is not possible, telephoning the authoriser to
confirm that they are sending an OCR.

FUJ00120446

ICL Pathway CS Support Services Operations Manual Ref: CS/QMS/004
Version: 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 29/01/01

The authoriser must be one of the following:
e Duty Manager
« Business Support Manager
« CS Operations Manager
e SSC Manager
e Release Manager
The authoriser:

1. Authorises the change, or reports back to the originator why they are not
authorising the change

2. Forwards the OCR form to the SSC electronically with an encrypted
electronic signature file

The SSC staff member who is to perform the change:
3. Checks the electronic signature of the authoriser

4. Stores the OCR form and the signature file in the received OCRs folder
on the SSC server

5. Wherever possible, produces a script to make the data change and tests
the script on the SSC reference rig prior to running it on the live system

6. Completes the relevant sections on the OCR form to confirm whether they
have produced and tested a script or not

7. Prior to making the change on the live system, documents the state of the
affected part of the system and completes the regression path details on
the OCR form.

Note. If no regression path is possible, this must be stated on the OCR
form

8. Makes the change on the live system.

At least two people must be present when making changes to the live
system. Normally these are SSC staff, but can be one SSC staff member
and one person from the fourth line support unit responsible for the area
in which the data change will take place, or one SSC staff member and
one OSD staff member

SSC reference kit

Overview

The SSC reference kit consists of two rigs at BRAO1. One is the reference rig
for the live system and the other is the reference rig for the next release of
software.

OSD maintains both rigs. The live reference rig is operated and managed by
OSD. The second rig is operated and managed by SSC staff.

The general requirement is for the SSC to have reference kit that mirrors as
closely as possible the equipment in use at any post office. The function of
this kit is to duplicate problems reported by customers in a controlled fashion.
The SSC also uses the reference kit to provide a link to live system diagnosis
and, where authorised, data change.

Updating the hardware asset register

The SSC maintains a hardware asset register for all of Pathway CS. The
following section describes the procedure to add to and remove hardware
from the asset register. Note that this procedure includes all CS IT kit not just
reference kit.

Adding new hardware

Whenever hardware is added within Pathway CS at Bracknell the asset
register is updated. The CS staff member sends an email to the SSC
Manager in the following format:

Asset Serial

Asset Manufact Serial
Asset Product

Asset Owner

Asset Owner Building
Asset Owner Location

4.5 Diagnostic information

The SSC, as third line support for products in the Pathway system, has
responsibility for ensuring that first and second line support units are
provided with sufficient information to enable them to diagnose known
problems correctly and to provide advice and guidance to the customers.

In this way, support requests from customers that are passed to the SSC

should be restricted to either complex end-to-end process problems that

require in-depth analysis of all of the systems involved or new software faults.
4.5.1 Maintaining the Known Error Log on the SSC intranet site

The SSC generates and maintains a Known Error Log (KEL) system that uses
searchable documents in HTML format. The mechanism for searching is a
query entry in an intranet site. The KEL system is available to first, second,
third and fourth line support units as well as SSC staff.

4.5.2 Transferring knowledge between support units

The SSC intranet site has KEL search facilities and other useful diagnostic
data, documents and tools.

SSC and SMC staff raise KELs based on customer-observed symptoms.
KELs are further maintained once the fault has been resolved.

4.6 Diagnostic tools

4.6.1 Overview

The SSC develops and maintains tools that can assist in the diagnostic
process. The SSC diagnosticians develop the tools themselves; the individual
authors are responsible for maintaining these developments.

Development is performed on an ad hoc basis whenever there is a
requirement to generate a tool to assist in the diagnosis of faults.

All diagnostic tools are registered on the SSC intranet site.

The tools themselves are made available to all members of the SSC and,
where they are able to assist other support units within Pathway, they are
made accessible together with any documentation about their use.

Version: 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 29/01/01

4.6.2 Developing diagnostic tools

Before developing a diagnostic tool, establish whether or not the required tool
has already been produced by reference to the diagnostic tools database on
the SSC intranet site. This database contains details of known diagnostic
tools developed in the SSC and by other support units.

1. If a suitable tool already exists, it should be used

2. If a suitable tool does not already exist, the SSC staff member:
(a) Defines the requirement for the tool to the SSC Manager
(b) Waits for authorisation before proceeding

3. If the diagnostician has sufficient development skills to develop the tool
him or herself, the SSC Manager schedules the development work
required

4. If the diagnostician does not have sufficient development skills to develop
the tool, the SSC Manager:

(a) If these skills are available within the SSC, identifies the resource
required to develop the tool

(b) If necessary, goes outside the SSC to obtain the development
resource

5. Log the fact that the tool is being developed in the diagnostic tools
database on the SSC intranet site and forward this information to all of the
relevant units which may have use of this tool

6. Maintain a copy of the tool in the diagnostic database on the SSC intranet
site

4.7 SSC intranet site

This site was created by and is maintained by SSC staff, although it provides
a resource for other support staff within the Pathway estate.

The following sections describe the key features of the site. As the contents
of the site are under constant review, the following details may change.

4.7.1. Known Error Logs (KELs)

The intranet site holds known error details in Microsoft Word format, the
contents of which may be searched for, in full text form. Documents are
created to a defined template wherever possible. An application has been
generated which limits the properties of the document to a subset of possible
values, for clarity and ease of search. This application is made available to all
support units.

The process for creating KEL entries outside of the SSC has not yet been
formulated, but it is expected that no KEL will be allowed onto the system
before it has been authorised by SSC staff.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 29/01/01
4.7.2 Change proposals

4.7.3

The intranet site holds copies of each Change Proposal (CP) in a searchable
form as Microsoft Word documents. These documents are not definitive. As
copies of the CPs are taken before they reach the Pathway Change Control
Board the status of any CP is indeterminate - it may, or may not, have been
approved.

Maintaining the CPs in this form allows diagnosticians to see that someone
has looked at an activity in an area of the Pathway operations regardless of
whether or not that activity was actually carried out.

Release management

The Release Management database is held on the same server as the
Intranet site. This database is used to control the flow of fixes through the
Operational Testing processes and through release to the live environment.

The intranet site provides a controlled interface to this database, allowing
searches to be made by:

« Date
For example, show all fixes applied to the live environment since date xxxx

e = PinICL
For example, show the state of a PinlCL in the release process (delivered, due to
be tested, due to be released to live)

4.7.4

47.5

Similar searches can be made on a Release note as described for a PinICL.

Operational Change/Corrections

The intranet site holds copies of both SSC Operational Correction Requests
and OSD Operation Change Requests. The intention being to provide a
mechanism in which both urgent and planned changes at the operational
level can be viewed quickly.

OSD have control over the OSD change requests, and the SSC intranet site
provides a repository and search mechanism only. For SSC Correction
requests, inserting the data into the intranet server is mandated by the
process — Appendix B of this document.

Work Instructions

There is a requirement for Work Instructions which may augment, or
temporarily replace documented procedures. These are logged and
maintained on the SSC Intranet site. There is a password protection
mechanism, so that only the SSC manager, or nominated deputy, can create
new, or amend existing Work Instructions. All staff are allowed to search the
work instructions

4.7.6 Other facilities

48

The intranet site also contains smaller sections that provide:
1. Links to commonly used web sites

2. A bulletin board for SSC staff to add points of interest regarding the
operation of the live system

3. Access to commonly used SQL queries and other items of code
4. Access to various documents relating to the live system

Access to the live system

All diagnostic staff in the SSC (product specialists and systems specialists)
have access to the live system via PCs (see Appendix D for build details) that
are connected to a private LAN in BRAO1. Patch panels enable staff to use
these PCs to access the test rigs in BRAO1.

The build script for these PCs was written by OSD, but is held in the SSC.
The PC build was performed in accordance with the Access Control Policy.

Access from the PCs to the live system to the live system is controlled by
SecurelD, uses firewalls, and an encrypted link, and conforms to the Access
Control Policy.

The SSC access to the system is for two purposes:

e Assist in diagnosis of problems on the live system

e Correct data which has become corrupted

49

In the second case, SSC staff may only correct data in response to an
authorised Operational Correction Request and only then when there are two
or more people present.

Additional technical support to Pathway CS

In addition to the normal support activities, the SSC provides other technical
resources to Pathway CS. It is the only unit with sufficient access to the live
systems to be able, for example, to analyse:

e Riposte message store

e Counter event logs

e Central system NT event logs
Consequently, the SSC runs daily checks for:

e Post offices that have not communicated with the central systems for 24
hours

e Any NT events that indicate that TIP processing has failed or that
transactions have not been harvested

It is also able to respond to other specific requests such as:

5 Operational Test Team (OTT)

The Operational Test Team (OTT) within Pathway CS is responsible for
testing fixes prior to their application to the live environment to ensure that
they work and do not adversely affect the environment.

5.1 Overview
To test a software fix, the Operational Test Team carries out the following
activities:

e Scheduling the testing

e Controlling the testing

e Recording rig problems

e Controlling OTT documents

e Recording the fix level of a rig
The following sections describe the process.

5.2 Scheduling testing
The main test scheduling task is carried out using the Release Management
Data Base in conjunction with Release Management.
The OTT team does the following:
1. Populates the OTT testing cycle on the RMDB and allocate resource.
2. Ensures that sufficient documentation is available for the testing purposes
3. Receives Release Note from RM
4. Liaises with OSD to get the fix applied to the test rig
5. Files the documentation when testing is complete.

If the fix is rejected during testing due to a fault, OTT send it back to the
relevant unit for correction..

If multiple software fixes are included on one Release Note, one may fail
while the others are successful. In this case, if the fixes are dependent on
each other the whole release is rejected, or, if the fixes are independent
the Release Note may continue and the failed element is re-scheduled to
join a later release of fixes.

6. Updates the release database to show the fix has been tested
successfully (or rejected (with a reason))

7. OTT sends the software fix release note back to Release Management.

5.3 Controlling testing

This section describes how the OTT control testing.

When fixes are fast tracked, some of the preparation, for example,
documentation, may have been delayed until after the release has been
distributed. Therefore, some of these activities are revisited to complete the
full schedule of preparation and testing as identified on the software fix
release note.

1. Testers use copies of the following information, where relevant :
« Release note
« Relevant PinICLs
« Handover note

2. When a test has been scheduled, the testers carry out the following
actions:

a) Produce the test script
b) Undertake any other preparation necessary for the test

c) Carry out the test to confirm that the problem occurs as expected
) The fix is applied to the test rig (by OSD)
e) Test after the fix has been applied

f) Test after the fix has been regressed

(
(
(
(d
(
(
(

g) Ifthe fix passes the test, pass the relevant documents and the
updated test script to the OTT Manager. If the fix fails the test, return
it to fourth line support for redevelopment.

5.4 Recording rig problems
Rig problems are recorded in log books. There is one log for each of the rigs
used by OTT. The log book is kept by the counters belonging to the rig.

1. Whenever a problem is found on a rig, OTT makes an entry in the
appropriate log book. The kind of incidents that are logged are:

e Hardware faults on any of the kit
e Errors reported by any of the kit
* Communications faults
e A fix applied to all hardware except counters
e A fix removed from all hardware except counters
e Anything for which a call is logged with HSH or SMC
2. The entry in the log book includes the following information:
e Date of the incident.
¢ Details of the incident

e Status of the incident with HSH or SMC. That is, Open, Closed, with
HSH or SMC

3. When the incident is resolved, OTT updates the log with:
¢ Closure information

« Date of closure

5.5 Controlling OTT documents

This section describes how OTT maintain documents and notes.
OTT maintains all documents on the machine Sscdiag4 in folder OTTShare.

5.5.1 Creating a new OTT document

To create a new OTT document, the OTT staff member carries out the
following steps:

1. Allocates a new number for the document from the appropriate index file

2. Updates the index file to show the newly allocated number and prints a
copy of it

3. Creates the new document using the appropriate template
4. Informs other team members that they have created a new document

5.5.2. Updating an existing OTT document

To update an existing document, the OTT staff member carries out the
following steps:

1. Locates the document by referring to the appropriate index file
2. Updates the document
3. Informs other team members that they have changed the document

5.6 Recording the fix level of the test rig
A white board documents the fix level of all the counters attached to the OTT
rig.
OTT updates the white board whenever:

e A fix is applied or removed from a counter

e Acounter is rebuilt or replaced

6 Release Management

This section describes the operations performed by Customer Service
Release Management team. The CS Release Manager (CSRM) is
responsible for authorising changes to the live Horizon environment.

The following procedures are described:

e Deciding whether a software fix should be developed
e Defining the release plan and time scales

« Managing the delivery of supporting services

« Creating the software fix

e Re-raising a release note

e Authorising the software fix

« Completing the release process

Appendix A contains a block diagram of the process.

6.1.1 Deciding whether a software fix should be developed

This section describes how ICL Pathway CS decide if a fix should be
implemented for a problem. See Appendix A.4 process diagram.

1. ICL Pathway CS holds a Release Management Forum weekly to decide
what fixes should be created and to assess the impact of any associated
risk. Representatives of each unit involved in the software release process
attend the RMF meeting as follows:

e System Support Centre

e ICL Pathway Development
e Operational Test Team

e Configuration Management
« Customer Service

e ICL Outsourcing

e Other units as required

The SSC represents the customer in the RMF in terms of the calls made
to the helpdesks. The Service Managers know of other problems that are
significant to the customer, through parallel escalation processes. The

Service Managers feed their knowledge into the RMF through the CSRM

2. The CSRM sends a list of all outstanding open calls to each member in
advance of the RMF meeting, allowing the attendees to identify their
requirements.

© 2001 ICL Pathway Limited COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Page: 25 of 67
FUJ00120446
FUJ00120446

ICL Pathway CS Support Services Operations Manual Ref: CS/QMS/004
Version: 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 29/01/01

The calls are cleared calls, that is, have a corrective action in place and
are awaiting closure, either because the decision has not been made
whether to create a fix, or the decision has been made to create a fix and
it has not been completed

3. Each attendee brings with them information about the dependencies,
priorities, risks, issues, alternative options and time scales for the open
PinlCLs. It may not be possible to estimate how long certain activities will
take until the priorities have been agreed, therefore, some information
may not be available until after the RMF meeting

4. The open calls are discussed, with the information provided by the
members. For example, details of any workaround and business impact,
until the situation is understood. Then the RMF decides whether a release
is required

5. If SSC consider a problem too urgent to wait for the weekly RMF meeting,
it requests the CSRM to fast track the fix.

The CSRM assesses the situation and, based on the priorities of each
unit, the risk of releasing the fix, the alternative options, any dependencies
between fixes and any other issues, decides either the problem can wait
until the weekly RMF meeting or agrees to a fast track solution.

If the fix is fast tracked, the CSRM holds a virtual forum by taking the
release request to each RMF member (in person or by phone, fax or
PinICL) for input and sign off. The activities in the high level plan are
reduced to a minimum before the release and the rest of the activities, for
example, documentation, are carried out after the release has been made.

In an emergency, the following people can authorise a fix to be produced
without contacting the CS Release Manager:

« SSC Manager
« CS Operations Manager
e Problem Manager

If this happens, the person authorising the fix ensures that the CS
Release Manager is informed so that the release process can incorporate
the fix.

Where an emergency fix has been applied to get systems up and running,
release management processes may be applied retrospectively

6. If the RMF decides not to develop and release a fix, one of the following
actions takes place:

(a)The RMF decides that a live problem can wait until the next major
software release. In this case, the CSRM clones the call on the new
release and returns the call on PinICL to EDSC.

(b) If the original is not a live fault it is upversioned and returned to Gen
Dev.

(c) The RMF identifies the call as not being a problem at all, that is, the
perceived shortfall is the way the system was designed to work. RMF

FUJ00120446

Version: 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 29/01/01

returns the call to the originator so they can raise a change request for
an enhancement to the system

(d) If rejection is considered to have significant impact to the customer,
the CSRM escalates the problem to the Customer Satisfaction
Manager before authorising closure of the call

Note: Fourth line support PinlCLs include problems that are not in the current
live environment. These are not relevant to the release management process
and are managed by development. However, if a fourth line support PinICL
identifies a problem in the current release, the RMF decides whether or not to
postpone the fix.

Defining the release plan and time scales

Once the decision has been made to create a fix; the following issues may
need to be taken into account.

1. Any dependencies between calls

2. Any situations where a new release will run in parallel to an old release
before the old release is upgraded.

3. The priority of each fix according the different needs of each CS unit.

4. CSRM updates the report for POCL, for which they are currently
responsible, with the expected completion date to resolve the call

5. For most releases, the delivery date is not significant. The release is
simply distributed at the earliest convenient time. For releases that have
a significant date line, the following steps are taken:

e Each unit involved in the release provides details of the time scales in
which they can complete the required work

e All parties involved agree to a high-level plan for each release

The CSRM is responsible for determining the availability of the
Operational Test Rig. and co-ordinating the allocation of users to it.

6. The CSRM:
(a) Creates a software fix release note

(b) Captures all the information and raises a release PinICL for each
release.

The Release PinlCL references all the PinICL calls (or HSH / SMC
calls) that it covers and each original PinICL call is updated with the
new Release PinICL number. Progress queries on the original
PinlCL calls are found by reference to the software fix release note
attached to the new Release PinICL

(c) Attaches the release note to the PinICL and sends it to PIT

7. The manager for each unit updates the release PinICL with details of their
progress

8. The CSRM monitors the progress of the software fix release note by
accessing the release PinlICL and manages any deviations from the high-

level plan to ensure that all units are aware of the delay and the impact
can be minimised. The CSRM does this by negotiation with the different
units in the release process both in and outside of the RMF.

If necessary, the CSRM escalates problems to Service Management
Notes:
1. The CSRM owns the plan
2. Arelease PinlCL is a different kind of PinICL to those used by SSC so
that it is not counted in problem statistics
Managing the delivery of supporting services
See Appendix A.5 process diagram

Other units may be involved in the release process who are not part of the
normal RMF, for example, training, helpdesks, documentation, bench-
marking, hardware installation. In most cases fixes will not affect these units,
but, if any of these units are involved, the CSRM co-ordinates their activities,
identifying any testing requirements and receiving notification from the units
when their preparation are complete, as follows:

e For HSH and SMC: notification of operational readiness

e For documentation: notification of completion of update, and the
documentation itself, so that CSRM can distribute it

e For hardware: notification of operational readiness.

e For user training: notification that the training material is ready, trials of
the material are scheduled on the Operational Test Rig, training is
delivered where necessary

Provided that all the supporting preparation is complete, CSRM sign off the
release note.

Note that the time taken for the distribution of the documentation has to be
taken into account in the delivery schedule of the release.

Most fixes do not normally affect any of these other units.

Creating the software fix

Fourth line support creates the fix and the Tivoli installation scripts, and unit
tests and documents the fix. Any fixes that fail testing must be recreated.

ICL Pathway development complete the release note with details, such as the
affected estate, and send it via PinlICL to Configuration Management. If
external fourth line support are involved, ICL Pathway development manage
them and complete the release note on their behalf.

Re-raising a release note

A software fix could fail in OTT or it could be applied in the wrong way. When
a failed fix is investigated and the content of the release is found to be at
fault, then one or more new work-packages are developed. CSRM withdraw

FUJ00120446
FUJ00120446

Version: 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 29/01/01

the original software fix release note and raise a new one to cover the new
work-package(s).

Information about the new work-packages is typed into the existing PinICL as
a new progress commentary. The associated PinICL record in the Release
Management database is amended by the adding a suffix letter, starting with
‘a’ to the record name. For example the record name PC0001589a indicates
that the initial fix associated with PinICL PC0001589a has failed and that a
new one needs to be delivered.

6.1.6 Authorising the software fix
The CSRM authorises the software fix release, having:

1. Ensured that all testing and preparation is complete
2. All sign offs have been attained.

6.1.7 Completing the release process

1. Either OSD/SMC or OSD Service Management distributes software. After
the software has been distributed, CSRM receive notification of the
success or otherwise of the release:

e If OSD/SMC or OSD Service Management confirm the successful
release of the software, CSRM receive the release PinICL from CM. If
the delivery was only to the pilot estate, which may be the case for
high risk fixes, CSRM authorise the full delivery to go ahead

e If the distributing unit report problems with the distributed software,
CSRM may authorise the regression of the release. (Regression
means withdrawing the software fix that had been installed)

2. Provided that the release is successful, CSRM sign off the release note
as complete. CSRM then close the release PinICL.

6.1.8 Work Instructions

A set of work instructions complement the processes above. They are held on
the Customer Service V drive with an index at v:ReleaseMgt\CSRM Working
Documents\DocPlan_Index_1

6.1.9 Software Distribution Service Review

A review is held on a monthly basis with the unit providing the software
distribution service.

7 Business continuity

The Pathway CS Support Services Manager is responsible for ensuring that a
business recovery plan is in place for the SSC. See Appendix C for details.

ICL Pathway SSC Operational Correction Request
Process

The SSC has access to the live system which can be used to correct data on the system when this has been corrupted in
some way.

The correction originator must —

i) Complete an OCR form for every correction to data on the live system.

This can be done by anyone within ICL Pathway, but is normally completed by the Duty Manager, other Problem
Manager or Business Support Manager when an incident or problem has been caused by an error in the data. It can
also be completed by SSC staff members who, in the course of diagnosing a fault detect that the data in the system
has become corrupted.

ii) Email the OCR form to an authorizer, electronically signing it where possible, and where this is not possible, telephoning the authorizer to

ii)

il)

ili)

iv)

vy)

vi)

vil)

confirm that the OCR is being sent.

The correction authorizer must be one of the following -

* Duty Manager
+ Business Support Manager
+ CS Operations Manager
* SSC Manager

« Release Manager
The correction authorizer will

Authorize the correction, or report back to the originator to specify why the correction is not being authorized

Forward the OCR form to the SSC electronically with an encrypted electronic signature file.

The SSC staff member who is to perform the correction will

check the electronic signature of the authorizer before proceeding
Store the OCR form and the signature file in the “received OCRs"” section on the SSC server

Wherever possible, produce a script to make the data correction, and test this on the SSC reference rig prior to it running
on the live system. Sections in the OCR form confirm whether or not this has been done.

Prior to the correction being made, document the state of the affected part of the system on the OCR form.

Prior to the correction being done, complete on the OCR form the regression path details. If no regression path is
possible, then this must be stated

When corrections are to be made to the live system, at least two people must be in attendance. This will normally be SSC
staff, but can be one SSC staff member and one person from the 4" line support unit responsible for the relevant area in
which the data correction will take place, or one SSC staff member and one OSD staff member.

(On completion of the data correction, document the state of the affected part of the system and mail an electronically
signed copy of the OCR form to the “witness”. The witness will then also electronically sign the form and email it to either
the SSC manager or the SSC web site controller.

10 AppendixC SSC Business Recovery Plan

10.1 Section 1 ICL Pathway Generic

10.1.1 Introduction

This appendix provides instructions for staff working for ICL Pathway SSC on
how to respond to a major incident affecting the building at BRA01,
personnel, assets or the business.

The SSC is responsible for the safekeeping and communication of the
business continuity plan within the team.

This plan has been developed to ensure that Pathway can recover from a
major disruption in a timely and efficient manner. However, the existence of
this plan alone does not guarantee a successful recovery. This plan must be
kept current as personnel, equipment, facilities, and business processes
change. The participants in the recovery process must know and understand
their roles in the execution of the plan. Physical and information
environments on which the plan depends must be monitored to ensure that
they are being maintained and are available for recovery if needed.
Furthermore, the plan must be tested regularly for validity.

10.1.2 Objectives
The primary objectives of the SSC business continuity plan are:

e to provide a tested vehicle which, when executed, will permit an efficient,
timely resumption of all critical business functions in order to continue
operations

e to contain, within acceptable levels, the financial and operational impacts
that Pathway could suffer following a disruption

e to minimise impacts upon customers
«e To minimise the impact to the public and to the industry image of Pathway

10.1.3 Scope

This plan provides for recovery of the SSC operations within one working day
of a disruption.

The plan covers:

rebuild of critical equipment

10.1.4 Assumptions
The Plan has been developed with the following assumptions:

.

.

correct data files are backed up and stored remotely
office IT at FELO1 will be available within 2 hours of invocation

all necessary critical records have been stored offsite and can be
recovered within two hours after an incident has been notified to the SSC
Manager or his deputy

10.1.5 Change Management

This plan will be reviewed regularly

10.1.5.1

Change Checklist

Changes that may affect the plan are:

.

.

SSC personnel and related details
critical business functions

third Parties providing support to the SSC
software

hardware

critical records.

10.1.6 Audit

Audit of the plan will be conducted according to the ICL Pathway Audits policy
and annual plan.

10.1.7 Testing

The plan will be reviewed once per annum or when significant organisation
changes take place. Any resulting plan changes will be collated and
incorporated into this document and the plan re-issued.

10.2 Section 2 SSC specific

10.2.1 Strategy explanation

In the event of a disaster affecting BRAO1 which is so severe that the existing
arrangements for UPS, backup generators etc are ineffective, that there is a
total building loss, then some SSC staff will move to FEL01.

SSC access PCs, which are used to access the live system, have been built
and will be maintained in a secure area in FELO1.

A room in FELO1 which has been set up with the required firewall and
connections to the live service will be used, and SSC staff will connect their
own PCs into the available sockets.

OSD staff will be required during this process as a final check on the
connections to the live system through routers and firewalls.

SSC maintains all essential data on the SSC web site, off site copies of which
are held by both the senior technician and the SSC manager. These copies
will be used if necessary to recover the web site, which contains diagnostic
information, including Known Error Logs.

10.2.2 Pre-disaster Actions

1. Ensure that the essential documentation on the SSC web site is correctly
backed-up, and that off-site copies are maintained.

2. Ensure that essential equipment is lodged at the backup site (FELO1) ina
secure area

3. Ensure that the essential SSC staff who will travel to FELO1 in the event of
an emergency have access to the site, and to the secure area where the
kit is maintained.

4. Ensure that OSD have installed, and are maintaining the required
communications connections from the backup site to the live estate.
