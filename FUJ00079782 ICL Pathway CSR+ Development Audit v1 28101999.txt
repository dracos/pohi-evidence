Introductiow

The audit forms part of the 1999 programme of planned Internal Audits into
aspects of ICL Pathway’s organisation and activities. It presents an update to
the findings of the NR2 Mid Stage Quality Audits undertaken between
December 1997 and May 1998.

Originally planned as four separate audits to take place during Qi & Qz2 of 1999,
the CSR+ MSQAs were amalgamated and delayed to Q3 to accommodate the
re-organisation of the Development Directorate that took place during May.

The main aim of the audit was to provide assurance to Pathway Management
about the status of the CSR+ design, development and testing activities,
principally within the Development Directorate. Principally a review of process
and compliance it also considered management processes, including
communication, organisation and resource planning and includes a review of
the status and deployment of the corrective actions that emerged from the
previous NR2 (CSR) Mid Stage Quality Audit.

As the audit progressed it became clear that some avenues of enquiry led
beyond the Development Directorate and some findings and recommendations
reflect this scope extension.

Scope & Conduct

Audit Scope

The scope of the audit was defined in Terms of Reference that were distributed
to interested parties on 8" September 1999. These are attached at Annex A to
the report.

Audit Conduct

The audit was conducted on various dates between 8‘ September and 7"
October 1999 by Jan Holmes and Ian Honnor from Quality & Risk.

The May re-organisation introduced the concept of parallel Delivery Units
within Development, each containing teams addressing specific product design,
development and system testing. Delivery Unit Managers were interviewed to
gain an understanding of their organisation, scope of work and methods
employed. These were followed by interviews at Team Leader level in both
development and system test areas. B&TC Team Leaders were also interviewed
resulting in some 35 interviews taking place over a four week period. The larger

than anticipated number of interviews has had two detrimental affects on the
audit timetable :

a. The production of the draft report was delayed by two weeks.

b. Some areas have not been completely addressed at the time of final
report publication.

In particular the report does not cover the OSD Dublin audit nor does it cover
the System Testing groups. Supplementary reports will be produced.

Acknowledgement

There never is a good time to conduct a wide ranging audit such as this and
Acceptance pressures during September exacerbated an already tight
Development schedule. Both Ian and I enjoyed total support and co-operation
during the audit and for that we wish to record our appreciation.

Report Maiw Body Structure

The remainder of this report is structured as follows :

Section 3 provides a management summary that draws together the main
findings of the audit. While it can be read in isolation it can only provide an
overview and does not necessarily reflect the totality of recommendations
made.

Section 4 is a detailed analysis of the Delivery Units, down to product team
level, and identifies what was found during the audit. It, and the associated
Working Papers - not presented in the report - provide the evidence for the
recommendations made.

Section 5 presents findings and recommendations in areas not directly related
to any specific Delivery Unit team.

Next Steps

During w/c 8 November I shall be putting together the Corrective Action Plan
(CAP) and discussing with the relevant Directors and Managers the actions to
be put in place to address the recommendations. Note that at this stage
recommendations can be challenged and those challenges will be reflected in
the CAP.

Once completed the CAP will be presented to the Pathway Audit Committee
(PAC) [*] for ratification. (The concept of the PAC is being piloted on this audit
and, if successful, will become the model for future post audit activity).

Progress of the CAP will be monitored during the coming weeks and months
and reported to the PAC at regular intervals.

3B Management Summary

3.1 Overall Auessment

3.1 In talking to members of the Management Team prior to commencing the field

3.1.2

work it was clear that they wanted assurances that things had improved since
NR2, that the CSR+ Release was being developed in a more controlled manner,
and that they could expect a more stable, resilient product as a result. It is
therefore pleasing to report that, notwithstanding the detailed observations and
recommendations made in this report, there is an overall improvement in the
application of process, review and standards to the CSR+ products. These can
be summarised as follows :

Appropriate documentation has, to a great extent, been developed at the
right time in the lifecycle.

Informal reviews of content have been conducted, at best by email comment
cycle.

Informal code reviews have been conducted between Developers and Team
Leaders.

Unit and link testing has been conducted, although this ranges from
informal to rigorous.

The most significant change has been in the attitude of the Team Leaders
interviewed where all expressed a personal interest and desire to improve
things and ‘do it right’. This is a marked change to NR2 where Team Leaders
were under too much pressure to even think about doing it right, just
delivering.

However, the following balancing factors have to be applied :

The documentation produced, particularly at the lower level of detail (LLDs,
Test Scripts), are not consistently developed against the Online Standard
templates.

Email comment cycles alone are not suitable vehicles for document reviews.
They are usually limited to reviews of content, not the application of design
principles or a rigorous end-to-end review of the design against
requirements. Moreover, participation by selected reviewers is not
mandatory. Some Team Leaders asserted that theses had been carried out
but there was no evidence to support these claims.

There are no underpinning standards for C or VB code, the primary
languages used. Many Team Leaders imposed standards based on their own
examples of best practice and applied these when conducting reviews. The
remains, however, no universal standard in use across the programme

although work is currently underway to address this shortfall, With the
exceptions of RODB and Security there is no evidence of these reviews
taking pace.

¢ The unit and link testing approach was variable. Some teams had conducted
full regression testing while another had tested only the CSR+ changes -
although plans were in place to develop regression scripts and subsequently
exercise them. Others had undertaken very informal testing without the
benefit of scripting.

Details can be found in the main body of the report.

Retrospective Work

A number of the Development Teams have identified incomplete elements of
documentation, especially Low Level Designs and Unit and Link Test
documents. Some had already identified work to remedy these shortcomings
and were prepared (and preparing) to develop missing documentation from
earlier baselines to improve the situation for future Releases.

This retrospective work should be supported by the organisation and should be
taken into account in any resource planning that may be underway. However, it
must be planned and I recommend that Delivery Unit Managers are tasked with
developing ‘Get Well Plans’ for their retrospective units to deal with the missing
or incomplete deliverables.

Inconsistent Work Practices and Documentation

Scrutiny of the detailed report shows that there are differences in the way that
development teams operate and inconsistency in the work products that they
produce. There is still a general lack of awareness of the Online Standards and
the depth and richness of guidance that is available there. Work carried out by
the CSE during June and July identified the degree of use (and non-use) by
development teams, although the justification for not using them has not been
explored to any extent.

The consolidated audit report from the NR2 MSQAs [5] identified concerns
around awareness and deployment of the Online Standards but omitted to
make any concrete recommendations as to how to improve either. The audit
has identified a considerable change in attitude within the delivery units
although there remains the challenge of delivery schedules to be met and a
general lack of awareness of the Online Standards.

The current work to convert the existing helpfile OLS to a full intranet provides
an ideal opportunity to re-launch them and I recommend that an awareness
programme is launched to overcome the apparent lack of knowledge of the
coverage and content of the OLS. This must be backed up with effective
management checks ensuring that the key controls are exercised.

Evidence

One of the key areas considered during the audit was the existence of evidence
to support the development lifecycle. Evidence of work done is a vital
component of ISO registration which can be crudely broken down into ‘Say
what you're going to do; do it, now prove it’. This is obviously a gross over
simplification but evidence lies at the core of the registration process. Verbal
assurances that such a review has taken place, or that this testing happened,
however honest and truthful represent anecdotal evidence at best and this
would not be acceptable to an ISO Assessor.

There was an abundance of verbal assurances that lifecycle reviews had taken
place but very little hard evidence, in the form of walkthrough notes, document
comment sheets, review meeting minutes, etc existed. Having moved from the
NRz position where even anecdotal evidence was hard to find Pathway must now
formalise the documenting and retention of review outcomes. Not only does this
provide evidence of review but can also be used to measure the effectiveness of the
review process itself, an important element of continuous process improvement.

Release Management

Although covered in the detailed report this is discussed here since it is the core
process that drives the Pathway business outside Operations and the immediate
Roll Out activities. Following the 18‘ August ratification of the process the
failure to appoint a Project Manager to implement and deploy it across the
programme has meant that at least 2 months of potential benefit to CSR+ has
been lost.

The appointment of a Project Manager to implement and deploy the Release
Management process should be made at the earliest opportunity.

3.6 Review of NR2 MSQA

3.6.1 The results of the NR2 MSQAs are presented at Section 6. Although
considerable effort and expense had been put into certain of the
recommendations, eg the OPENframework Initiative, it has been difficult to
establish if any benefit accrued from that work. The work currently underway
to produce a comprehensive Non Functional Requirements Catalogue suggests
that the changes to the OLS documentation templates made following this
initiative did not bring about the required outcome.

3.6.2. Many of the minor issues around documentation naming and numbering

conventions remain although some of the ‘bigger issues’, eg improving the test
environments available to unit and link testing have been achieved. As
identified in the Overall Assessment there have been considerable
improvements in the production of low level documentation and unit and link
testing, both areas previously identified as major weaknesses.

4 Detailed Findings - Development Unit Teamy

This section of the report presents the detailed findings of the audit based on
interviews with Development Unit Team Leaders and scrutiny of available
documentation. It is organised by Development Unit teams and allows
management to consider the variances in approach where these occur.

Release 17 of the Pathway Online Standards were used as a basis for the
compliance element of the audit.

There are a number of recommendations that emerge that apply, in whole or in
part, to all Delivery Units.

4.1 POCL Products

4.1.1 Automoted Payments Service

Commentary - APS Counter

The Counter element of APS has been completely re-written for CSR+. The
decision was taken before the re-organisation and was justified following an in-
depth review of the code when it was considered to be un-maintainable and
incapable of being enhanced to accommodate the new Smartcard functionality.
The approach taken was to reverse engineer a suite of Low Level Design
documents from the existing code, validate against the High Level Design and
re-code.

Documentation has been developed at all levels, compliant with existing
Pathway standards, and there is evidence of reviews having taken place through
the retention of earlier versions.

Commentary - APS Host

There is no evidence of reviews having taken place on Design documentation
but the Team Leader has asserted that a specific activity to review and apply the
QA Checklist criteria will be conducted during the system test support period.
It was not possible to trace any direct relationship between the unit test scripts
and modules and the Team Leader was only able to provide a broad estimate
(between 200 & 400) of scripts executed.

4.1.2 Logisticy Feeder Systew

LFS is a new product for CSR+ and was developed following the production of a
Business Requirements Document, originally signed in May 1998 but not finally
agreed until August 1999 following further negotiations.

Commentary - LFS Counter

Although code has been delivered the delivery and updating of supporting
documentation, and the associated reviews, were severely affected when the
LFS (Counter) team was reduced from 5 to 2 as a result of effort being re-
directed to EPOSS Acceptance and PinICL clearance, and staff resignation.

The Team Leader estimated that there was something in the region of 2 months
work to produce the work products currently missing.

A major concern in this area is the absence of formal unit and link test scripts,
again attributable to staff shortage.

Commentary — LFS Host

Other than evidence of reviews and instances of non compliance with
documentation standards, the level of management control in this area was
considered to be good.

4.2 POCL Infrostructure

4.2.1 Electronic Point of Sale Service

Commentary

From the CSR+ perspective the development of the EPOSS product has been
successful with software drops being made according to planned schedules and
confidence in the team that future drops will also be achieved on time.

Unfortunately EPOSS continues to be resource hungry in dealing with live
problems associated with CSR and in ensuring that these fixes are brought
forward and incorporated into the CSR+ product.

The EPOSS Task Force Report [6] raised the question of the maintainability and
resilience of the EPOSS code following the 6 week PinICL blitz where some 550
PinICLs were processed. Since then a further ~996 PinICLs have been raised -
using the ‘Product = EPOSS and Target Release = IR-CSR or PDR-CSR’ search
criteria - and these can only have had a detrimental effect on the quality of the
code. In particular the maintainability, resilience and potential for change
aspects must be subject to doubt. The report also identified many instances of
poor programming technique and application of coding standards and while
CSR+ changes have been reviewed by the Team Leader no attempts have been
made to address the significant body of code not affected. There is also
anecdotal evidence that EPOSS components used by other applications are
fragile and cause problems for the calling application, Print Server was
mentioned by both LFS and APS Counter teams.

To further support the recommendation statistics on EPOSS & Desktop PinICLs
raised sine 1stOctober 1998 were obtained. The selection criteria used were :

Release = NR2 or CSR; From 1/10/98 to 28/10/99; Product Group = EPOSS &
DeskTop; Product = EPOSS

The figures indicate that the problems facing EPOSS during the Task Force
period have not diminished. Of greater concern are the non-EPOSS PinICLs
within the group suggesting that there are still serious quality problems in this
vital, customer facing element of the system.

The EPOSS Solutions Report [7] made specific recommendations to consider the
re-design and re-write of EPOSS, in part or in whole, to address the then known
shortcomings. In light of the continued evidence of poor product quality these
recommendations should be re-considered.

4.2.2 Reference Data Management Centre/RDDS

Commentary

In common with some other areas the Team Leader has a planned action to
review both CSR+ and CSR documentation during October and November.

A particular concern in this area is the complete absence of any formal unit
and/or link testing strategies, plans or scripts. Given reference data’s central
role in the successful operation of the system this, of all areas, should be subject
to rigorous and formal testing.

Effort should be expended, as soon as practicable, into developing a full suite of
unit and/or link test scripts, and a formal test strategy for future releases of

RDMC/RDDS should be established.

Commentary

Generally, this area was felt to be well controlled. The scope of unit testing was
limited to the CSR+ changes, due mainly to the absence of any CSR test
documentation and the Team Leader has accepted an activity to develop a full
suite of unit test scripts to enable full regression testing and improve testing for
future releases. The absence of test documentation is common to other areas
and this retrospective work is being commended to others in a similar position.

4.5 Security

Commentary

There are three security products being developed for CSR+, the Key
Management System (KMS), Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and Secure Build.
Both KMS and VPN are new for CSR+.

The products were originally being developed by A&TC under a development
contract with ICL Pathway and a Pathway Project Manager, and commenced as
a PRINCE based project producing a Project Initiation Document that
identified the organisational, resource and procedural controls that would be
applied to the development. It also identified the documentation structure that
would be delivered and the quality control activities that would be present in
the lifecycle.

Following the re-organisation the project came completely within the control of
Pathway and a revised Roles and Responsibilities document produced to reflect
the changes. The Unit enjoys the services of a dedicated Project Control Officer,
with the full agreement of the Programme Office and this has resulted in a Plan
that is, in the opinion of the Project manager, more detailed and flexible than
that enjoyed by his peers.

The pervasive nature of this development demands the highest level of
management control and the evidence presented during the audit, albeit not
exhaustively tested, suggests that this control is present and being exercised.

Detailed Findings — Other Areas

Functional Requirementy Capture

A considerable amount of effort was expended into ensuring that where
feasible, CSR+ requirements were captured, understood, documented and
approved prior to the commencement of work. Requirements workshops were
held during 1998 for a number of discrete areas and Requirement catalogues
produced. In POCL Infrastructure an extra Requirements Summary was
developed to accommodate the central role of Reference Data and _ its
relationship with EPOSS, the objective being to eliminate any overlap of the
separate areas and ensure that there were no gaps between them. These were
presented to the Management Team and ratified for inclusion into the Release
Content Definition.

A Release Content Definition has been compiled although its status as the
definitive description has not yet been assured through approval by POCL. If
the CSR example is anything to go by it is highly unlikely that any formal
approval will be obtained prior to the Release being implemented.

Unfortunately, any stability in the requirements baseline is fast being eroded by
the continual stream of CPs being received for CSR+ and those for CSR which
will have to be carried forward. Between June 4" and October 15‘ 126 CPs were
processed by Change Management for CSR and 88 for CSR+. This problem was
further exacerbated during Acceptance when concessions were given during the
negotiations I understand that further concessions have been offered during the
recent CSR+ re-planning exercise. The current re-plan takes into account all
known concessions (in the form of CRs raised by POCL and CPs raised by
Pathway) and an aggressive delivery date has been arrived at.

The proposed Release Management process (see para 5.11) identifies the concept
of a fixed size requirements ‘bucket’ once a delivery and resource schedule has
been established. Changes to the ‘bucket’ has to be time and resource neutral
insofar that requirements added must be balanced by others being sacrificed.
However, the principle cannot be implemented until such time as the process is
deployed across the programme.

In order to protect the revised delivery date it is imperative that no further
changes are accepted to the CSR+ requirements baseline and I recommend that
the principles enshrined in the Release Management process be applied to the
current CSR+ requirements baseline.

5.3

A Non Functional Requirements Catalogue had been developed by B&TC
during 1999. This was based on an earlier 1996 NFR document, itself derived
from the Business Portfolio and other documents that related to the original
contract. Its delivery to the TDA identified that a revised NFR catalogue, that
reflected the revised contract, needed to be developed. An action has now been
accepted to produce a revised NFR Catalogue based on the revised contract and
work is currently underway within the TDA to deliver this document.

At the same time, B&TC already have a number of test scripts for NFRs, some
based on the Technical Test Register, an inheritance from NR2 Technical
Testing, and some carried forward directly from NRz testing activity. The extent
to which these scripts relate to or map onto the requirements currently being
collated within the TDA is not clear.

Following the Programme Plan revision, there will be a 25% increased in the
user population at the point of CSR+ Release Approval as follows:

e Plan V8.0 : RAB Approval 26/05/00 : Outlets live ~8,500
e Plan Vg.o : RAB Approval 25/08/00 : Outlets live ~10,680

By December 2000, when PONU’s busy season starts, some 15,000 outlets are
forecast to be live and a high level of assurance that the NFRs, in particular
those that relate to systems performance and capacity, is essential.

The design and development work for CSR+ is largely complete. B&TC’s proposed
testing of NFRs is currently based on old, potentially superseded requirements
although the delivery a revised NFR Catalogue is imminent. It is imperative that
the existing scripts are validated against the NFRs in the new Catalogue at the
earliest opportunity.

There is am implied risk that the NFR Catalogue may highlight deficiencies in the
CSR+ products delivered that will require re-work.

Security Management Requivementy

The Requirements authority for KMS is QRM, who also are one of the prime
users.

It was noted that :

¢ There is an informal agreement between QRM and Secure Development for a
User Acceptance Test to be conducted by QRM during February 2000. There
is no evidence that this agreement is supported by a committed, resourced
plan in QRM.

e The size of the KMS user role within QRM is not yet determined - though
the additional head count requirement is small (possibly one person full
time).

¢ There is uncertainty whether the current contracts with OSD include the
operational services expected to be provided by them in operating the KMS.

The agreements and commitments to conduct the KMS User Acceptance Tests
should be formalised and reflected in the Security Manager's workplan for 2000.

At NR2 there was a jointly agreed approach to penetration testing which was
frustrated by a lack of hardware resource. There remains an expectation on
both sides of the Agreement that Penetration Testing will be performed for
CSR+ in or about the 1 Quarter of 2000 although there is no committed
ownership and plan that supports this activity.

Assuming that the requirement for penetration testing remains the approach
agreed for NR2 should be reviewed for continued suitability. Ownership of the
activity should be assigned and the necessary resources committed and reflected
in the Programme Plan.

Ruk Management

A new Risk Management process is currently being developed using the Predict!
tool at its core. To this end Delivery Managers had been asked to develop Risk
Registers appropriate to their areas and make this information available to the
Pathway Risk Manager. The formats of the various Registers are not consistent
although this should not present a problem given that all information will be
input to the tool and will emerge in a standard format for future use. The Risk
Manager has also developed a manual register format, consistent with the
Predict! format for those areas that would not benefit from using the tool
directly.

It was noted that difficulties are being experienced in the integration of the
Predict! Tool with the AMS planning tool. While maintaining full integration as
the ultimate goal the Risk Manager should not delay in introducing the revised
RM process across the programme.

It was noted that at least one other Risk Register was in common use across the
Programme. This is maintained by the Director, Quality and Risk Management
and is used by him to monitor ‘high level risks’ with members of the
Management Team and senior managers. Once the Predict! Risk Management

tool has been implemented there is no benefit to maintaining a separate and
parallel register. Duplication of effort to review and maintain separate registers,
and inconsistent analysis and measurement methods compromises the integrity
of the Predict! based process and the benefits that should accrue from a single
programme wide approach to risk management.

It is anticipated that the Predict! register will form the sole repository and source
of risk information, providing a common and consistent view of risk, and the use
of all other registers, lists and matrices should cease once this has been fully
implemented.

Scrutiny of the available risk registers shows that Migration and related issues
figure highly in Delivery Unit Manager's minds. The proposed Release
Management process assigns specific responsibilities to the B&TC Release
Manager in the area of migration and early visibility and deployment of that
process may address some of the concerns expressed by the DMs.

Para 5. addresses the lack of management action in appointing a Project
Manager to implement and deploy the proposed Release Management process.

As an entirely independent initiative the Programme Office have generated
their own risk register that plays into the Quality Improvement Plans
(identified in para 5.9) and the underlying requirements of ISOgoo1 (see para
5.10), It is interesting to note that without exception the risks identified on the
PO risk register have their basis in development lifecycle and project
management activities, whereas the risks on the Delivery Units are almost
without exception business and time based.

The risks identified on the PO risk register apply in whole or in part to all
Delivery Units. In order to ensure that Delivery Managers and Team Leaders
address the detail of these risks they should be incorporated into each DU'’s risk
register and the risks managed alongside those already identified.

Planning Procesy

During the audit a number of observations were raised, particularly at Team
Leader level, about the current planning process and the provision of ‘actuals’
via the TARs. Their concerns were in the following areas :

¢ The plans that they were originally presented with by the Programme Office
bore little comparison to their individual work plans which they originally
submitted.

« Because the plans were baselined they were unable to change the plan
details other than adding new activities via the TAR.

¢ As time went by the plans moved further away from what was actually
happening on the shop floor and as a result became less useful to the Team
Leaders in their day to day management of activities. Some have reverted to
maintaining their own individual work schedules to cater for this deficiency.

¢ Poor return rate of updated plans in exchange for completed TARs.

« There is a view that the plans as they stand are being maintained for
management reporting purposes and not to help Team Leaders in their daily
duties.

From the audit perspective the main concern in the unnecessary duplication of
effort in maintaining multiple and informal plans and schedules. There is also a
question over the basis of review between Delivery Manager and Team Leader,
especially when this review informs management on progress through weekly
reports.

I understand that there is a review already underway into the planning process
and I do not propose to pursue this further in this audit. [Note : It was pointed
out during the draft report that this review would not address the issues
identified above - the recommendation has been changed as a result].

For the Planning Process to be accepted and used positively by the Team Leaders
it is imperative that it meets their needs as well as management’s. I recommend
that a full review is carried out of the Planning Process that confirms or refutes
the concerns raised by the Team Leaders and establishes a process that is
acceptable to, and used by, all interested parties.

Procesy & Standards

Following the reorganisation of Development the responsibility for the
maintenance and development of the Pathway Online Standards passed to the
Chief Software Engineer (CSE). The approach taken was to consider process
development from the tactical - what can we do for CSR+ - and the strategic -
what must Pathway do to conform with the overall ICL requirements -
perspectives. Tactically, the decision was to transfer the ascertain the degree of
compliance in the Delivery Units, transfer the OLS from the existing helpfile
technology to an intranet and then re-launch them during CSR+ timescales.
Unfortunately the task was more complex than originally thought, progress has
not been as rapid as anticipated, and the intranet site is unlikely to be rolled out
before the end of the month.

The CSE is part of the Technical Design Authority (TDA) and in a scoping
document declared that non Development Directorate areas of responsibility
and activity were explicitly outside. However, the scope of the original OLS
extended beyond Development and included programme wide processes, eg

Document Management and Change Management. Not to include these areas
at this stage would, in my opinion, be retrograde and leave a potential hole in
the Pathway wide deployment of processes. Other areas of Pathway are
developing and implementing their processes in an entirely discrete manner
and this could result in problems, especially at the interfaces between
departments, and could ultimately mitigate against Pathway’s ability to obtain
certification to ISOgoo1.

In Section 5.10 there is a recommendation that a Project Manager is appointed
to manage the ISO Certification exercise.

To have any chance of success I believe that a similar singular resource should be
appointed to take overall responsibility for the co-ordination of process
development and deployment across the whole of Pathway and that this resource
and the ISO Project Manager should be organisationally co-located.

In Section 4.2 the audit described how the APS Counter application had been
re-coded to deal with serious weaknesses in code quality identified by the
incoming development team. Under normal circumstances this would be a
sensible and practical response to an untenable situation. Unfortunately the
absence of effective development standards in Counter development, coupled
with the absence of appropriate technical review, has resulted in an
implementation that does not function or operate as effectively as it should.
This is resulting in rework.

The Host Application Database Design and Interface Standards were developed
to provide definitive technical standards for host development teams. Arguably
out of date since it deals specifically with Oracle development, there are no
known equivalents for Counter or Agent Development. I recommend that the
HADDIS is updated to reflect the current host development environments and the
equivalents for Counter and Agent development be produced.

It was also noted that there was no established coding standard for C or Visual
Basic, the principal programming languages used. A number of Team Leaders
had established de facto standards within their teams and had, to some extent,
shared this around with other teams.

However, to improve coding quality and ensure a consistent basis for code review
coding standards for C and VB must be developed and deployed via the Intranet
OLS. These standards should then be used.

CSR+ Documentation

The NR2 Design MSQA identified a number of problems with documentation
numbers, baselines and identification although at that time it was almost
impossible to quantify the scale. The Programme Office generates and
distributes a weekly Documentation Status Report to senior management in the
Development Directorate. The report indicates the current status of CSR (NR2)
and CSR+ documents, whether they are registered and present in PVCS and
whether they are approved or not.

Scrutiny of the latest issue of the Report shows that the number of documents
expected to be generated for CSR+ by Pathway is ~346. That there are only 107
registered in PVCS and 46 approved suggests that significant effort has to be
expended to register, develop, review and approve the expected suite. However,
the total number of documents expected may be overstated since the CSR+
worksets include products that are not being delivered by CSR+, for example,
worksets exist for Common Charging System (CCS) and Fraud Risk
Management Service (FRMS). Equally there is the possibility that the content of
worksets may have changed since first agreed earlier this year.

The Programme Office has instigated a review of CSR+ worksets that has
already resulted in the removal of some 440 documents.

Release 17 of the OLS introduced a revised documentation lifecycle including
the concept of worksets and defined the responsibilities of workset owners in
the continuing review of workset content.

In order to present a more accurate reflection of CSR+ documentation status,
thus improving the reporting to and monitoring of this by management, two
review cycles should be undertaken/completed :

a The Programme Office should complete their review the totality of the
PVCS documentation worksets for CSR+.

b. Workset owners should review their worksets and confirm the current
content or provide details of changes to the Programme Office.

CSR Documentation

The position at CSR+ is of nothing compared to that of CSR. Scrutiny of the
Documentation Activity Report for 22"4 October 1999 indicates that there are
1,643 documents identified in documentation worksets as being potentially
deliverable for CSR. Of these, 1,027 are to be generated by Pathway and 616 by
3° parties (NB. there may be some movement between these number but not a

The size of this task is significant and should be included within the proposed ‘Get
Well Plans’ identified in 3.2. In order to size the job the Programme Office should
undertake a review of the worksets to ensure that they are all required and
workset owners should review their content to confirm their accuracy, as
required in Documentation Management, OLS Release 17.

Quelity Improvement Initiatiey

A number of strategic appointments were made during 1999. One of these was
an external consultant into the Programme Office as a Quality Assurance
Manager. His role was to ensure that the quality and review processes
embedded in the existing delivery lifecycle processes were in use and effective
and to achieve a PinICL reduction for CSR+. He was also asked to review the
existing processes and to present Team his findings and recommendations for
the future to the recently formed Development Li Management Team.

He also developed two Quality Improvement Plans; one short term that
addressed CSR+ and one long term that looked to Release 3 and beyond. Both
of these were presented to the Development Director in early August 1999
seeking approval to proceed. To date no formal approval has been given and
consequently the initiative has stalled with many of the benefits of the QIP
being lost or compromised as a result.

The audit identified a number of elements of the CSR+ QIP that are being
progressed but these are as a result of individual Team Leader actions, outside a
managed programme of activities linked to the QIP, and not what was
originally envisaged by the QAM when putting the QIPs together. There is little
or no evidence to suggest that any of the long term improvements are being
actioned.

The Quality Assurance Manager should be given the authority to proceed with
the role that he was recruited to undertake. This will require the acceptance of,
and agreement to, the Quality Improvement Plans by the Development Director
and formal approval by him to proceed.

Following on from the production of the Quality Improvement Plans the QAM
was asked to prepare a separate report on the current status of the project
management and development lifecycle process within Development against
the requirements of ISOgo00-3, the TickIT interpretation of ISOgoo1. A
comprehensive report was produced and delivered to the Development
Director in August 1999. To date there has been no action to address the
weaknesses identified and this work has stalled. The report has not been widely

received a copy to assist him in his job of steering Pathway towards

This report provides a valuable insight into the state of Developments processes
and the weaknesses that exist. It should be given a wider circulation, especially to
the Pathway Quality Manager, and any corrective work identified should be
authorised.

During July a series of Quality Review Checklists were developed and
distributed to the Delivery Unit Managers. The objective of the exercise was for
Team Leaders to complete the Checklists for documents and code already
reviewed up to that time, and to continue to use the Checklists for other
reviews from that point forward. The information was to be used to ‘understand
the extent and nature of reviews conducted thus far on CSR+ and hence identify
areas of risk,’ [John Hemington memorandum 29/07/99].

It was accepted that the Checklists would only act as information gathering
vehicles since any benefit from carrying out design reviews is only achieved if
the review is conducted before coding starts.

The response has, to date, been poor and the analysis prepared by the Quality
Assurance Manager confirms the detailed findings presented earlier in this
report. As at 20" August the figures were :

POCL 2 ° ° ° All documents email review with
Products review criteria unknown.

During the audit the Development Director reminded the Delivery Unit
Managers of the requirement to complete these Checklists as they help to
establish a current position from which corrective work can be instigated. The
Resolution Plan for Acceptance Incident 298 establishes a series of corrective

actions to be put into place during CSR+ including the use of Checklists,
particularly for code. This is a commitment made to the customer and subject
to review by them to confirm that they have been applied.

Many of the Delivery Unit teams are planning retrospective review sessions for
their documents. This should be extended across all Units and the use of the
Checklists mandated during those reviews.

Formal quality planning for CSR+ was found to be virtually non-existent other
than review activities being included on the Plans delivered by the Programme
Office. The production of a Quality Plan, or at least a document that contains
the generally accepted elements of a Quality Plan, is a vital early step in project
planning and management. The Stage Management Plan defined in the OLS
provides much of the required detail and during early 1999 this was enhanced
by the QAM with the ultimate aim of having each Delivery Manager complete
one for their stream. The revised SMP was to be piloted within POCL
Infrastructure and although a draft plan was prepared it was not completed and
the concept was not rolled out to the other streams.

It is questionable whether there is any benefit in producing Quality Plans at this
stage of CSR+ development. However, the value of the document in bringing
together details of the resources, organisation, processes, reviews, risks,
assumptions and other contributory factors must be realised in future Release
and its production by Delivery Managers made mandatory.

5.10 ISOVOO1 Registration

5.10.1

Under the revised contractual agreements Pathway are obliged to have obtained
registration to ISOgo001 for the full scope of business 12 months after
Acceptance, i.e. by 24'* September 2000. The scope of business is deemed to
include :

¢ Software design, development and delivery services.

¢ Programme control and assurance services.

« Implementation services delivered through national Roll Out.

e Operations and operational support services.

e Customer services.

« Business development services including customer requirements.

¢ Organisational support including HR, IT infrastructure, etc.

Currently the responsibility for managing the attainment of registered firm
status rests with the Pathway Quality Manager, part of the Quality and Risk
Management Directorate.
5.10.2. The Quality Manager is currently looking after a number of other initiatives and

cannot give the time to this contractually binding work.

FUJ00079782
|J00079782

Having personally steered three separate companies through the rigours of ISO
9000 registration, including one to ISOgoo1/TickIT, I believe that the breadth of
scope of the proposed certification, and the time remaining in which to achieve it,
demands that a full time Project Manager is assigned to the task. Either the
Quality Manager should be able to transfer any non-essential initiatives or a
resource should be assigned to him specifically to manage the registration
commitment.

Notwithstanding the appointment of dedicated resource to drive this project, and
to assist when one is appointed, an activity should take place to produce an
inventory of all processes, developed or under development, and their deployment
status within Pathway. This activity should build on the work undertaken for
Development and the inventory mapped onto the requirements of ISOgoo1 to
identify shortcomings.

5.11 Release Management

5d

5.1.2

5.3

At the request of the Managing Director a considerable amount of work was
carried out during July and August to define and document a Pathway
programme-wide Release Management process. This was in response to
concerns that the re-organisation of Development had removed the ‘Release
Manager’ role and as a result there was lack of clarity as to how a Release was to
be populated, co-ordinated and made visible to the programme. In particular
the MD did not know who he should approach to obtain an overall picture of
progress.

On Thursday 18" August a presentation was made to members of the
Management Team where the proposed process was ratified and an action
placed on those attending to appoint a Project Manager to implement and
deploy the process across the programme. Speed was of the essence so that
CSR+ could take advantage of any controls and improvements that the revised
process might provide.

The audit found evidence where those elements of the process that would
benefit CSR+ directly have not been applied and as a result problems have
arisen :

e The introduction of the B&TC Acceptance Checklist by B&TC was achieved
without consulting the Delivery Unit Managers. This is a B&TC document

that provides a formal checkpoint from Development to B&TC and
agreement to its content and use is a pre-requisite to its acceptance by
Development.

« A key principle within Release Management is that the delivery of a Release
involves more than just Development and the delivery of software products.
Other parts of Pathway have to deliver their specific elements, including the
ability to support the Release in the field. This is particularly true where a
new product is being introduced and Customer Services may have to design
and develop a new support strategy. LFS is such a new product and the
auditor was unable to satisfy himself that appropriate actions were being
taken by CS in this area.

It is ten weeks since the August presentation and a Project Manager has not
been appointed. As a result there has not been any deployment action and any
benefit that might accrue to CSR+ is diminishing rapidly.

A Project Manager should be appointed without delay and he/she must
concentrate their initial efforts into identifying those areas that will benefit CSR+
and implementing them.

5.12 Intranet Development

5.12.1

5.12.2

There are at least five different Intranet developments currently underway in
Pathway. The ones that the auditors became aware of were :

« Architecture, including the online TED.
* Online Standards replacement site.

e Key Management development site.

¢ SSC tool support site.

¢ B&TC general information site

Each of these sites is being developed independently and each presents in an
entirely unique way.

Pathway Infrastructure have confirmed that there are no development
standards for Pathway intranet sites and that there is no formal strategy for
their use or deployment within the organisation. There can be no doubting the
value of using intranet technology to make information widely available to
others but the approach to development currently underway displayed lacks co-
ordination and is unlikely to obtain the best possible return for the effort
expended. There is the risk of duplication as evidenced by a section within the
B&TC site, not yet populated, that will provide details of processes that should
be published via the revised Online Standards. Support for these sites can also

become an issue if their exploitation rests entirely with an individual operating
independently rather than within a general development framework for this
type of output.

Pathway IT Infrastructure should established a policy and strategy for the
development and deployment of intranet sites within Pathway. It should also
conduct a review of existing activity, identify standards for their content and
presentation values, and ensure that future intranets developed for use within
Pathway conform to the strategy.

6 Review of NR2 MSQA Recommendations

6.1 Introduction

The (N)R2 Mid Stage Quality Audits (MSQA) were introduced at the request of
the Programme Director (MJBC) in October 1997. Their objectives were :

* To demonstrate to ICL Pathway’s Management Team that compliance with
standards and procedures had improved since Release 1.

e To demonstrate that the corrective actions put in place by ICL Pathway, in
response to the PA Consulting Programme Review Report, were being
carried out.

¢ To provide an assurance to the PDA that ICL Pathway was complying with
its own standards and procedures.

Four audits were planned, Design, Development, Technical Integration and
Test & Integration, and the audit programme concluded in June 1998 when a
‘Report of Reports’ was produced and the main points presented to the
Management Team.

6.2 Audit of Design

62.1 Summary of Findings

¢ Inconsistent application of document structures and contents.

¢ Inconsistent application of document titling and reference numbers.
e Difficulty in linking formal plans to documents or CPs.

¢ No document baselines or recognised groupings (sets).

Many of the audit findings were originally raised as early as February 1997.
6.2.2 Pathway Response

Two separate initiatives were put in place to address these problems. One,
which looked at document baselines, involved external consultancy from HPS
and contributed in the development of the Document and Change
Management processes and the PVCS CM tool to its current state. The other,
involved external consultancy from Openframework Consultancy, looked at
how some of the underlying principles of Openframework could be
incorporated into the emerging Pathway standards. Changes to the Pathway
OLS were made to bring some of the recommendations to bear.

6.2.3 Current View

The CSR+ audit has identified that issues of inconsistent documentation form
and content remains, particularly at Low Level Design. It would also be
extremely difficult to guarantee being able to identify what a particular
document was addressing simply by looking at its reference number.

6.3 Audit of Development

6.3.1 Summary of Finding,

e Effectiveness of unit and link testing.
¢ Protection of IPR contained in documentation and source code.
© No causal analysis of PinICLs.

e Sub-contractor control.
6.3.2 Pathway Response

Essentially there were two responses. The effectiveness of the unit and link test
procedures on Pathway Online Standards were reviewed and standards for
documentation introduced. In addition, procedures to manage 3" party
development were defined and introduced. Causal analysis for PinICLs was
introduced and is now available. A Metrics study was sponsored by the
Programme Office and a report produced and distributed during November
1998. Key recommendations have been extracted and either have been or are
currently being implemented.

6.3.3 Current View
Based on the evidence offered during this audit there has been a considerable
improvement in unit and link testing for CSR+. However, this must be balanced

against the lack of evidence offered to support the assertions, and the
differences between the product teams.

6.4 Audit of Technical Integration

6.4.1 Summary of Findingy

¢ No PIT handover Checklist.
e Improved PCMS status reporting and checking.
e Little or no analysis of failed (software) drops.

¢ Plans not linked (Development, TI and T&1), particularly Test Rig Plan.

6.4.2 Pathway Response

Checklist eventually introduced and in use. The analysis of drops was
incorporated into the Metrics study identified above. Plans were linked
although the test rig plan was considered too volatile so not included. PCMS
status check rejected in favour of per reviews.

6.4.3 Current View

As identified in the Section 2 : Scope & Conduct, TI was not included in the
audit.

6.5 Audit of Test & Integration

6.5.1 Summary of Findingy

¢ Relationship and linkage between T & I and Design.
© Coverage of TSC work and the (then) new ICL trading rules.

e Rework at system & integration test that should have been uncovered at
unit or link test.

¢ Improvements required in testing environments available to unit and link
testing if testing effectiveness is to be improved.

e One dimensional measures where only progress was measured to the
exclusion of others, eg. quality or resource utilisation.

6.5.2 Pathway Response

6.6

It was agreed that design reviews and reviews of test documentation would be
entered onto the NR2+ plan. The problems with the TSC were to do with agreed
scope and coverage or work that were addressed through a Gap Analysis Matrix.
Arguably the recent re-organisation of Development has contributed to
improvement in testing effectiveness by making improved test rig facilities
available to the earlier testing stages than previously was the case.

Conclusiow

The NR2 MSQA’s were introduced to address specific concerns raised by PDA
and PA. Almost all of the recommendations were accepted and in many cases
corrective actions put in place to address the shortcoming identified.

Where I believe Pathway has been less than successful is in addressing the
fundamental problems identified during the Design MSQA, that of baseline
management and gaining control over the masses of documentation being
developed in an uncontrolled manner. There is a continuing problem of
