Separation Project - Criminal Investigations
Policy for Post Office® Ltd

Project Objective
To develop & record a process map for the role of

criminal investigations policy within POL post
separation.

> Process maps that have now been prepared are as follows:

1. Investigation related courses

2. Research, interpretation, preparation, development and publication
of investigation procedures

3. Evaluation of criminal misconduct complaints and subsequent

internal investigations

4, Forensic examination of computers for investigation/prosecution

5. Safe Systems of Work (SSoW) and near miss evaluation

6. Tape recording, playback and copying machines

7. Copying of CCTV tapes for investigation/prosecution

>» The 2 areas below have been amalgamated onto a summary bullet point
sheet;

1. Almanac - Annual entry in Police & Constabulary Almanac will need
amending

2. Proceeds of Crime Act - Need to ensure that both RMG and POL are
scheduled under POCA.

>» The following area is under review within Section 5 of the Mails
Distribution Agreement (‘Investigations relating to POL Personnel’) ;

1. Operational Primacy - An MOU will need to be developed on
operational primacy in given situations, e.g. POL counter staff
stealing RM special deliveries.

Those process maps prepared include a description of the task, the
benefits to the business, (i.e. financial, legal, compliance. H&S or
otherwise). The process maps also include inputs (i.e. where does the
info come from, who do we need to liaise with, what forums do we attend,
what organisations must we join) and outputs, (what do we do with the
info, who do we send it to, how do they use it etc).

Project Phases

e Program plan prepared.

e Focus Group formed (Graham Ward (Lead), Paul Southin, Dave Posnett,
Helen Dickinson, Paul Whitaker

e Initial meeting with RMUK Investigation Team to identify RMUK,
contacts, Policies and Baton Passing requirements post separation.

¢ Format for Process maps agreed with POL stakeholders
