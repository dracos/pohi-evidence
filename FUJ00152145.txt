1. INTRODUCTION

This document specifies the software architecture proposed to satisfy
the requirements for the Fraud Case Management System stated in

(1], [2], (5).

1.1 SCOPE

This document covers the software components and logical structures
for the Pathway Fraud Case Management System. It excludes
hardware, contingency (disaster recovery) issues, networking — these
issues are to be covered in the Infrastructure Specification and Design
documents (TBA).

1.2 ASSUMPTIONS

This document makes the same base assumptions as given in [5], with

ft ificati Version: 1.1
Architecture Specification Date: 01/03/99

1.2.1

1.3

the following additions:

ACCURACY

As stated in [1], it is a requirement that the accuracy and integrity of
data from source systems is entirely the responsibility of the said
source system. Thus it is assumed that data will be accepted from
source systems at “face value” i.e. the Fraud Case management
System will not attempt to validate source data, or verify cross
references, in any way. The Fraud Case Management System’s
processing software will thus make the following assumptions:

1. Data that is accepted form the data warehouse will not need to be
validated.

1. Data that is accepted from CMS/PAS will not need to be validated.

DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

The remainder of this document is structured as follows:

¢ Architectural Overview
This section gives a high level overview of how the data warehouse
is constructed and operated.

e Non-functional Requirements
This section addresses how each of the non-functional requirements
identified in [1] which are pertinent to the Fraud Risk Management
System will be addressed.

e Enterprise Business Model
This section presents the data warehouse understanding of the
Pathway Business Model.

¢ Process Architecture
This section gives a high level breakdown of the processes required
to operated the data warehouse.

e Ad Hoc Queries and Standard Reports
This section lists the standard reports that will be implemented for
the data warehouse and describes how ad hoc query capability will
be supplied.

e Table Design
This section details the base version of the data warehouse physical
data model.

e Archival
This section describes how data will be archived from the system,
and how the archive will be restored to allow end-user queries.

e Audit
This section details how the auditability requirement for the data

warehouse will be addressed.

e Recovery Strategy
This section describes the backup and recovery strategy for the
data warehouse.

e Test Strategy
This section describes the strategy for testing the various
components of the data warehouse, and the data warehouse as a
unit.

e Appendices

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Those non-functional requirements which affect the specification of the
Data Warehouse are addressed in Section 3 “Non-Functional
Requirements”.

FRAUD RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS

The Fraud Risk Management requirements for ad-hoc query and
standard reports [3] are addressed in Section 6 “Ad hoc Queries and
Standard Reports”.

ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW

Figure 1 depicts the Fraud Case Management System in the context of
the Data Warehouse External Architecture. The inputs or sources of
data for the warehouse are shown on the left of the diagram, while the
outputs or users of the data are shown on the right. The scope of this
document is to the right of the left-most interface (depicted by the
vertical dotted lines).

2.1. FRAUD CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROCESS

The Fraud Case Database is a case management system, and as such
the principal function is the management of cases. A case may consist
of multiple encashments. The encashments in the case are
investigated and flagged as fraudulent.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Page 8 of 1

ft ificati Version: 1.1
Architecture Specification Date: 01/03/99

Figure 3 — Fraud Case Database Conceptual Process Architecture

Two types of reference data is required:- POCL and local. The POCL
reference data is loaded at the start of each day from flat files. The
local reference data (e.g. local codes/decodes) is maintained through
a screens based interface. Anomaly information is maintained using a
similar screens-based interface whereby certain objects (post offices
and card-holders) can be defined as anomalous on particular reports.

Most encashment data is sourced from the data warehouse through a
database link. However, for data that is more than 20 weeks old, it is
necessary to source data from an archive. This means that the archive
needs to be restored and when restored, the query should be run
against the archive. Queries can be defined and stored, and then run
against the restored archive at a later date.

Audit data relating to encashment and case enquiry and update is
stored and can be reported against.

2.3

SOURCE SYSTEMS

Source systems are depicted in Figure 1 (as “inputs”). These are as
follows:

« Data Warehouse

¢ Data Warehouse archive

¢ CMS/PAS (operational system and help desk)
e Reference Data

REFERENCE DATA

“Reference data” can be regarded as any data used to encode
something which is used by more than one system within Pathway.
Such data needs to be consistent throughout all systems, with a
synchronised release schedule. The reference data system will
manage the release of new reference data to all systems within
Pathway.

However in the first release of the Fraud Case Database, the reference
data will be sourced from the data warehouse (this is primarily due to
the uncertainty over whether a reference data system actually will
actually exist in Pathway by the time release 1c goes live).

INTERFACES TO SOURCE SYSTEMS

Interfaces to all source systems (including “Reference Data”) will be
defined in separate “interface definition” documents (one [at least] for
each service operator, where each supplier may own more than one
source system). These documents will describe the mechanism by
which data is extracted from the source systems, the availability of
data in the source systems, the format of the data and any special
configuration that is required to extract the data from the source
system.

USER SYSTEMS

User systems are depicted in Figure 1 (as “outputs”). User systems fall
into two categories:

1) Managed services being provided by CFM:
¢ Standard screen access to the Fraud Case Database

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Page 10 of 1
FUJ00152145
FUJ00152145

ICL Pathway Fraud case Management System: Ref: DW/DES/006

ft ificati Version: 1.1
Architecture Specification Date: 01/03/99

2) Ad-hoc query and reporting access (via the “Business Objects” end-
user query tool).

2.3.1 INTERFACES TO USER SYSTEMS

Interfaces to all user systems (except “Ad-hoc query” and “Standard
reports”) will be defined in the same manner as those for source
systems (see Section 2.2.2 “Interfaces to Source Systems”).

3 NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

This section addresses how non-functional requirements affecting the
design and development of the Data Warehouse will be satisfied (cf
(1).

3.1 SECURITY

There are two aspects to security: Security of the Fraud Case
Database server itself, and security of the data residing on the server.
The former will be addressed in the Infrastructure Specification (TBA).
The latter will be addressed using standard Oracle data access
security mechanisms.

Users of the data will have access to one or more Oracle “roles”, as
determined and controlled by the DBA. These Oracle roles in turn
confer access rights to the underlying data. The initial set of Oracle
end user roles will include:

1. Fraud Risk Management Reporting role
This will confer read access to all data required by the Business
Objects user

1. Fraud Risk Management Case Management roles
This will confer read/write access to all data owned by the user.
This role denies read/write access to the audit table.

1. Fraud Risk Management Supervisor role
This role will confer read/write access to all case data in the
system, and read access to the audit data.

1. Fraud Risk Management Super role
This role will confer all access to the user, allowing archive,
backup, recovery procedures to take place.

This is addressed in Section 9 “Audit”.

ACCURACY

This is addressed in Section 1.2.1 “Accuracy”.

DATA STORAGE

Data will be retained in the Fraud Case Database indefinitely until an
archive policy is defined. When such an archive policy has been
developed, data which has aged beyond its retention period, after

being archived (see Section 8 “Archival”), will be deleted from the
database.

WORKLOAD

The fraud case database will be designed (where possible, subject to
hardware constraints — see [x]) to support the following:

« Support ad hoc query access by the users identified in [x]

ARCHIVAL

This is addressed in Section 8 “Archival”.

PERFORMANCE

There are no stated performance requirements for the Fraud Case
Database. However, the Fraud Case database will be designed in
such a way as to facilitate the production of “standard reports” (see
[2][3]) and, where possible, ad hoc queries against data stored in the
fraud case database within a reasonable time frame.

TIMING

Batched queries against the archive will be driven by a simple
scheduler (e.g. cron).

EXTERNAL INTERFACE

All external interfaces (except for ad hoc queries and standard reports)
will be addressed in the appropriate Interface Specification (TBA).

3.10 LAYERED SOFTWARE

The Fraud Case database will be constructed using Oracle RDBMS
version 7.3.2 (or greater) and the associated tools and utilities,
SQL/NET version 2 (or greater).

3.11 CONTINGENCY

3.11.1 BACKUP AND RECOVERY
This is addressed in Section 10 “Recovery Strategy”.

3.11.2 DISASTER RECOVERY

This falls outside the scope of this document. It is to be addressed by
Pathway.

3.12 INSTALLATION

Supplied software will include installation scripts and supporting
documentation.

4 ENTERPRISE BUSINESS MODEL

This section presents the Enterprise Business model of Fraud Case
database which describes the business area of interest along with
attribute lists for each entity. The model is a third normal form entity
relationship diagram which outlines the scope and content of the data
warehouse (see Figure 4).

4.2 ENTITY TYPES

Figure 4 shows four types of entity; core entities (i.e. those entities
considered to be part of the fraud case database), reference entities,
and finally limited scope entities (where the fraud case database is not
interested in the entities themselves, but in statistics about those
entities).

The core entities can be considered as those which shall hold the data
which is critical to the fraud case database. The reference entities are
essentially lookup tables that are required to describe the core data.

4.3. CORE ENTITY DESCRIPTIONS
4.3.1 CASE
A case is a collection of transactions’ that are being investigated. The
transactions within the case will have some common feature such as
the same card holder, post office. A case is primarily used as a
container of transactions that are being investigated for the same
reason.
This data is entered by the operator during case creation and
maintenance. A case has the following attributes:
e Case owner
e Instigation code
e Unique Id
e Case creator
¢ Case status
e Investigation Liability
4.3.2 TRANSACTION

The transaction entity describes both the transaction that took place at
the counter of the post office, and the current state of the investigation
of that transaction by the Fraud Investigator. In the data model, this
conceptual entity has been broken into two logical entities:

e Specific Transaction details. These details include the transaction
date, the value, the payee role, the card number etc. Full details are
available in the logical data model.

e Transaction tracking details. These details include the status of the
investigation of the encashment, the closure codes that can be
assigned and any other codes that are used to track the
investigation of the encashment.

The first represents the physical transaction that took place at the
counter; the second (a more logical entity) represents how this
transaction is being tracked during the course of the investigation.

Relationship to case

A Case may contain one or many transactions, and a transaction must
belong to one and only on case.

ENCASHMENT

The encashment entity represents the details of the benefit that was
encashed at a particular post office on behalf of a particular
beneficiary. The details regarding an encashment are sourced from the
data warehouse. These encashment details are supplemented by a set
of codes that facilitate the tracking and investigation of the
encashment. An encashment has the following attributes:

e Specific encashment details. These details include the encashment
date, the value, the benefit type, the benefit due date etc. Full
details are available in the logical data model.

e Encashment tracking status.

Relationship to transaction

A transaction must contain one or many encashments, and an
encashment must be part of one and only one transaction.

AUDIT

The audit entity is designed to contain details of all updates and
enquiry accesses on the case and transtaion entities. The audit entity
contains the following attributes:

e Author of change

e Date of change

e Change of ownership

¢ Status

e old and new values before and after change

REFERENCE DATA LOAD

A certain amount of POCL reference data is required in the Fraud
Case database. Normally, reference data is available from a
centralised reference data system. This centralised reference data
system is being developed by Pathway. In the absence of this
centralised reference data system, the POCL reference data will be
sourced from the Data warehouse.

Reference data is loaded into the Fraud Case database at the start of
each day. A process on the Fraud Case Database will be invoked to
select the required reference data from the Data Warehouse into a flat
file. The flat file will then by transferred electronically to the Fraud
Case database platform, and the Reference data will then be uploaded
into the set of Reference data tables on the Fraud Case database.

5.2.1.2 CASE/TRANSACTION MAINTENANCE

Cases are maintained through a screens-based interface. The
functions that can be performed on a case by a normal user are:

e Create/Open Case

« Populate case

« Link case

§.2.1.3 CODES MAINTENANCE

Codes are maintained through a screens-based interface. The

« Update decode

5.2.1.4 BATCHED QUERIES TO RESTORED ARCHIVE

There may be a number of queries that are unable to execute against
the data warehouse because the data is older than 20 weeks. In this
case, the operator may store the query so that it runs against the
database when the archive has been restored.

The query details can be stored in a query table. The query details
must include the case id to which the result set will be attached, and
the month against which the query should be run. During the definition
of the stored query, the query will be constrained to a single month
(since only a single monthly archive can be restored at any one time).

At the end of a logical working day, a process will be invoked to run
any queries that can be run against the restored archive. The process
will check the date of the restored archive (if an archive has been
restored) and will select the set of queries that can be run against this
date. The queries will be run sequentially, and the result set for each
query will be attached to the case that has been referenced in the
query table. When a query has been run, the status of the query is
updated in the query table.

already been run successfully against the restored archive. The
retention period for queries that have been run will be 3 months.

PROCESSING SCHEDULE

BATCHED QUERIES

Stored queries will be run against the database at 20.00 hours each
night.

BACKUP

Backup is addressed in Section 10 “Recovery Strategy” (but will be
described in more detail in the Infrastructure Specification (TBA)).

TABLE DESIGN

NAMING CONVENTIONS

The following conventions have been adopted:

e Table Names. Tables have been named after the corresponding
entities.

e Entities. Entities have been named to reflect the purpose of the
entity.

e Indexes. Indexes have been named after the table name with a
suffix of _IXn where n is a numeric ranging from 1 to N, where N is
the number of indexes.

e Tablespaces. Data Tablespaces have been named to reflect the
purpose of the tablespace. Index tablespaces are name after the
data tablespace with a suffix of _IDX.

INDEXING STRATEGY

CORE TABLES

Indexes have been defined on all primary keys and on most foreign
keys in the core tables.

REFERENCE TABLES

Indexes have been defined on the primary keys of all reference data
tables.

TABLESPACES

Tablespaces are required for the following object types:
e Reference data tables

« Reference data indexes

¢ Audit tables

¢ Audit indexes

e Fact tables

« Fact table indexes

SIZING STRATEGY

The large fact tablespaces will be designed to be able to hold the
maximum expected data sizes, in order to avoid the problems
associated with tablespaces filling up at run-time. The maximum data
sizes are based on a retention period of 7 years. The sizes have been
calculated as follows:

e the CASE and ENCASHMENT tablespaces are sized based on the
assumption that 150,000 cases and 300,000 encashments are
expected per year. The retention period is assumed to be a
maximum of 10 years;

e the REFERENCE tablespace is sized on the assumption that the
only significant contribution to the tablespace is the POST OFFICE
reference data (20,000 post offices);

e the METADATA tablespace is based on sizing required for the
Business Objects data dictionary;

e the AUDIT tablespace is based on the fact that each every
encashment will be updated 6 or 7 times, every encashment will be
enquired on 4 or 5 times, and a case will be enquired on
approximately 15 - 20 times per encashment in the case.

e Data is assumed to be retained for 7 years.

e It is assumed that the average number of enquiries per case is 20
and that a case will be updated 10 times during its lifetime.

e It is assumed that an encashment will be enquired upon
approximately 20 times on average and will be updated 10 times (on
average).

e Average number of reports is 20.
e Number of primary event codes is assumed to be 20.

e Number of secondary event codes per primary code is assumed to
be 10.

e It is assumed that there are an average of 2 card per cardholder.

e It is assumed that approximately 25,000 cardholders will be
investigated over 7 years.

e It is assumed that the average number of card events per car is 5.

e It is assumed that the number of anomalies reported will be
approximately 1000 per year.

DISK SIZING

SUMMARY

Assuming that 9 GB disks are used, then 5 to 6 disks are required to
support the requirements (34 GB) of the Fraud Case database over the
next seven years. The growth in the database is approximately 5 GB.
This growth could be accommodated by adding a disk every year to
the platform. The performance implications of this policy need to
be considered and are beyond the scope of this document.

The table below summarises the overall disk requirement.

Storage Raid level 5
Storage 34 GB 41GB
Number of 9GB disks 4 5
Number of 4.5 GB disks I 9 10

The table below summarises the growth in the number of disks per
year (if disks are added on an as-needed-basis). Note that if disks are
added when required, there will be an I/O bottleneck in the early years
when all data and indexes are stored on the same disk. Note also that
when disks are added, a re-mapping will be required to optimise the
VO.

Storage Raid level 5
Storage 5 GB 6 GB
Number of 9GB disks 1 1
Number of 4.5 GB disks I 2 2

The recommended solution is to design a production sized database
from the outset for all entities apart from the case notes entity. The
case notes tablespace should be enlarged/grown over time.

ARCHIVAL

An archive policy has not been defined for the first release of the Fraud

Case Database.

AUDIT

The requirements for Audit within the Fraud Case Database (cf. [1])
may be summarised as:

a) All updates to cases are to be audited
a) All updates to encashments are to be audited

a) All attempted connections to the fraud case database are to be
audited.

a) Any change of relationship between a case and an encashment
will be audited.

Requirements c) and d) will be satisfied as follows:

1.1) all updates to the fraud case and encashment table will be
audited by means of a trigger on update/insert to the relevant
table. This trigger will invoke a stored procedure to capture key
audit data about the update/insert.

1.1) An audit report will be available showing the audit details for any
particular case.

Requirement e) will be satisfied as follows:

2.1) Any actual/attempted connections to the database will be audited
by using the Oracle audit facility to audit sessions and
connections.

2.1) An audit report will be available showing the audit details.

Requirement f) will be satisfied as follows:

3.1) All changes of relationship between a case and an encashment
will be audited by defining triggers on the relationship table, and
capturing and logging all details of the change using a stored
procedure.

RECOVERY STRATEGY

The requirements for backup and recovery are given in [??]. The
principal constraints may be summarised as:

ft ificati Version: 1.1
Architecture Specification Date: 01/03/99

10.1

a) there shall be no data loss

a) service shall be resumed within ???? hours of (notification of)
service loss

Requirement a) will be satisfied as follows:

1.1) The Fraud case Database will be accommodated on mirrored
disk. This minimises the possibility of loss due to media failure,
without undue impact on update performance. If update
performance is not so critical, then the database could be built on
RAID storage (level 5).

1.1) The Fraud case Database will be subject to a normal operational
backup and recovery regime, with full and incremental backups
taken.

Requirement b) will be satisfied as follows*:

2.1) If the database is corrupted, it will be recovered according to the
priority schedule given in Section 10.1 “Priority Schedule for Data
Recovery” (below).

2.1) Processes within the data warehouse will be recovered according
to the priority schedule given in Section 10.2 “Priority Schedule
for Process Recovery” (below).

The mechanisms for achieving the above will be detailed in the
Infrastructure Specification (TBA).

PRIORITY SCHEDULE FOR DATA RECOVERY

If the database becomes corrupt, it shall be recovered according to the
priority given below (in decreasing order of precedence):

1. Database Schema

2. Fact table tablespaces

3. Audit table tablespaces

4. Reference data tablespaces

5. Index tablespaces

2 assuming software failure or loss of database without loss of server or media
(disaster recovery is beyond the scope of this document)

restarted according to the priority given below (in decreasing order of
precedence):

1. Operating system services
2. Database Server(s)

the restored data warehouse archive.
* Overnight Load Processing

=> The loading programs that take the reference data and upload it
into the Fraud Case database

=> The loading proc that upload the CMS data into the fraud

case database

=> The loading process that upload the encashment data from the
restored data warehouse archive.

e¢ Backup and Recovery Mechanism

e The Archive and Restore Programs

=> Notification to an administrator that an archive needs to be
restored.

=> Notification that reports were not generated.

¢ The Client Interface
=> The maintenance of the RCDB reference data
=> The business objects reporting interface

= The client access to the Fraud Case database

There will also need to be series of tests to cover the operational
maintenance of the fraud case database:

¢ Database maintenance Scripts

« Unix Maintenance Scripts

« Emergency Procedures such as power failure

¢ = Media failure

11.1 TESTING PHILOSOPHY

In an operational system testing will concentrate on making sure that
the data entered into the database is correct and has integrity across
the whole database. This is particularly important in testing the batch
interfaces.

It is important to carry out end to end system tests early as possible in
the development cycle because any performance issues on load and
transfer or building of the aggregates need to be identified and fixed
before acceptance testing can take place. The development team
should not under estimate the amount of time that will be required for
system testing and devise a comprehensive test plan at the start of the
development phase.

ft ificati Version: 1.1
Architecture Specification Date: 01/03/99

11.1.1 TEST DATA

Test data will need to be provided early on in the development process
and this will need to be in the form of source files and database tables.

Also the test data files will need to be valid and have integrity so that
the other areas can also be tested such as database consistency and
client interfaces. Often, for load performance reasons, data
warehouses do not have data integrity rules built into the table
definitions, therefore, it is necessary to have a set of queries that
check for integrity after data load e.g. making sure all the dimension
keys added to the fact tables are valid.

11.1.2 TEST STAGES

As with any system under development the fraud case database
programs need to go through a series of testing stages which are
typically:

« Code Reviews

¢ Unit testing

« Integration testing

« End to End System Testing

« Acceptance testing

It is currently assumed that the first three will be conducted by CFM,
and the last two by CFM in conjunction with Pathway.

It is assumed that each stage will follow existing CFM standards and
be under configuration management.

Code reviews and unit testing are usually carried out by the
development team and when they are satisfied that the code modules
have passed unit testing they are handed on to the next stage where
they are integrated together and full tests run. An example of an
integration test would be to load one day’s set of source files then run
a set of queries from Business Objects against that data and then
check the results against the operational source systems. Acceptance
tests would be similar to the integration tests but with the users
carrying out the queries and could be carried out as part of the uses
training program.
