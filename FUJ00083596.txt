RE: PinICL List to a file

; Higman Lionel

As to the PINICLs themselves, I think that it makes good sense to postpone them from last minute fix releases, but given the amount
of money we pay for support, when we have a full regression cycle like (presumably) S10, I would want them ALL fixed, including the
D priorities. No exceptions. Chris has the final say of course...

Subject: PinICL List to a file

Brian,

You've obviously cracked the technology to enable a list of PinICLs to be extracted to a file. How is it done? Alternatively, can
you generate a list of the current Escher-Dev PinICLs into a file for me please. We need to go through an exercise of checking all
outstanding PinICLs (at least the Bs and Cs) so as to factor them into M1R / S10 drops from Escher. My belief is that many of
them can be "lived with", in which case they need to be downgraded to D (or at the highest C). The first step is to feed them into a
spreadsheet to start the discussions (hence the request). I'll probably be asking you for your input / thoughts on many of them.

Regards

Gareth Jenkins
