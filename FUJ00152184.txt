Incomplete TMS Audit Trail

Problem origination - CS Security in undertaking audit file data extractions. Notification to PON
Internal Crime Manager (Charles Leighton) on 9.5.01 advising that we are unable to source
evidential data.

Details of problem - An incomplete TMS audit trail for the period 8" to 14 August 2000 caused
by coincidental DLT failure at both datacentres. This was compounded by a loss by TNT Couriers
of one tape in transit to FELO1 for analysis. All other elements of the audit trail are complete.
Pathway is in contractual non-compliance until 15.02.02 (there is a requirement to retain audit
data for 18 months). Pathway cannot meet Requirement 699 and 829 in respect of these dates.

Temporary procedures - none

Current action - ICL Pathway have attempted to recover data from the Bootle tape both internally
and external via data recovery experts. The latter has concluded that there is a flaw in the DLT
media and recovery would only be 85% successful. This is no more than we could do ourselves. A
similar scenario would have been expected from the lost Wigan tape. A letter was sent from Jan
Homes (Pathway Audit Manager) on 23.5.01 to Sue Kinghorn (Consignia Internal Audit) to advise
of the problem

Next steps - Notifying the PON Problem Manager (Richard Benton! GRO {and advise.
We are writing to TNT Couriers to request and ongoing search for the mislaid package although in
the event of locating the missing package our chances of restoration of all data is highly unlikely.
Update problem database.

Next update - following discussion with Richard Benton on 23 May, 2001.
Closure Criteria - tba

Advised by Colin Lenton-Smith that at the CAB today Keith Baines raised the issue over the 6 days data
loss. He said he would discuss the significance of this with Charles [Leighton]. He raised two additional
questions:

FUJ00152184
FUJ00152184
FUJ00152184
FUJ00152184

1, What is the security impact of the lost tape - could a third party identify what the data is?
2. What are our processes for validating data held?

A response will be provided by cop 24/05/01.

24/05/01 10:15:57 - by Graham Hooper.

I spoke with Richard Benton and outlined the issue. I stressed that back-ups were taken and the problem
resulted from a corruption of both tapes relevant to the period in question - a situation that could not
reasonably have been foreseen. It is clear that Consignia's prime issue is in attempting to recover the lost
data - primarily in respect of evidence to support potential prosecutions. I advised that both Pathway and
Vogon Data Recovery had undertaken an analysis of the Bootle tape and concluded that not all the data
could be recovered. The cause of the read error on the Wigan tape is unknown and resulted in the decision
to forward this to FELO1 for analysis (during which it was lost by TNT). Richard asked why the Wigan
tape was not copied prior to dispatch to provide a backup. I advised that this was not possible as the tape
would not read and therefore could not be copied. This was accepted. It was agreed that the only
reasonable progression was to try and locate the lost Wigan tape so that an analysis and data recovery
attempt could be performed. To this end I advised that I had been trying to get TNT to undertake a search
but was not content that TNT were doing all they could to find the tape. I was today writing a letter to the
TNT Customer Accounts Manager to escalate the issue.

T also advised that Jan Holmes (Pathway Audit Manager) had written to his opposite number in Consignia
(Alison Kinghorn) to advise of the issue. Richard asked for a copy of that letter which I will forward.

Response for Colin Lenton-Smith provided in conjunction with Jan Holmes:

1. What is the security impact of the lost tape - could a third party identify what the data is?

Answer:

The information written to Legato tapes can only be read by dedicated Legato scanning software and
hardware or by specialist data recovery equipment. In the event that a third party obtained the necessary
Legato equipment and software, it is evident from the fact that the tape could not be read on the dedicated.
equipment at the datacentres that any attempt by a third party to do the same would not prove fruitful.
Specialist data recovery equipment is available primarily to forensic recovery experts such as Vogon
International, to whom Pathway referred the corrupted Bootle tape for analysis. These companies operate
strict controls to ensure that data recovery is attempted only for legitimate reasons. Assuming a third party
succeeded where ICL Pathway failed or managed to utilise other specialist recovery services, the
information on the tape is not in a readily interpretable format and it is not possible to infer to what it
relates. NINOs, DSS Order Book numbers, dates, amounts and Outlet codes would be evident but a third
party could not determine solely from this either from where the information originated or to whom it
related. In addition, the tape in question does not contain any label or other identifying marks that would
indicate its contents or source.

2. What are our processes for validating data held?

Answer:

The validity of the data held, and subsequently retrieved, is proven through the generation of a
ChecksumSeal at the time that the data is written to the DLT. This value is stored on a database, separate
from the audit data, and subject to an entirely independent backup process. When data is retrieved from
the DLT the Checksum Value is re-calculated and the result compared with the original value maintained
in the database. The results are recorded in the database and these are checked as part of the Extraction
process prior to despatch of data to PON.

It is possible to conduct a read-after-write activity on the DLT after each session. This has been
considered in the past and is the subject of ongoing debate. We have taken the view that this would not be
necessary for the following reasons :

FUJ00152184
FUJ00152184

a. Audit data is written to two separate DLTs, one at each Data Centre, thus providing a second copy for
backup and resilience.

b. The data is appended to DLTs over a period of weeks thus the tape is subject to repeated read/write
activity during the normal operation.

c. There is a time penalty in conducting read-after-write which would have an impact on already tight
schedules for the Legato drives.

There are a number of specifics which should also be taken into account : - The two DLTs originated from
two different batches. - We did not experience a write failure during the creation of this DLT over the
period in question. This is evidenced by Save Set status available from the Legato system

Letter drafted by GH and sent to TNT Couriers by Jane Hassard on 25/05/01 requesting assistance with
chasing the location of the missing package.

Paul Westfield queried status of problem. Advised that Database entry has been made, PON Problem.
Manager has been engaged and d/b updates being provided.

03/06/01 10:30:00 - by Graham Hooper

Response received from TNT Couriers apologising for the loss and stating that there had been a
discrepancy in the tracking system, which could have contributed to the problem. They fear that
the original addressing may now be incorrect.

Tam convinced that they are not trying hard enough to locate this package which must be
somewhere in their system. I propose to respond and to ask that a search of all unaccounted-for
items be made.

12/06/01 10:55:37 - by Graham Hooper

In order to provide some assurances that other Legato tapes are not corrupted, Pathway/ISD
propose to introduce write failure checking on archive tapes. Dates for introduction are being
clarified.

Joint Security Audit meeting held attended by Jan Holmes (ICLP Audit Manager), Gary Potts (PON
Audit), Charles Leighton (PON Internal Crime Manager) and Graham Hooper. The issue of the missing
audit data was an Agenda item. Both Jan Holmes and I explained the issue and answered questions about
the circumstances leading to the problem, which were difficult to anticipate.

Sourcing the missing data from elsewhere is unlikely although ICL Pathway will do what it can. The
important thing was to ensure that we take action as far as possible, to obviate a re-occurrence. We
advised that ICL Pathway would be introducing a "read after write" procedure that will provide assurance
that data is not corrupt when written to tape. PON requested that the next joint Audit of the datacentres
include tape-handling procedures. ICL Pathway is content with this and will undertake with PON in
September. TNT is no longer being used for the transport of media or other sensitive audit/security
information.

20/06/01 15:21:10 - by Graham Hooper.

Second letter sent to TNT from Graham Hooper stressing the importance of finding the missing item and
offering assistance in attending TNT sites to identify the package. Awaiting response.
25/06/01 15:43:01 - by Graham Hooper

The introduction of the "read after write" procedure has been approved for S06 release and is currently
being tested.

Confirmation from Pathway Development that SO6 testing on read after write has been completed.
Automated Media Management (to automate tape labelling) will be introduced on 20/8/2001. Cloning for
read after write will be switched on 3/9/2001. Awaiting response from TNT to second letter.

Routine housekeeping at the Datacentres has established the existence of a number of backup tapes, which
may span the lost data period. An internal change request has been raised to establish the periodicity of
the tapes and whether they can be used to reconstruct the missing audit trail.

Response received from TNT stating that they have recently introduced a database of missing items,
which can be searched against details of package contents. Details of the lost tape confirmed. They will
attempt to establish whether the tape and/or package is recorded on the system.

24/08/2001 12:55:32 - By Jean Woolley
23/08/01 14:54:50 - By Graham Hooper

Formal response received from TNT. They have carried out an extensive check of their TNT I.D Stores
database against the description parameters supplied for the lost tape. None of the items listed as possible
candidates provides a match for the DLT. TNT conclude that they have undertaken everything possible to
locate the lost tape and apologies for the difficulties this has caused ICL Pathway and any other third
party. I am now satisfied that there is no possibility of finding this tape. In any event it needs to be borne
in mind that the tape in question was corrupt before despatch so the likelihood of data recovery from it
was negligible.

The CP raised to explore the possibility of recovering missing data was approved by CCB. Work will now
begin on building the appropriate platforms as a precursor to undertaking recovery.

Update by Graham Hooper

The build of pseudo Audit Server and peripherals has been completed. Work has begun on loading backup
tapes but problems have been encountered with the PIT rig Autochanger, which is reporting a device
failure. An engineer is currently looking at the problem. It is anticipated that necessary repairs will be
completed today and recovery work can continue.

14/11/2001 09:08:28 - By Jean Woolley
14/11/01 08:24:13 - By Graham Hooper

The PIT rig Autochanger has been repaired. Recovery work is continuing.

03/12/01 11:38:51 - By Graham Hooper

Work is nearing completion on loading all backup tapes onto the pseudo PIT Audit Server rig as a
precursor to reconstituting the audit archive. The periodicity of data contained on the tapes is emerging. It
appears that whilst most of the missing audit trail can be recovered we may be left with a period of 2 days
for which we will be unable to reconstruct the archive. We should have a complete picture by the end of
the week and a full update will be provided then.

10/12/2001 12:03:54 - By Graham Hooper

Work has been completed on the loading of all backup tapes onto the pseudo Audit Server rig and
undertaking a full scan of the contents. We have now been able to determine the extent of the data they
contain and our ability to recover the data.

It is now clear that we are able to recover some 66% of the missing TMS data between the 7/8/2000 and
14/8/2000. The other 34% is not present on the tapes and is irretrievable. The recoverable data is present
in a number of partitions across the 4 Correspondence Servers for the period in question. In respect of RFI
8 (the request that highlighted the existence of the break) the unrecoverable period is from 19.27 on
Sunday 6/8/2000 until 16.09 on Monday 7/8/2000. This compares to the original reported break of
8/8/2000 to 14/8/2000 (late hoarding caused late reporting of the problem).

We intend to brief Consignia Security and Audit Managers with a view to determining how the issue
should now be progressed.

07/01/02 11:18:31 - by Graham Hooper.

Consignia Internal Audit and Security Managers have been briefed on the outcome of the data scanning
activities. In respect of RFI 8 (the request that highlighted the existence of the break) the unrecoverable
period is actually from 19:27 on Sunday 6 August until 16:09 on Monday 7 August. This compares to the
original reported break of 8 August to 14 August inclusive (late hoarding caused late reporting of the
problem).

Consignia Security has confirmed that the information requested on RFI 8 is not at this stage required in
support of a prosecution although this may change. It has therefore been agreed that ICL Pathway will not
need to recover this lost/found data at the moment, but will take steps to ensure that the information on
RFI 8 is stored and made available for recovery if requested to do so at a later date.
The cause of the lost data was a coincidental tape failure at both Datacentres. Analysis of the Bootle tape
confirmed the presence of a flaw in the DLT media, which would have accounted for the inability to read
the contents. We can currently only speculate on the cause of the read error on the Wigan tape since it was
irretrievably lost by TNT Couriers during transit to FELO1 for analysis. ICLP are presently undertaking
out a root causal analysis of DLTs to see if there is any common characteristic(s) that would

indicate the likely reason.

ICL Pathway has also introduced a number of additional measures to help avoid a recurrence:

* a"read afier write" procedure to provide assurance that data is not corrupt when written to tape and
to protect against the accidental use of flawed media;

e - Automated Media Management to automate tape labelling and thus reduce manual intervention:
- TNT Couriers are no longer used to transport audit or other sensitive media.

In addition, tape-handling procedures were reviewed in conjunction with Consignia Internal Audit as part
of the Joint Audit of the datacentres and the possibility of full tape cloning is being investigated to provide
a greater degree of resilience.

Whilst the action outlined above mitigates a recurrence, ICL Pathway has advised the Head of Horizon
Commercial and Consignia Internal Audit and Security Managers that measures to remove altogether the
risk of future tape corruption can be achieved only by a complete re-design of the current solution.
