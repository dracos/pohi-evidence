Thank you for your letter of 26" March.

I_am grateful to you for raising these issues with me. They are important to us and it is good to
have the opportunity to talk to you about them.

I have been considering the points you made with key people here at the Post Office. Rather than
write a long memorandum, I thought it would be best for us to meet again. I would like to explain
what the relevant procedures are and to suggest a way forward for giving you and your
colleagues’ confidence in the Post Office's willingness to take these concerns seriously.

1am always happy to come to you but it would be ideal if you were to come to our Head Office in
Old Street on this occasion: Would you be willing to do that? Perhaps you could let me know and
then we could get a date in the diary for after the Easter recess.
