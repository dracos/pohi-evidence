4. Introduction

The following Business Thread represents business scenarios which exercise the
integration of Pathway Releases IGL and 1b into 1c, plus the integration of BPS and
MIS.

2. Scope

2.1. Business Thread

This document explains the regression testing necessary to check the migration of
IGL and Release 1b POs to Release 1c plus new testing to check the roll-out of new
Release 1c POs. This checks the integration of OBCS and BPS within the DSS and
POCL Service Architectures, Interfaces to De La Rue, for actual Card and PUN
production, and Interfaces to Data Warehouse for the Corporate System’s production

of (MIS) reports. Reference Data from POCL will be loaded and checked, and
integrated with the POs counters, Autoconfiguration and Systems Management Roll-
out databases, and with MIS Data Warehouse.

The test rig will include an IGL PO and a Release 1b PO (to check each type of
migration and Systems Management for software delivery) and a new PO at Release
1c, to check Autoconfiguration.

Enough business type processing will be done to ensure that the system will run from
end to end; periodic week/month/quarter/year reports will require large amounts of
data matured over a number of months.

Whenever practicable, the system will be as live-like as possible. However, some
links will be found to be impractical - e.g. Sorbus Help Desk calls monitoring cannot
be done without recourse to a help desk actually being set up and used - instead, the
interface containing calls’ data will be composed manually. There may be other
examples of this which will be explained in the LLTSs after production of HLTPs.

This Thread will be the basis for development of HLTPs for Integration Testing.

2.2 High Level Test Plans

The testing of Release 1c for the Business Integration Testing activity will encompass
all of :-

POCL Reference Data initial drop,
Corporate Systems standing data initial load,
Initial take on of Post Office addresses and other BA reference Data,

‘Vanilla Build’ of Counters and their Autoconfiguration ready for use by POCL
Staff,

The maturing of customers card and payment data at IGL and the migration of
that data to Release 1c, the stopping of IGL cards and order of Release 1c
cards with a special migration PUN,

Maturing of customers’ Order Book encashment and stop data at Release 1b,

Migration of Release 1b to Release 1c,

Concurrent processing of Release 1b and Release 1c with the ‘hot list’ copy
and transactions merge over the two systems,

Ordering of new cards, payment authorisation and payment verification for
encashment,

CMS/PAS Help Desk processing for enquiries, and card and payment updates
on both IGL and ‘1c cards.

Corporate Systems reporting functionality at daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly
and yearly intervals,

When Release 1c goes live, all of the above happens over a short timescale of
about two weeks. On any one processing day there will be encashment of
Benefits using IGL cards, new 1c cards, Order Books at 1b Post Offices and
Order Books at 1c Post Offices. Once all IGL cards have been replaced and
all Release 1b Post Offices migrated, the Release 1c system will have
achieved a ‘steady state’ and BES regression tests and OBCS regression tests
will be run.

‘Steady State’ for the regression testing of BES and OBCS within the limited
EPOS shell.

POCL Reference Data maintenance,
BA Reference Data maintenance via CMS/PAS Help Desk,

Only two Low Level Test Scripts are envisaged :-

The first encompasses all of the activities required to achieve a ‘steady state’,

to the

point where all Release 1c take on and migration activities have

occurred.

The second LLTS encompasses regression testing of OBCS and BES at the
Release 1c ‘steady state’ position, where more functionality is explored.

FOR RELEASE 1c Version: 1.0
Date: 01/07/97

The philosophy underlying this decision is the control of test running. As identified
above, a lot of activities take place at the same time on IGL and Release 1b, then at
Release 1b and Release 1c. To fully test the integration of the system, activities must
take place simultaneously, sometimes across all Post offices counters present on the
Business Integration Test rig. Control of test runs will take place using time
(year/week/month/day/time) within Post Office, the Post Office being either migrated
or introduced for the first time at a specific time on a specific. day. The HLTPs reflect
the specific test conditions executed, but do not attempt to detail the exact time that
the test will be accomplished. For example, the file from CAPS is transferred every
day, and transactions etc. are reported back to CAPS every day. However, there will
be only one instance of each test condition within the HLTP, even though the HLTP
continues over many days (i.e. daily processing will be taken for granted).

2.3. Exclusions

See Ref. [7].

On-line Help.

This thread is limited to the infrastructure covered within Release 1c of Pathway and

is to be run within the processing outlined by the Business Integration Test team’s low-

level documentation.
3. Business Thread Id : BITO2Case Background

Business Thread BITO2 covers the Integration testing of Pathway Release 1c
using the OBCS/BES Riposte shell. It covers the acceptance of ‘Hot Lists’
containing the Order Book controls from the Benefits Agency (BA) via the
OBCS Access Service (OAS), distributing these controls to the appropriate
outlets, Back office and Counter Order Book processing , then sending the
subsequent transaction files back to the BA. In a similar way, it also includes
the loading of customer detail and payment authorisation files from BA/CAPS
and their distribution to the appropriate outlets, requests to De La Rue for card
production, the receipt, reconciliation and issuing of cards to customers within
Back office and/or Counter processing as well as encashment/impoundment of
cards at the Counter.

Many of the above transactions are reported via Corporate Systems at regular
periodic intervals.

The migration of customers’ details from IGL to Release 1c and any
subsequent re-issue of cards to those customers will also be tested. A similar
testing exercise is required for Release 1b cases to ensure correct migration.

Case Access Summary

Pathway will have an integration test rig consisting of a Sequent Server (the
Host System) supporting 6 outlets, with 4 outlets having one counter position

and 2 outlets being multi counter. The Data Warehouse will be contained in a
further Sequent Server, and Corporate Systems processing will be actioned on
its own Sequent host. All testing will be carried out under the control of the
Pathway Business Integration Test Manager. It will encompass operation at a
variety of outlets & counter positions, Agent processing and HOST system
processing. The outlet breakdown is to be as follows :-

Synopsis of Events
Migration - IGL to Release 1c.

Data matured at IGL must be checked to ensure it was migrated correctly. For
a time, both IGL and Release 1c cards will be valid, so encashments will be
done on migrated customers. The GiroBank Help Desk (a.k.a. CMS/PAS Help
Desk) will be utilised to check on card and payment status of both IGL and
newly issued cards.

Migration - Card Migration

IGL cards will all be migrated to the new Release 1c specification. A one-off
batch process will be run to stop all IGL cards and request a new card from De
La Rue. The new cards will be sent to the nominated Post Offices, and a
special migration PUN sent to customers. The GiroBank Help Desk (a.k.a.
CMS/PAS Help Desk) will be utilised to check on PUN status of newly issued
cards.

Migration - Release 1b to Release 1c

At Release 1c go live, the Release 1b Central Control file will be copied into
Release 1c Central Control, i.e. as a pre-cursor to any OBCS processing in
Release 1c. All controls relating to customers , both locally and centrally held,
will be deleted from Release 1b at Release 1c go live; thus both Release 1b
and Release 1c controls relating to customers will be re-learnt, as and when
Customers encash Order Books.

The link to CAPS will remain with the Release 1b Sequents until all Release
1b Post Offices have been migrated to Release 1c. At that point, the CAPS link
will be switched to the Release 1c Sequents.

OBCS

At the start of each logical day a BA-produced ‘Hot List’ will be loaded into the
Host System’s Central control file by an Oracle process. Until all Release 1b
Post Offices have been migrated to Release 1c, the ‘hot list’ will be copied
from where it is received on the Release 1b Sequents to the Release 1c
Sequents. The ‘hot list’ will be loaded into both the Release 1b and Release 1c
Host Systems.

The Distribution Agent will run to distribute all controls relating to any ‘local’
customers to the appropriate outlets. Until all Release 1b Post Offices have
been migrated to Release 1c, Distribution Agents will be run on both Release
1b and Release 1c.

At the end of each logical day the Harvester Agents will run to produce the
daily transaction file required by the BA. This will be sent back to the BA
through the OBCS Host. Until all Release 1b Post Offices have been migrated
to Release 1c, Harvester Agents will be run on both Release 1b and Release

1c. The transaction file from Release 1c will be copied to Release 1b and
merged with the Release 1b transaction file. A composite transaction file will
then be sent back to BA.

The above events will be repeated for each day of the test. The scheduling of
tasks will be governed by use of the Maestro scheduling server. Online
archiving also takes place.

BPS

Card and customers’ personal information is transferred from CAPS to
CMSI/PAS Host for use in card production and issue, for payment enrichment
and for notification of stops/end of customer interest, etc.

Distribution Agents will run to distribute all controls relating to any ‘local’
customers to the appropriate outlets.

Transactions will be done during the day of many types - card receipt and card
batch reconciliation, new cards collected by customers on card expiry and
against a PUN, change of nominated PO by customer, payment encashment
by customers and the impoundment of cards and/or PUNs.

During each day, Harvester Agents will run to produce the transaction files
required by the BA for notification of card receipt and reconciliation, card issue
and activation, encashments plus , at end of day, totals and reconciliations.
This will be sent back to the BA through the PAS/CMS Host..

The above events will be repeated for each day of the test. The scheduling of
tasks will be governed by use of the Maestro scheduling server. Online
archiving also takes place.

POCL Reference Data

Reference Data from POCL is required to enable Business Integration Testing.
At Release 1c, the only link to RDMC is for Corporate Systems’ use. There will
be an initial drop of data at Release 1c go-live followed by a trickle feed of
data, as and when Post Offices are closed or new Post Offices opened. No
product information is required in Corporate Systems from POCL at Release
1c.

BA Reference Data

Reference Data from BA is required to enable Business Integration Testing.
There will be an initial influx of data at Release 1c go-live. Maintenance
facilities available to an Administration User at the CMS/PAS Help Desk will be
utilised to input the data at ‘go-live’, and later to amend the data.

Corporate Systems

Transactions at the counters and various aggregated totals are harvested and

uploaded onto the Data Warehouse. Sorbus Help Desk send statistical data of
call times, and also data about kit and line failures at Post Offices. From there,
Corporate Systems access the data and manipulate it to produce various
reports. All calculations and related data required by Corporate Systems can
be input via screen interfaces. However, rather than input all of the details in
that way, a standing data file will be loaded at Release 1c go live.

Transactions at the counters will be harvested and uploaded to the Data
Warehouse. From there, various calculations are done for the production of
Corporate System’s reports. Reports will be produced over daily, weekly and
monthly cycles, and one year end will be simulated.

Autoconfiguration

All counters will be built to the so-called ‘Vanilla build’. Autoconfiguration will
be used to bring the existing IGL and Release 1b outlets into the Release 1c
system.

An additional Post Office will become known to the system so that the
Autoconfiguration of the Gateway and Counter PCs during roll-out can be
checked.

Software Distribution

TIVOLI will govern configuration of software. Update can be done in 4 ways :-
1. to all POs known to the Autoconfiguration database
1. to all PCs within a set of given POs
1. to all PCs within a single PO
1. toasingle PC

Software distribution via Tivoli occurs during roll-out - i.e. it is used during the
Autoconfiguration of the Counters. It is intended that new software deliveries
(e.g. bug fixes) will be delivered via Tivoli.

On-Line Help facilities

The entry to and exit from Bubble Help will be checked in this Thread.

On-line Help and Procedures manual and broadcast of Systems messages will
NOT be checked in this Thread.

On-Line archiving.

This will be checked in this thread.

System Administration

As part of the System Management non-functional requirement, alerts might be
raised via a Patrol Knowledge module in Sequents. - it may not be possible to
test these specifically There will be remote operations capability for recording

of events at Counters and their possible fixing by distributing software (via
TIVOLI). If practicable, elements of Network Management and Resource

Management will also be explored.

CMS/PAS Help Desk

Requests from POCL staff for encashment and change of nominated PO when
communications links are down will be checked. Card and PUN status will be
updated for combinations of damaged, lost and found. Maintenance of BA
Reference Data, which is passed on to Data Warehouse, will also be checked.
Sorbus Help Desk

There will be no direct link to the Sorbus Help Desk. Instead, interface files to
the Data Warehouse will be created to simulate problems with kit and lines at
Post Offices.

De La Rue

Card production requests and the actual production of cards and PUNS will be
checked.

De La Rue must also be informed of all Post Office addresses. There will be a
take on exercise of all Post Office addresses at the CMS/PAS Help Desk.

Backup and Archive

The backup and archiving of databases are scheduled through Maestro, so
will occur throughout the testing cycle.

Restore

A database restore and application of re-do logs will be checked.
