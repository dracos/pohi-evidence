Thanks Brian, look forward to meeting you then.
Please could you arrange for Anne Chambers to also attend? It sounds from Julie Welsh's email (copy attached)
that it was Anne who actually did the investigatory work and it would be helpful for me to speak to someone
directly involved at the time.
Kind regards.
