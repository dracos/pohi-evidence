ly analysis

larter going through the log file i can see there is a difference of 50000 between totalreceipts and total payments.

[this is happening because there is transferout of stock to another stockunit which is creating the difference between total
receipts and payments

lAs stated above, the Office Snapshot shows Total Receipts

00016.45, ie. 50,000 different.

90016.45, Total Payments:
this is due to a pending transfer for Cash of 50,000.

[the pending transfer reduces Value Items § MOP by 50,000, hence reducing TOTAL PAYMENTS by 50,000. This causes the receipts and
jpayments mismatch.

[the solution is is to calculate Pending transfers as node 3055 (Transfers out) - node 3054 (Transfers in), and ***for the purpose
lof checking receipts
Payments before checking if Receipts=Payments.

“payments only and not for printing on the report, and for the office snapshot only*** add this to Total

lA future enhancement would be for an extra line "Pending Transfers" line be printed in the Payments section - but this would be a
lchange to the report and would need approval from POL - and since we are working as Horizon does, there is not need to do this.

this PEAK should be downgraded from A to B - it is still important to fix as we don't want the Receipts <> Payments error to be
falsely generated as this would encourage the SSC to ignore it.

For the

hen the Receipts/Payments error occurs, in order to identify if the error is safe to ignore, then access the counter log to see
lif it occured as a result of the office snapshot.

If so, look at the following lines on the office snapshot:

TOTAL RECEIPTS 250016.45
TOTAL PAYMENTS 200016.45
transfers In 0.00
transfers Out 50000.00

[fhe error can safely be ignored if:
OTAL RECEIPTS ? TOTAL PAYMENTS = Transfers Out ? Transfers In

In all other cases the error is serious and must be investigated.

suresh,

Please can you be more specific about the data you want
las T am not allowed to send personal data. The tool that we use to
jbbfuscate data is not reliable and the output needs to be manually
checked. I have already provided a snippet of the PostofficeCounter.log

only able to provide 40 lines of log - so please be precise about what
information you require.

lin order to avoid the false error being logged at the time of generating Office Balance snapshot we need to add the
[transferOut (node3055) value to the total payments and Transfersin(node3054) to receipts.This is for avoiding false error being
logged not for printing in the report.
