Subject: Re: ARQ194/2011 Matter
Sensitivity: Confidential

Hello,

In the interest of getting back to you quickly, I am responding via Blackberry. I.have made a few changes as
per the text below but I am unable to highlight what I have changed. It should hopefully be obvious from a
quick re-read.

Any questions, let me know.
Kind regards
JP :

“Our RMG Account Fraud and Litigation Service are currently acting on.an ARQ (194/1011). This request for
transaction records, which covers March 2010, is in respect to an outlet (Derby 005207) which is already
migrated to HNG-X.

Because of a number of technical issues (errors detected) that arose during migration up to June 2010, and
which POL technical specialists are aware of, the information gathered in respect to this particular ARQ may
be subject to issues of integrity. Our technical staff have investigated the record in question and, at this
stage, although they report that'there is no obvious evidence of suspicious behaviour, they can add nothing
further with any certainty and they do not have the ability to determine if there really are any financial
implications with the messages. In other words, any response from us would have to bear the health
warning that there was no guarantee as to the integrity of the data provided by us.

The issue is of particular relevance in light of the fact that provision of an ARQ could’result in a request for a
Statement of Witness to support litigation activity. As such, any statement of witness provided would, in real
terms, have to feflect this.

I am passing this information to you, for'your perusal and comment as to how you may like this matter
managed going forward"

Subject: ARQ194/2011 Matter

All,

Please see below draft of proposed email to John Scott (POL Head of Security) re the Sysman3 matter,
associated with ARQ194/2011, we discussed yesterday. Penny has had a look at this, and has no further
comment. Would be grateful for any comment from yourselves, before we despatch this:

they report there is no obvious evidence of suspicious behaviour they can add nothing further, and have not
yet the ability to determine if there really are any financial implications with the message. In other words,
any response from us would have to bear the health warning that there was no guarantee as to the integrity of
the data provided by us. .

The point is that, as we all know, the provision of an ARQ, could result in a request for a Statement of Witness
to support litigation activity. As such, any statement of witness provided would, in real terms, have to reflect
this.
