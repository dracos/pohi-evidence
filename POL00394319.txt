NS confirmed that documents signed off via the soft
change process become contractual immediately upon
signing but added that it’s still worth capturing the details in
HSMF minutes

Issues arising from the Service Report

Noted

All SLT have been met for August. LT/RH commented that
complacency seems to be creeping in regarding some
issues and that the language /style used in the SRB was or
could be deemed to be inappropriate in some instances.

POL acknowledged the fact that risk is an integral part of
the new contract but asked whether POL need to be made
aware of any underlying problems. MR replied that NWB
has raised problems that were or went previously unnoticed
i.e. online services now directly affect the operation within
branches and any problems are highly visible. MR
admitted that the management summaries do appear to
focus on the SLAs instead of service review and will be
looking to review content for future SRBs. MR confirmed
that FS are having exactly the same discussions internally
regarding the service outages recently experienced.

This seems a bit mixed perhaps we should have a para
about each issue

RH express a concern from POL about there recent
incidents that had happened over the last 6-8 weeks and
wanted to understand if there was a underlying cause.

MR advised that at the moment it was proving difficult to
find a degree of commonality with the network problems
experienced. MR confirmed that extra monitoring was
being put in place to help identify root cause(s).

The recent Data Centre loss was discussed. MR explained
that the UPS problem was dealt with swiftly and was
pleased with the way the incident was handled. RH agreed
that as a single event there would be no cause for concern,
but due to the sequential events over the last couple of
weeks there is a high level of concern within POL. RH
asked that a joint workshop be put together as a matter of
urgency to investigate and discuss the technical problems
being experienced. RH asked that the output of the
workshop would be a presentation to DS/AB/RH which MR
agreed to deliver. RH also asked that an update be
provided to the October service review.

LT pointed out that whilst the Quantum problem was initially
caused by a procedural error the rectification seems to be
taking longer than anticipated. PB identified that an
underlying software issue was to blame and was now being
addressed. When is it going to be sorted fully ?

RB advised that they are continuing to apply pressure to
BT to help resolve the ongoing OBC issues however they
felt that they may not be able to get anything further. LT
asked that FS keep applying pressure on BT.

The nominal date for icons to be delivered with the S50
release is the 7" November. LT asked FS to supply a list of
affected icons. Early communication of the changes to
NBSC/branches would help to reduce call impact on NBSC.

AP230909

Cross domain problems were discussed in some detail and
the following points were made:

« PM0000263 Inappropriate Calls. Authority asking
branches to redial has been given by POL. The
Helpdesk ORF is agreeing the necessary scripts
23/09 and relevant branch communication required
advising of the impending change. It is expected
that this problem will be closed by the next HSMF.

« PM0000368 OSP. Changes are in hand at the
NBSC and should be in place by the end of
October. Does this mean the problem will be
resolved ?

« PM0000410 S40 regression failure. DH is still
waiting for FS to provide various elements of the
action list. Linked to the request for a technical
workshop in AP230902 FS are to give a
presentation to Alan Barrie/Dave Smith/Ruth
Holleran, which identifies rectification steps taken,
and the way forward with future releases. It wasn’t
only for this — it was for all the issues and outputs of
the workshop

e PM0000411 Replacement of image drum. RB
advised that the problem of supplying/delivering
printer drums to engineers is not insurmountable
and will be sorted out quickly by FS.

FS to present S40 findings and way forward to Alan
Barry/Dave Smith/RH.- see earlier note

RH referred to the last paragraph in the 4.3.3 summary and
asked that if FS have any issues with POL Problem
Management that they should contact her in the first
instance.

MR/RB

10 Oct

Noted

Agreed

Comments on the scorecard were discussed. RH/LT
pointed out that a number of comments from FS gave the
impression that there was an element of ‘sidestepping’ and
‘tit-for-tat’ creeping in to the scorecard comments. MR/RB
agreed that in future the wording should to be sanitised
internally before releasing the final version to POL.

The POL score of 3.67 on FS equates to 7.67 on the
internal FS scale.

that whilst it is not required on a day-to-day basis it would

problems arise. RH suggested that if a letter is required
from her to help move things along to let her know and for

full visibility of all issues LD was asked by RH to feed back

activities occurring at the same time and that the release
plans need to be combined to cover all releases whether
they are system or not so that full visibility is given going
