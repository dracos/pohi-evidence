Attachments: Superbriefer briefing 20 August 2013 - this financial year.doc

Hi Paula, we will follow up on all your comments and requests but as super briefers are out tomorrow I have attached
the brief as requested. There is also a Q&A document if you want it.

The last of the training session is taking place today with 70 going out into branches tomorrow.

In a nutshell the branches are being told our expectation on timing (either this financial year or next), an update on the
consultation process, reminder of employee options and a wider transformation update.

The plan is to get super briefers out across the entire Crown network through September to coincide with the launch of
the new magazine, conference calls, helpline open and roll-out of noticeboards.

Mark, thank you this is very helpful.I have made some comments below in CAPS (nb., if someone can show me
how to change the colour - that would be far mor effective - please!).

Most important is that you have a truly great break - it is well deserved! I shall not disturb you unless really
urgent and then I'll text first. You have a great team who know they have my confidence.

Please can the appropriate individuals respond to my queries. I haven't put names, as I assume you know who
you are :)

Thanks

Tam on leave as of this evening until Sept 4 so I wanted to give you an update on where things
are. I have copied the comms lead team, and Sophie for public affairs (and any queries anyone
copied has, please do follow up with me tonight/tomorrow).

CWU: I met Tom and Martin E this week to feed in my thoughts ahead of the Board session. I
think there will be great value in this session - a chance to reflect on why we are where we are
and deep dive all options for next steps.

Following the announcement of the latest ballot result, I have written to the CWU comms team -
in a conciliatory fashion - to highlight the risks to customers from their public messaging. Nina's
team are across preparations for potential strike action. Superbriefers will be in the 70 franchise
branches on Tuesday to update on process (comms to announce this have gone out this week).
CAN I HAVE A COPY OF WHAT THE SUPERBRIEFERS ARE BRIEFING PLS?

I believe some members of Exco believe we are not being sufficiently forthright in the dispute. I
tend to disagree - it is generating limited coverage in media terms and I am not sure an
aggressive stance would be of benefit. I know this will be discussed next week so please do call
if you would like to discuss further. 1 AGREE COMPLETELY. THIS MAY CHANGE IF WE
SEE IA GOING INTO PEAK SEASON - THE PUBLIC PRESSURE AND THEREFORE
STORY MAY NEED TO BE DIFFERENT THEN. (I WILL FORWARD A SEPARATE NOTE
ON THIS.)

Additionally, Richard has been working with Fay on comms on the CMA ballot which has gone
out to middle managers. THX - GOOD THEY MISSED BANK HOL!

Horizon: we are preparing to next week make a proactive announcement on re creation of the
mediation panel. This will be targeted at media which have previously covered the issue with a
view to taking control of the communications. Ruth will work up a statement. This will also
trigger approaches to MPs to invite them to discuss the process with Angela, again with the aim
of taking control of the issue. NEED TO CHECK THIS WEEKEND'S COVERAGE, AS IT
MIGHT BE HELPFUL IN GIVING STEERS AS TO WHERE WE CAN FOCUS THE
MESSAGE TO CORRECT ANY MISINFO PUBLISHED YESTERDAY AND TODAY. I
WOULD LIKE TO SEE OUR ANNOUNCEMENT BUT.. NOT UNTIL IT HAS BEEN
SIGNED OFF BY SUSAN AND ANGELA. AND IF I AM NOT AVAILABLE, PLS DON'T
HOLD UP FOR ME.

We are getting media calls about the cases which have been dropped, and this points to the need
to get the mediation panel story out there.

RMG prospectus: We are working with legal on this. The section on risks is very problematic for
PO. The PR team are across it and I have asked Mike to also work on it from his perspective.
AM AWARE THX.

Public purpose engagement: Working towards announcing engagement process on 30th

August working with the Public Engagement Working Group. Comms will be through our BAU
channels and information about how to get involved will be on our website. COULD DO WITH
A ONE PAGE (IE., V BRIEF) UPDATE ON WHAT IS HAPPENING - AM OUT OF TOUCH.
THX

Corporate Brand: Met with Stewart around potential advertising our corporate message, and now
working on a combined Brief which defines objectives, in advance of a workshop to discuss
channels, messages, positioning and KPIs. SO DOES THIS AFFECT THIS AUTUMN'S
ADVERTISING? BE GOOD IF IT DID - THOUGH THE TIME SEEMS A BIT TIGHT?

Strategy: the team are well prepared for the strategy announcement and have been working on
narrative with Sue's team. The top lines we would push when announcement comes are:

- acceleration of NTP

- protection for community offices
- expansion of network

- focus on customer benefits

The priorities for the next two weeks, in parallel with the negotiations, will be to continue work
on the public/internal narrative, the announcement action plan and the Q&A which will sit
behind the announcement.

We must be realistic - the proposals at present, even if agrees with NFSP, will not prevent noise.
But I do feel we are developing a strong story to support them. NOT CONVINCED WE WILL
EXPAND V MUCH - NEED TO CHECK THIS WITH SUE B - LATEST THINKING IS WE
MAY NOT NEED BASICS. BUT IT DOES MOVE IN AND OUT :) !!

Interim results: work is now underway for the half year results, with finance. From a comms
perspective, this will be led by RZW team for design and production (online only) and Mike's
policy team for content. Nina and the team will recommend the media approach closer to the
time depending on the media and political environment. On the ARA, we've been getting copies
our to stakeholders and MPs, and I'm sending a copy to each member of SLT. HAD NO
FEEDBACK ON ARA - HAVE WE HAD ANY?

Cost reduction: we are planning a scene setting piece of comms from Chris for today, to be
followed by a programme of weekly/fortnightly updates. RZW is also working on a plan for
leadership behaviours comms/engagement. In terms of comms and cost reduction I have asked
RZW, Nina and Hazel to work with marketing and digital to seek ways to cut duplication and
also improve engagement with SPMRs by streamlining and quality controlling the way we
communicate with the network. We need a gating process which will quality control and plan
network communications more effectively - and I think this has potential to reduce costs. GOOD
- THIS WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT. KEEP CHRIS' FEET TO THE FIRE ON IT!! (TELL
HIM I SAID SO :)

T hope this helps.

Cheers
Mark
