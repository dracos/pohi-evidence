All

| think we (the legal team) need to take charge of this process. Whatever documents are produced are likely to be
disclosable and | would like as far as possible for this to be covered by privilege or have controlled their content.

1. Asa first step, | would like Sree to copy all emails on this topic (past and future to Jonny). Jonny please then
keep these someone separate and safe. He should then be instructed to take no further action for now.

2. Second | would like to escalate this to Pete and Torstein at FJ, so that they can produce for us a full (and
privileged) note on what has happened and why there is no alternative but to editing the data.

3. Third, we can then make a decision on how to proceed in light of the full facts.

| understand that this is going to cause operational problems and risks in this branch, but if not handled properly this
could be disastrous for the Group Litigation.

Angela / Mark - Do you agree with this approach? If so, who else do we need to put in the loop on this?

Subject: FW: Item 21751 [BD-4A.FID27032497]

Andy,

I've spoken to Sree and he has sent me the email chain below by way of further background. In summary, Post Office
have exhausted all other possible ways of cancelling this TC and | agree that there is no alternative but for FJ to
manually remove it.

Some key points:-

¢ the TC relates to a redundant product that this branch never sold - Post Office reinstated the product and
gave the branch permission to sell it, but it was still not possible for the branch to accept the TC;

e Post Office cannot issue another TC to net the first one off for the same reason (the branch wouldn't be able
to accept it);

e the TC was issued due to human error rather than a technical fault;

e the branch is a McColl's branch, so it's less likely that the Claimants in the GL will become aware of the issue
and get the wrong end of the stick; and

¢ in Sree's view the real risk to Post Office is not fixing the issue — as it's preventing the branch from completing
its trading period the branch may have.be incurring losses and in the circumstances Post Office is likely to
have to pick those losses up.

Are you happy for me to give Sree the green light to have FJ remove the TC?

Thanks
Jonny

Subject: RE: Item 21751
Hi Sree/Matt,

We have had a further look at this and we do not believe that the sell mode being ended for this item has any effect
on the branches ability to accept the TC. This is common practice for when an item is ended and as the mode for TCs is
still live, they should be able to accept.

However, having looked at the error message provided, it looks like the settlement icons applied to the branch may
be the issue. | have checked a number of the other branches that had this item added to them and it looks like it is
only allowed for Crown and CTO branches which have different accounting items to Mains (which is what Moorfields
is).
POL00254632
POL00254632

Moorfields currently has 6483 & 6487 ncl’s which is correct for the branch type (Main multiple) but Crowns and CTOs
have the accounting items of 6481, 6484, 6485 & 6488. | believe one of these is the accounting ncl required to allow
the branch to accept the TCs but | do not know what the other implications would be of adding these items to the
branch.

Therefore | think the possible answer would be to add these accounting NCLs and remove the current ones (as | think
these will conflict if the branch has all of them) and then change them back ASAP as this could cause other
implications at the branch

| need to travel back to Chesterfield so will be unavailable after 2.30, but | have copied in Suzanne who can allocate
the change to someone to complete if this is authorised. | have created worklist XXX/328504/2 in MDM with the
change already created in it, so this will just need to be validated authorised if the decision is made to proceed with
this option. This will then need to be backed out as soon as the TC has (hopefully) been accepted to resume normal
service at the branch

Sree — Please can you confirm if you authorise this change, if so, this will be in place from tomorrow. I’ve provided
Matt and Suzanne the Incident reference if someone could update the POSD, and also let the branch know to try again
tomorrow (pending the worklist being authorised before 5pm today). If the branch could also be informed that this
may temporarily impact some other areas of accounting with their usual accounting NCLs being ended, but this can
then be reverted once TC is confirmed. The other option may be to leave this until Monday as change back would be
tomorrow and therefore if there are any issues these wouldn’t be resolved until after the weekend

Thanks
Ellie
