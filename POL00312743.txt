 Not quite _._ v.e say that transrac ions entered by S. PCv R s cannot be recd ited but we don r a; on to say that FJ ran input
 new transactions in exceptional circumstances. This information would therefore be entirely new news to SS.

We've been through the prosecution file for M056 — Wylie. There will be further documents to disclose including the
attached witness statement by Gareth Jenkins. At the top of page 3, Jenkins states:

"I also note a comment made about it being passible to remotely access the system. It is
true that such access is possible; however in an analysis of data audited by the system, it
is possible to identify any data that has not been input directly by staff in the Branch.
Any such change to data is very rare and would be authorised by Post office Ltd.
As I have not had an opportunity to examine data related to this Branch, I cannot
categorically say that this has not happened in this case, but would suggest it is highly
unlikely."


I'm pretty certain that Jenkins is referring to the Balancing Transaction process that allows FJ to input new transactions
rather than edit old transactions. Nevertheless, this will be a red rag to Second Sight.

Can we discuss how to deal with this when I'm at Old Street tomorrow?

I don't think we need to bottom this out before the SS meetings. We'll just say that we are still working on reviewing
the legal files for this case.

PS. I'll send through a full update on where we are with the legal files shortly.

Kind regards
Andy
