Your statement is fine and is all you can actually say. If they can stump up the cash the counter equipment can won't be
of much use as the 42 days retainer of the message store is long gone, and will be endorsed by Gareth.

Morning Andy,

That court case reared its head again a few weeks ago. You remember I analysed a couple of counters back in July 07
then you got me to sign a new witness statement in June 08, well they came back again and wanted me to sign another
one - just a single paragraph to say the counters were in ‘full working order and would not cause a discrepancy’.

I was not happy with the implications of ‘full working order’ since I did not perform test transactions on the counters so I
provided a new paragraph to reiterate my previous statement - that the files thereon were correct and the counters should
be expected to perform as required.

The reason for my email, now the defence are hiring an expert to analyse the equipment I just wanted to make sure POA
are not solely relying on my analysis - I assume we have supplied evidence of the transactions going through and the
systems working correctly? I'm just trying to reduce the stress I feel whenever this pops back into my head!

Phil

Sorry for not getting back to you - we had another hearing and the trial has been adjourned for further enquiries as the
defence want an expert to analysis the equipment and they need to get funding.
Thanks for the statement I will forward it to our legal team.
