Branch had received some TV stamps in the REM which weren’t ordered.
Pmr tried to put them into REM surplus, but got mixed up, and somehow
tripled the amount she was supposed to have.

I went t the office, as the pmr had got very confused, and was unsure what
to do next, as she had been give the wrong info from the helpline
previously.

I entered £1882 into REM shortage, this gave a figure left in REM shortage
as £37.26- I then put £33.26 into REM shortage, this made the REM
shortage £4, which it was previously.

I explained that she would carry the £1882 as a surplus until the next
branch-trading period, and then if she settled centrally, this would cancel
out the shortage she had declared. She would still have the £4, and she
needed to deal with this separately.

The pmr was relieved to have got the office sorted, and thanked me for my
time.
