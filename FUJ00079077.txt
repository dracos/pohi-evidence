Further to my conversation with Peter Chariton, I can now advise you of the
following. Using your comment numbering scheme: -

It has been agreed that these comments will be
addressed as Business Continuity issues.

A caveat will added to the Authorities Acceptance

Proposed text below.

An additional EPOSS test has been added which shows
that the outlet Transaction Log does contain
transactions captured and committed within a customer
session.

A caveat will added to the Authorities Acceptance

Specification Consolidated Caveats document.
Proposed text below.

27 - 475/3 It has been agreed that issues concerning HCI usability
may be captured during the Outlet satisfaction surveys
due to be conducted at the end of Live Trial.

The proposed caveat text is as follows: -
Comment 7 - OPS/TMS Boundary

" of the OPS / TMS boundary issue concerning whether the Service
boundary between OPS and TMS shall be defined as the physical
separation between an outlet and a point in the ICL Pathway Data
Centres, or as the programmatic interface between the
APS/BES/OBCS/EPOSS/PCDF counter applications and the TMS
message store.”

Comment 24,25, 40,41 - provision of OPS & TMS technical documentation

" of the provision of OPS & TMS Technical documentation to support
external procurement of applications issue concerning whether ICL
Pathway should provide documentation as part of R2 Acceptance or for
ICL Pathway to support POCL (through the supply of documentation and
other methods) via forums such as the Joint end-to-end Design Board
and Sales / Marketing initiatives to enhance the capabilities of the
Horizon programme.

All of the above have been included in version 1.7 of the Acceptance
Specification, together with the various corrections you have advised me of
today.

Of these corrections, I can advise you that: -

e Section 7 - The Test data will be contained in a variety of Low Level test
scripts. I will advise you of these details separately.

e Your comments against 478/7 and 467/4 re FTMS - my memo of 18/12/98
advised that tests 4.4.1.1 to 4.4.1.10 comprise the FTMS tests and in
particular 4.4.1.6 and 4.4.1.9 cover transient fails in the transfer. I have not
made any change to the AS.

e The test details for 468/1 - "20 counter outlet" tests are not yet available. I
will advise you of this information as soon as I have it.

Subject to a final review of the above I believe that we have now completed this
AS and we should soon be able to achieve sign-of.

Many thanks for your assistance in helping to achieve this.

Regards,

Dave Cooke
