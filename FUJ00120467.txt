Version: 2.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 22/01/02

1.0 Introduction

The Network Banking (NWB) report set produced by ICL Pathway central systems
has been designed to enable NWB transactions completed in the outlets to be
reconciled to the outlet Cash Account and settlement to be made with Post Office
Limited (POL) clients, e.g. Link, or direct settlement to specific clients.

ICL Pathway central systems will produce a suite of reports in accordance with the
rules documented within ‘CS/SPE/011; Network Banking End to End Reconciliation
Reporting’, which reconcile all the individual transaction components making a NWB
transaction. Reconciliation is essentially at two levels, the counter reconciling with the
‘Client’ and the counter reconciling with POL central systems — the Cash Account.

In addition to those exceptions reported by ICL Pathway within the NWB report set,
reconciliation errors may be discovered by POL when reconciling data within it’s
central systems or relating to queries from POL clients. To initiate the Business
Incident Management Service (BIMS) process, ICL Pathway or POL Transaction
Processing (TP) or Business Service Management (BSM) generates NWB Business
Incidents for one or more exceptions or reconciliation errors discovered.

The incident management process is generic for all services. Electronic Point of Sale
Service (EPOSS), Automated Payment Service (APS) and NWB incidents are raised,
documented and progressed to resolution in the same manner. It should be noted
however, that where a NWB incident DOES NOT affect reconciliation within POL
Transaction Information Processing (TIP), the provisions quoted within the Codified
Agreement (CA) schedule G01, in respect of charges levied for Manual Error Reports
(MER), DO NOT apply. Definition and charges for NWB / Transaction Processing
Service (TPS) related errors, subject to the provisions of CA schedule G01, where the
incident has caused a reconciliation or settlement error within TIP are found in
associated ICL Pathway document: ‘CS/PRO/I11: TPS Reconciliation & Incident
Management’

3.1.5 NB102 — Exception Summary

The report identifies all incomplete or exception states.
This report is divided into 12 sections:
Section 1: Uncleared confirmed, unconfirmed and TIP exceptions <24 hrs

e Reports exceptions by ‘Incomplete or Exception System State’ and reconciliation
date. Where no exceptions are reported for a particular system state, the row is
suppressed.

Section 2: Uncleared exceptioned client transactions

e Reports NBE exceptions, (D), individually listed in system state order and
reconciliation date where the incomplete or exception state suggests an urgent
resolution is required to avoid customer dissatisfaction

Section 3: I Uncleared NBE / DRS corruption’s

e Reports NBE / DRS corruption’s individually listed in system state order and
reconciliation date.

Section 4: Uncleared timing differences

e Reports transaction components where there is a difference in the reconciliation
date and the posting date allocated where an ‘S’ has been received with an earlier
or later date than the ‘C4’. The ‘C4’ automatically assumes the ‘S’ reconciliation
date however the transaction is exceptioned.

Section 5: Uncleared confirmed, unconfirmed and TIP exceptions >24 hrs

e Reports defined uncleared exceptions (see CS/SPE/011) previously included within
Section 1 which have remained uncleared for a period of greater than 24 hours.
They are removed from section I and listed individually in system state and
reconciliation date order.

Section 6: Uncleared future dated settlement transactions

e Reports any transactions received by the DRS from the NBE which are ‘future
dated’ — Settlement date > report run date +3 in system state and reconciliation
date order.

Section 7: Cleared confirmed, unconfirmed and TIP exceptions <24 hrs
e As section 1 — exceptions cleared and set to ‘F99’ by ICL Pathway MSU
Section 8: Cleared exceptioned client transactions

e As section 2 — exceptions cleared and set to ‘F99’ by ICL Pathway MSU
Section 9: Cleared NBE / DRS corruption’s

e As section 3— exceptions cleared and set to ‘F99’ by ICL Pathway MSU

3.1.6 NB103 - Settled Transaction / Cash Account Reconciliation

Statement

This report allows POL to reconcile the settlement stream against the outlet Cash
Account stream. This reconciliation is required as settlement with the individual POL
clients is based upon the reconciliation date, i.e. the business day upon which the
transaction took place — this is carried right through the ‘C4’, ‘S’, & ‘D’ transaction
components. To complete a full reconciliation, it is important to know which Cash
Account the settled transaction was posted to, in order to enable a reconciliation of
settlement to be made with the outlet records. This report reconciles the transactions
by reconciliation date and Cash Account record.

1.

NB103 is run weekly: In order to align with internal POL / TIP processing it is
required that this report is produced AFTER TPS processing on Friday and
BEFORE TPS processing on Saturday. The report will include all C4, S and D
transaction components where:

¢ reconciliation date = run date and,

e reconciliation date = run date — ‘N’ (where ‘N’ = I to 13).

Where a C112 is available and the CAP is known, the transaction will be posted

against the appropriate CBDB applicable to the reconciliation date — (see rules 6 &

7)

Where no C112 is available and therefore the CAP is unknown:

e the C4, S and D transaction components will be posted to ‘No Cash Account
Allocated’ (Column 7

e then, when the C112 becomes available, the entry will be deleted from ‘No
Cash Account Allocated’ (Column 7) and posted to the appropriate CBDB
week applicable to the reconciliation date on the C112 (see rules 6 & 7)

e ifno C112 has been received after 14 days, the entry within ‘No Cash
Account Allocated’ (Column 7) will remain until the C112 becomes
available even if this exceeds 14 days

If a transaction is posted to the row ‘No C/A to TIP’ (according to it’s

reconciliation date):

¢ the transaction will remain in this row until the Cash Account has been
delivered to TIP and then move up into the row ‘C/A to TIP’

e  ifno Cash Account has been delivered to TIP after 14 days, the entry within
‘No C/A to TIP’ should will until the Cash Account is delivered to TIP
even if this exceeds 14 days

As the report is run each week, the transactions will move across the report

according to the CAP and the reconciliation date; for example, a transaction where

the Cash Account has been delivered to TIP and posted to CBDB>=plus 2 in the
first week, will move to CBDB plus I the second week and then appear in CBDB
the third week, until disappearing off the report after 14 days

This report identifies VALUE only against five Cash Account Periods (CAP’s).

Those CAP’s equate to the Counters Business Database (CBDB) date, the CBDB

date minus 1, the CBDB date <=minus2, the CBDB date plus 1 and the CBDB

date >= plus 2. In addition, those settled transactions, which currently have not
been allocated a relevant CAP, will also be identified.

7. The CBDB CAP equates to TWO CAP’s prior to the CAP applicable to the run
date of the report. For example; if the report was run on Saturday 20" January
within CAP42 (CAP 42 commenced on Thursday 17" January), the CBDB CAP
would be CAP40 (CAP 40 commenced on Thursday 3" January, ended
Wednesday 9" January).

8. Where the CAP in which the outlet is trading is numerically more than 2 weeks
prior to the CBDB CAP, if this takes the outlet CAP into the previous year, this
will be reported as such. For example; the CBDB CAP is CAP I and the outlet is
trading in CAP 51, this is assumed to be CAPS1 of the previous year, (therefore
CBDB <=minus2) and not reported ahead in the current year.

3.2. Report Distribution & Checking

Both daily and weekly reports will be available by 08.00hrs the day following the run

date of the report to:

e POL/ TIP gateway: The Host writes the reports to an appropriate directory. These
are picked up by FTMS and posted to the TIP gateway. (As per other Host to
external system applications)

e ICL Pathway CS/MSU DRS Workstation - MSU will check each report for
mathematical accuracy only.

All reports will be produced as ASCII text files — one for each report. The report

layout will be fixed format with space characters providing the blank space. This will

allow for ‘Excel’ input, using fixed field width facilities. Any formatting, (lines and
shading) will not be included within the file
3.2.1 Contingency in the Event on Non delivery of reports to PON

If ICL Pathway are unable to deliver all or any individual report to the POL / TIP
gateway by 08.00hrs the day following the run date of the report, ICL Pathway MSU
Manager will liase with the Network Banking Settlement Team Leader POL / TP to
arrange an e mail transmission via the ICL Pathway account within the POL corporate
mail system of reports NB101a and NB101b only. ICL Pathway / MSU will operate
this contingency under ‘reasonable endeavours’ and will aim to have the reports with
POL by 08.00hrs. However this timescale may not be achievable if processing
problems have also delayed receipt of the reports into the DRS workstation. Should
the POL corporate mail system be unavailable to ICL Pathway, then ICL Corporate
mail is used as an alternative.

NB: Should the corporate e mail service of either organisation be unavailable, the
Manager ICL Pathway /MSU will liase with the Manager POL / TP and agree
facsimile of reports NB101a and NB101b only.

Any distribution list for these reports is considered by both ICL Pathway and POL to
be of a dynamic nature and therefore specific addressees are not covered within this
document.

4.0 Reconciliation & Incident Handling
4.1 Incident Classification

4.1.1 NWB Business Incidents

Business Incidents relate to the ‘Symptom’ of an underlying cause — e.g. the effect of
the system fault on the resulting reconciliation or settlement information sent to POL.

A NWB Business Incident relates to one or more of the exceptions reported within the
NWB Report Set, or one or more reconciliation or settlement errors / disputed
transactions raised in accordance with this document by POL / TP / BSM. (Refer to
section 6.0 for a list of those NWB Business Incident incomplete or exception states
currently known and for which appropriate NWB Business Incident reporting
processes are set out in this document).

4.1.1.1 NWB Reconciliation Report Exceptions

Exceptions reported within the NWB reconciliation report set will be applicable to:

Communication difficulties between the outlet and the Campus
Communication difficulties between the Campus and the NBE
Errors within the NBE

Errors within the DRS

Errors causing TIP transactions not be harvested

Corruption’s within the NBE / DRS

eeoeeee

4.1.2 System Incidents
System Incidents Relate to the underlying ‘Cause’

Following the creation of a NWB Business Incident, ICL Pathway may raise an
associated System Incident to identify and repair the underlying cause of a NWB
Business Incident. System Incidents will be routed to the appropriate group within ICL
Pathway, for investigation and resolution.

Where there are associated System Incidents and NWB Business Incidents, their
relationship can be either:

NWB Business Incident Originators

Generation of Business Incidents

In line with the generic incident management policy agreed between ICL Pathway and
POL, NWB Business Incidents will only be recognised as such if generated by ICL
Pathway or POL as appropriate, via the HSH or via the ‘Enquiry Service’. This
ensures that the NWB Business Incident is properly logged, enabling ICL Pathway /
MSU to ensure that corrective information can be supplied and any underlying system
fault can be rectified.

It is envisaged that NWB Business Incidents will only be generated by the following
groups within ICL Pathway and POL:

e ICL Pathway / MSU for exceptions reported via the NWB Report Set

e POL TP / BSM for any other reconciliation / settlement error or disputed
transaction discovered by POL that has not been reported by ICL Pathway via the
NWB report set

e ICL Pathway / System Support Centre (SSC) for any system fault or data ‘surgery’
which is considered by ICL Pathway to have a reconciliation or settlement
implication within POL in respect of NWB transactions.

Subject to agreement by the parties to the contrary, Post Office outlet calls to the
Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH) will not generate NWB Business Incidents. However
calls from Post Office outlets will be monitored and if it is considered necessary by ICL
Pathway, difficulties reported to the HSH will be elevated to NWB Business Incident
status.

Business Incidents Raised via the HSH by ICL Pathway / MSU

MSU will raise an appropriate Business Incident via the HSH for all exceptions
appearing on reconciliation report NB102 sections 2,3,4 and 5.

Business Incidents Raised via the HSH by POL

It is important that POL TP / BSM supply sufficient information to the HSH when
generating a NWB Business Incident in respect of a reconciliation or settlement error
to ensure the timescales for the resolution of NWB Business Incidents referred to in
section 6.0 can be achieved. Achievement of such timescales is dependent upon the
following information being provided by POL TP / BSM when generating a NWB
Business Incident via the HSH:

1. A valid ‘PATH’ code must be quoted, e.g. ‘*PATH040’ etc.
2. Prefix all narrative with ‘THIS IS A BUSINESS INCIDENT FOR MSU’

¢ Outlet FAD
¢ Value of transaction

¢ Date of transaction

NB: Where POL TP / BSM raise a NWB Business Incident which may require a large
amount of supporting information, summary detail only may be given to the HSH and
the additional information may be sent via e-mail to ICL Pathway / MSU. (A current
ICL Pathway / MSU contact list will be made available to POL).

4.3.3 Disputed Transactions Raised via the Enquiry Service

This facility is to support requirement NBR260 in respect of disputed transactions
where POL have received notification via either the outlet or the Network Business
Support Centre (NBSC). POL / TP / BSM will contact ICL Pathway / MSU directly
by telephone, requesting urgent investigation within the timescales quoted in section
4.4.3.1

Achievement of such timescales is dependent upon the following information being
provided by POL TP / BSM when generating a disputed transaction enquiry via the
Enquiry Service:
1. A valid ‘PATH’ code must be quoted, e.g. ‘PATH040’ etc.
2. The following transaction detail:

¢ Client Account Number (the PAN)

¢ Outlet FAD

¢ Value of transaction

¢ Date of transaction

NB: If incorrect or insufficient information is provided by POL to ICL Pathway to
allow resolution of the query, no further action will take place until new information
is supplied and the query will not be monitored in accordance with the timescales
referred to in section 4.4.3.1.

NWB Incident Reporting

BIMS Reports / MER

The Business Incident Management System (BIMS) has been designed to report the
progress to resolution of an NWB Business Incident to allow POL / TP to complete an
accurate reconciliation (within POL central systems) or settlement with their clients.
For ease of identification and association with the corresponding HSH call, BIMS
Report references will mimic the HSH reference. However they will be prefixed with a
letter ‘B’, e.g. HSH ref.: E9912120011 = BIMS ref.: BE9912120011. Where an
incident has been raised via the Enquiry Service, an initial response will be provided via
telephone to POL / TP / BSM and followed up by an appropriate BIMS report.

Format & content of BIMS report / MER

ABIMS Report will be issued for each NWB Business Incident generated via the HSH
and the Enquiry Service. As part of that BIMS report, ICL Pathway will issue a MER
for each error associated with the relevant NWB Business Incident where it is
necessary to do so, to advise POL / TP of the transaction detail required to enable
reconciliation or settlement to take place.

BIMS Reports / MER are designed to notify POL / TP of the detail required to assist
in the reconciliation or settlement process within POL / TP. They communicate

information concerning the resolution of the symptom of an underlying cause, not the

cause itself. BIMS Reports / MER will not advise any detail as to the underlying
‘Cause’ of the problem if this is a result of a software error etc. This information is
supplied via the System Incident Log (SIL). Where a System Incident is generated to
eradicate the cause of a particular problem and there are one or more associated NWB
Business Incidents, cross-references will be supplied on the NWB Business Incident
BIMS Report / MER and the SIL to allow tracking of the System Incident.

Clearance & Closure Criteria

ICL Pathway anticipates that it will provide information concerning NWB Business
Incidents to POL / TP on a ‘drip feed’ basis, by issuing updated versions of the initial
BIMS Report / MER.

A BIMS Report is ‘Cleared’ when ICL Pathway / MSU has provided the reconciliation
/ settlement information required to be contained in the relevant BIMS Report as set
out in section 4.4.1.1. Additionally, the exception is cleared from the appropriate
section of NB102 by MSU. The BIMS Report is then ‘Closed’ following agreement
between POL / TP and ICL Pathway / MSU at the monthly TIP Operational Review
Forum (TIPORF). Such agreement is subject only to fulfilment of the following
conditions:

e Ifthere is no associated System Incident, the BIMS Report is closed subject to the
clearance criteria described above being met

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 22/01/02

4.4.1.3

4.4.2

e If there is an associated System Incident, the BIMS Report is closed subject to the
successful closure of the System Incident by ICL Pathway / MSU. (On some
occasions however, it is expected that POL / TP will give authority to close a
BIMS report prior to the closure of the System Incident).

POL / TP will advise [CL Pathway / MSU via spreadsheet on a monthly basis at the
monthly TIPORF of any payments it considers are payable to POL (as compensation
for POL’s costs in dealing with MER) and / or its charges for dealing with widespread
errors. For the avoidance of doubt, NO charges are payable in respect of MER

issued for NWB incidents not affecting the TIP transaction stream.

If the parties disagree whether the TIP transaction stream has been affected or not, this
will be initially discussed at the monthly TIPORF. The specific incidents will then be
escalated via a ‘Case Law Referral’ form, to the Contract Administration Board for a
final decision to be made.

BIMS Report Distribution

ICL Pathway / MSU will distribute NWB BIMS Reports / MER within POL / TP
using the POL corporate e-mail network. In the event that this facility is temporarily
unavailable, reports will be distributed via the ICL Pathway mail system.

BIMS Reports / MER distributed in accordance with this section will be deemed to
have been issued to POL / TP, and / or POL / TP given notice of any errors described
therein, at the time of transmission by mail.

An example of a BIMS Report / MER is shown in Section 5.0.

System Incident Log

The SIL is intended to track the progress to resolution of a System Incident generated
to eradicate an underlying system fault. In practice, one system fault could lead to a
number of symptoms generating NWB Business Incidents. The SIL has been
developed to remove the need to annotate each BIMS Report / MER associated with a
particular system fault, with the detail required to ensure POL / TP are fully advised as
to the nature of this fault and how and when it is to be rectified. This information will
be contained in the SIL. NB: The SIL is not intended to be a vehicle to relay detail
of all ICL Pathway releases / fixes and will relate only to reconciliation incidents
resolved by MSU.

4.4.3 NWB Exception Resolution Timescales

4.4.3.1 NWB Business Incident SLA conditions

ICL Pathway / MSU will raise an initial BIMS Report (V1.0) relating to a new NWB
Business Incident, on the same working day as the NWB Business Incident is
generated via the HSH or the Enquiry Service, or in any event on the morning of the
next working day. This will be made available in accordance with section 4.4.1.1, to
POL / TP. This initial, incomplete, BIMS Report will serve to notify POL that a
Business Incident has occurred and that the completed BIMS Report will be provided
to POL within the agreed timescales below.

In the event of the NWB Report Set not being available to ICL Pathway / MSU in time
to enable any exceptions to be notified within this timescale, ICL Pathway / MSU will
contact the POL / TP ‘Incident Manager Transaction Processing’ to agree a
temporary extension to the timescale.

All enquiries and transaction searches within 90 days of the original transaction date
will be carried out by ICL Pathway / MSU via the DRS Workstation. Enquiries and
transaction searches where the original transaction date is in excess of 90 days will be
carried out by ICL Pathway / MSU using the Audit Archive subject _to POL
agreement to this archive being used for this purpose.

ICL Pathway / MSU will ensure the final cleared BIMS Report / MER, is made
available in accordance with section 4.4.1.1.and is cleared in accordance with the
following timescales:

1. For disputed transaction enquiries relating to system states 8,9,10 & 11 (defined as
“Customer Critical’ exceptions) where the transaction date is within 90 days of

the date the transaction is disputed by the end customer and raised by POL /
TP / BSM via the Enquiry Service in accordance with section 4.3.3:

¢ Ifthe disputed transaction is notified BY THE END of the MSU day where an
exception appears within NB102 section 5 — i.e. the day following receipt by
the DRS of a transaction within system states 8,9,10 or 11:

It must be resolved within an average time of <= 8 hours of notification,
based upon all Customer Critical exceptions received within a monthly
reporting period.

e If the disputed transaction is notified AFTER THE END of the MSU day
where an exception appears within NB102 section 5 — i.e. the day following
receipt by the DRS of a transaction within system states 8,9,10 or 11:

It must be resolved within an average time of <= 8 hours commencing at
08.00hrs on the SECOND MSU day following receipt by the DRS of the
exception, based upon all Customer Critical exceptions received within a
monthly reporting period.

section 4.3.1:

e It must be resolved within an average time of <= 8 hours commencing at
08.00hrs on the SECOND MSU day following receipt by the DRS of the
exception, based upon all Customer Critical exceptions received within a
monthly reporting period.

For ALL other NWB exceptions reported within NB102 sections 1 — 5 and raised
via the HSH by ICL Pathway / MSU in accordance with section 4.3.1:

¢ They must be resolved within 5 MSU days of notification via NB102 sections
1-5.

For ALL NWB reconciliation errors raised by POL / TP / BSM via the HSH in
accordance with section 4.3.2:

e They must be resolved within 5 MSU days from the date they were reported
to the HSH.

NB: All time is calculated using the MSU day (08.00 to 17.30) and Monday to Friday
inclusive, excluding English bank holidays.

SLA Exclusions

Where an exception is identified as having it’s root cause outside of the ICL
Pathway domain the exception will be removed from the SLA calculation and
resolved using ‘Reasonable Endeavours’.

Where an exception has been generated due to factors outside of ICL Pathway’s
control, e.g. where an outlet has failed to communicate due to fire, flooding or
other agreed ‘Force Majeur’ conditions, the exception will be removed from the
SLA calculation and resolved using ‘Reasonable Endeavours’.

NWB System Incident Resolution Timescales

There is no strict timescale for the resolution of a System Incident as the time taken to
develop a fix or correct erroneous reference data cannot be determined. Obviously
however, ICL Pathway will give every System Incident the priority it deserves taking
into account POL’s requirement and would aim to deliver an initial analysis of the root
cause within 5 working days and a final analysis and evidence of remedial action,
within 10 working days. A System Incident will be closed by ICL Pathway once the
relevant fix has been developed and tested, or a correction to the relevant erroneous
reference data has been authorised or approved for release through the appropriate
agreed procedures between ICL Pathway and POL. The SIL, advising the current
status of System Incidents will be delivered to POL / TP at the end of each week. POL
/ TP may telephone ICL Pathway / MSU at any time to receive an update as to the
status of any System Incident documented on the SIL.

Widespread Errors

ICL Pathway will monitor ‘trigger points’, for example HSH calls and the NWB
Report set, which can alert of any likely potential or actual ‘widespread’ errors which
may occur. This is generally agreed to be the case where at least 100 exceptions of the
same System State are reported within NB102 sections 2,3,4 & 5. In such a case, a
problem will be raised and passed from ICL Pathway into the POL business
community.

Should this scenario occur, ICL Pathway Business Continuity Manager will
immediately notify POL Business Continuity Manager of the widespread error. Upon
giving such notice the provisions of this document (other than this section) shall cease
to apply to that particular widespread error. Instead, a recovery plan applicable to the
specific nature of the error will be agreed by both parties.

Repairing Data

Refer to ICL Pathway document ‘CS/PRO/II1 ‘TPS Reconciliation & Incident
Management’ for the repair criteria in relation to NWB transactions affecting the TPS
transaction stream.
