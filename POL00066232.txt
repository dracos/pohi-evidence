“GRO.

I am required to disclose to you any prosecution material which has not previously been disclosed and which might reasonably be

considered capable of undermining the Prosecution case against the accused or of assisting the case for the accused

At this stage there is no prosecution material which meets the above test.

Attached to this letter is a copy of a Schedule of Non-Sensitive Unused Material.

Ifyou supply a written Defence Statement to me the material will be further reviewed in the light of that statement.

In the event of a conviction the Prosecution will make application for Confiscation. I therefore enclose a statement requesting provision of

financial information in accordance with Section 18 Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, for inclusion with your papers.

Yours faithfully
