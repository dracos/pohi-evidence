POLB 14154              NETWORK AND SALES

                (a)     The Board received an update on the progress of Network
                        Transformation, discussions with the NFSP and Crown
                        Transformation, together with an update on Project Ivy.

                (b)      NETWORK TRANSFORMATION
                        The Board discussed the costs of onsite and offsite conversions and
                        the impact on sales. Kevin Gilliland explained that because of the
                        change of premises, offsite conversions were understandably taking
                        longer to. recover lost sales as a result of the change than onsite
                        conversions. The Business was trialling different initiatives to support
                        the new branches and he was very hopeful that this would improve the
                        sales. However, even with the initial loss of sales these branches
                        increased the profitability for the Post Office because of the savings in
                        fixed costs. The big opportunity for these branches was their
                        availability outside core Post Office hours and the Business needed to
                        promote that more effectively, as well as provide the right products
                        such as collections and returns.
ACTION: Kevin   (c)     The Board asked for a further update on the economics of
Gilliland               transformed branches (onsite versus offsite) as part of the quarterly
                        Network update.

                (d)     Kevin Gilliland explained that, despite the success of hitting both the
                        number of contracts signed and branches open targets for 2013/14,
                        there was still considerable risk in this year's target as the majority.of
                        both contract signatures and openings would be Locals, particularly
                        onsite independent Locals, where this approach was largely untested
                        and could potentially take longer to deliver. He reported that he was
                        also working with the NFSP on a trial of 'guided leavers' using a
                        representative sample of 50 subpostmasters to show how we will
                        manage compulsory exits.

                (e)     CROWNS
                        Kevin Gilliland explained that the Business was now very clear about
                        the run rate required at March 2015 to deliver the target of a
                        breakeven Crown network. He stressed that the main risk to delivery
                        was the income line in the P&L, which required a 7% increase year on
                        year.

                (f)     The Board recognised the ambition in the plans and asked the
                        Business to work on a contingency to cover the risk of not achieving
ACTION: CFO             the income target. The CFO explained that work was already
                                                                                           POL00021524
                                                                                      POL00021524




                       Post Office Limited — Strictly Confidential


                         underway and a plan would be in place by the end of the first quarter.
                         The Board asked for sight of the work to date at the May meeting

                 (g)     Chris Day reported that this methodology for calculating the exit run
                         rate for Crowns and therefore the breakeven point had been agreed
                         with BIS.

                 (h)     PROJECT IVY
                         The Board noted the updates and the next steps for Project Ivy.

                 (i)     Martin George and Kevin Gilliland left the meeting.

POLB 14/55               HORIZON -- DELOITTE REPORT

                 (a)     The Board welcomed Lesley Sewell, Chief Information Officer, and
                         Gareth James, Partner, Deloitte, to the meeting. Chris Aujard also re-
                         joined the meeting.

                 (b)     The Chairman thanked Gareth James for his draft report and
                         explained that there were a number of people who were sceptical
                         about Horizon. The Board were concerned to know the truth about
                         the reliability of the system. Deloitte's views would need to be
                         expressed in such a way that they would persuade reasonable lay
                         people.

                 (c)     Lesley Sewell explained that the first piece of work Deloitte had been
                         asked to undertake was to give assurance that the control framework,
                         including the security and processes for changes in the system, were
                         robust from an IT perspective.

                 (d)     Gareth James reported that all the work to date showed that the
                         system had strong areas of control and that its testing and
                         implementation were in line with best practice. Work was still needed
                         to assure the controls and access at the Finance Service Centre.

                 (e)     Chris Aujard explained that several of the subpostmasters who were
                         challenging Horizon had made allegations about 'phantom'
                         transactions which were non-traceable. Assurance from Deloitte about
                         the integrity of the system records logs would be very valuable.

ACTION:          (f)     The Board asked what assurance could be given pre 2010 when the
Lesley Sewell!           different Horizon system was in use. It was agreed that Gareth James
Chris Aujard             would produce and cost a proposal for additional work to enable
                         assurance for the wider system, including pre 2010.

                 (g)     Lesley Sewell, Gareth James and Chris Aujard left the meeting.

POLB 14/56               CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REPORT

                 (a)     The Board noted the Chief Executive's report.

                 (b)     The CEO reported that an employee engagement score of 57% had
                         been achieved for the full year, which meant that the Business had
                         achieved its stretch target.
