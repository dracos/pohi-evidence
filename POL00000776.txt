Abstract
This document:
e was jointly produced by ICL Pathway and POCL;

e was reviewed, validated and approved by the APS Reconciliation
Panel;

e describes the results of work carried out during the period
January 1999 to April 1999;

e focuses on:

e observed APS exceptions which could affect the accounting
processes carried out within post office outlets and POCL
central functions;

e the local resolution of exceptions;

e the raising of incidents when exceptions cannot be resolved
locally;

¢ resolution of the incidents.

Exceptions may be caused by user error, reference data error,
hardware failure, communications failure or software error.

Process definitions for EPOSS reconciliation and reference data error
management are detailed in separate documents (see associated
documents in section 0.3). This document concentrates on APS
transactions carried out at Horizon enabled post offices using
release NR2 software.

This document includes all APS reconciliation related exceptions
which have been identified to date and the planned method of
handling them. It is recognised that other incidents may arise
during live trial. If any new unexpected incidents occur in the
future they will be investigated by the appropriate authorities and
the relevant processes will be amended to accommodate the new
incident types.

Validation and reconciliation of APS data is carried out at a number
of points within the APS process chain - see appendix A for detail.
Validation and reconciliation may highlight exceptions. Exceptions
may be resolved locally within the outlet or central POCL
organisations. Exceptions which cannot be resolved locally are
raised as incidents with the appropriate helpdesk. At release NR2
Horizon enabled outlets will be supported by two help desks, i.e.
the existing ICL Pathway Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH) and the
new POCL Network Business Support Centre (NBSC). A set of
principles are included in this document which describe the scope of
each help desk and the key help desk interactions at NR2.

Within this document exceptions and incidents that are directly
related to APS accounting reconciliation are described in detail.

Principles for Automated Payment
Recon tion Incident Management and
Resolution

The following principles were used in the development of the
Release NR2 APS end-to-end reconciliation process. Changes to the
principles may necessitate the review and revision of the processes
detailed within this document.

Note 1: Within this document the term “exception” is used to
describe an exceptional situation that occurs locally within an outlet
or within the POCL TP (Transaction Processing) organisation.

Note 2: Within this document an “incident” is deemed to have
occurred when an exceptional situation is reported to and recorded
by either the ICL Pathway HSH (Horizon System Helpdesk), the
POCL NBSC (Network Business Support Centre) or the Incident
Management Point within POCL TP.

Note 3: The general principles below include the initial handling of
reference data errors because there is a significant interaction
between reference data and APS system functionality. In
exceptional circumstances an incident may be initially thought to be
a POCL reference data error but later found to be an error within the
ICL Pathway domain. It is also possible that an incident may
initially be thought to have been caused by an error within the ICL
Pathway domain but later found to be a POCL reference data error.
Both these situations require secondary routing of the initial
incident. Details of this is provided within the Reference Data Error
Management process - ref. CS/PRD/046.

5.1 APS Reconciliation Process Design Principles

P1 Outlets will, wherever possible, eliminate user errors before
raising an incident.

NR2 - Incident Management &
Resolution

Date. 16/06/99

P2 POCL TP Incident Management will, wherever possible, eliminate
human error and errors within POCL systems before raising an
incident with ICL Pathway.

P3 Wherever possible, APS related incidents that have accounting
reconciliation implications will be predefined so that they can be
easily identified and routed to the correct resolution point.

P4 For each predefined incident category there will be an agreed
“initial incident management contact point”. In the case of
outlets this will either be the ICL Pathway HSH or the POCL
NBSC. Outlets will not be advised to contact both. In the case
of POCL TP the initial contact point will be POCL TP Incident
Management.

P5 Incidents reported to the HSH that are defined as “APS
Predefined Business Incidents”, indicating that there are ICL
Pathway reconciliation implications, will be routed to the ICL
Pathway BSU (Business Support Unit). A category of “new” will
be used for unexpected incidents that are shown to have APS
reconciliation implications. Following investigation, valid new
incidents will be added to the list of APS Predefined Business
Incidents.

P6 The BSU will investigate APS predefined business incidents and
report findings on an APS RED (Reconciliation Exception
Database) Report.

P7 APS RED reports will be distributed to a defined single point
within POCL.

P8 POCL will define a single point for the receipt of APS RED
reports.

PQ Outlets will be advised to report detected Horizon system
hardware or communications incidents directly to the ICL
Pathway HSH.

P10 Outlets will be advised to report incidents that are likely to have
been caused by a Horizon system software error directly to the
ICL Pathway HSH.

P11(a) Outlets will be advised to report incidents that are likely to
have been caused by an error in the POCL reference data
(regardless of where the source of the error actually is) error
directly to the POCL NBSC.

P11(b) Outlets will be advised to report incidents that are likely to
have been caused by an error in the ICL Pathway reference data
(regardless of where the source of the error actually is) directly
to the HSH.

P12 In situations where an incident could have been caused by
either a POCL reference data error or a Horizon system software

error, the incident will initially be treated as a potential POCL
reference data error, i.e. incident raised with the POCL NBSC.

P13 In situations where a key outlet business process is impacted
by an unresolved incident of any type, the outlet will be advised
to contact the POCL NBSC for advice and guidance.

P14 ICL Pathway and POCL will work together to ensure that the
advice and guidance information provided by the HSH and the
POCL NBSC is compatible with the knowledge and culture within
the outlet.

P15 Where appropriate, ICL Pathway technical domains will trigger
the raising of an APS predefined business incident, e.g. when an
ICL Pathway technical incident is shown to have caused APS
reconciliation implications.

P16 Where appropriate, the ICL Pathway BSU will trigger the raising
of a technical incident, e.g. when an APS predefined business
incident suggests that there might be an underlying ICL Pathway
software error.

P17 Both the HSH and NBSC will conform to the principles described
above. If an outlet makes a call to the HSH which relates to
P11(a) , P12 or P13, the call will be treated as inappropriate and
the outlet will be advised by the HSH to call the NBSC. If an
outlet makes a call to the NBSC which relates to P9, P10 or
P11(b), the call will be treated as inappropriate and the outlet
will be advised to call the HSH. If either help desk starts
handling a call because it initially appears to be appropriate, but
then finds that it is the responsibility of the other desk, then the
help desk handling the call will inform the outlet that they are
referring the call to the other help desk, terminate the call with
the outlet and inform the other desk. The other desk will
contact the outlet and continue advice and guidance and/or
resolution.

P18 Both the HSH and NBSC will take action to avoid outlets being
passed backwards and forwards between the two help desks. If
when calling a help desk the outlet mentions that they have
already been referred from the other help desk, then the help
desk taking the call second will take control of the call and
interact with the other desk to agree how the incident will be
progressed.

6.1 Summary of Automated Payment Reconciliation
Related Exceptions Identified at Outlets

The following provides a summary of the categories of exception
which may be detected within a post office outlet and the action
taken. Specific exceptions are discussed later in this document.
Exceptions become incidents when they are reported to and
recorded on either the POCL incident management system (TP
Incident Management at Chesterfield or NBSC at Leeds) or the ICL
Pathway HSH. The handling of APS reconciliation related incidents
within POCL and ICL Pathway is described in sections entitled POCL
Incident Management and ICL Pathway Incident Management at the
rear of this document.

6.1.1Impacted Accounting Processes

6.1.4APS Predefined Business Incidents Requiring ICL Pathway
BSU Action

APS reconciliation incidents that require ICL Pathway BSU
involvement in their resolution are known within ICL Pathway as

“APS Predefined Business Incidents”.

When appropriate these incidents are communicated by the outlet
to the ICL Pathway HSH. The handling of APS Predefined Business
Incidents within ICL Pathway is described in the section entitled ICL

Pathway Incident Management at the rear of this document.
incidents of this type are currently identified.

6.1.5 Inappropriate Calls to either the POCL NBSC or the ICL
Pathway HSH

No

If outlets make calls to the ICL Pathway HSH that relate to the
exceptions described in 6.1.1 above or reference data related
exceptions described in 6.1.3 above, the HSH advises the outlet to

contact the NBSC.

If outlets make calls to the NBSC that relate to the exceptions
described in 6.1.2 above, the NBSC advises the outlet to contact the

HSH.

exceptions become incidents when they are reported to and
recorded by the TP Incident Management Point. The TP Incident
Management system is linked with the NBSC at Leeds. Suspected

7.2 Process Descriptions

NB: References 1, 2 and 3 were previously used for BPS processes,
which are now no longer relevant.

Processes 4, , 5 and 6 - Reference data processes

These processes describe how product and outlet reference data is
manage - see ICL Pathway documents CS/PRD/030 (product) and
CS/PRD/050 (outlet). References data error management is
described in CS/PRD/046.

Process 7 - Control APS

Includes the APS functionality provided within the Horizon system -
see ICL Pathway document CS/PRD/044 for further information.

Process 8 - Control OBCS
Includes the OCBS functionality provided within the Horizon system.
Event A - Customer requests service

Includes requests for automated payment and/or EPOSS
transactions. Also includes enquiries relating to automated
payment and/or EPOSS transactions.

Process 9 - Complete customer session (OBCS/APS/EPOSS)

A session comprises one or more OBCS, APS or EPOSS transactions.
Included are transactions completed using the automated features
of the Horizon system, e.g. card reader, bar code reader, receipt
printer, etc.. Also included are transactions completed when
peripheral equipment is temporarily unavailable. In these
situations the outlet enters transaction details via the keyboard,
prepares manual receipts, etc.

An expanded view of the Complete Customer Session process is
provided within this document in section entitled Lower Level
Models.

Further details are available in POCL business process diagrams :
EPOSS - 17/12/8/9/10/11/60/26/27/18

APS - 1/8/16

OBCS - 10/9/11/6/4&5/1&2

Process 10 - Complete customer session (fallback)

If the Horizon system is unavailable, e.g. PC hardware failure, the
outlet reverts to manual operation. The manual receipts and
counter-foils used during fallback are used later when recovery
(process 11) is carried out.

An expanded view of the Complete Customer Process (fallback)
process is provided within this document in section entitled Lower
Level Models.

Event B - Outlet triggers recovery

Transactions completed in fallback need to be entered into the
Horizon system when the system returns to normal operation.
Recovery can be completed as soon as the system is available or
when the user has time to enter the transactions. However,
recovery must be completed before the end of the Cash Account
Period.

Process 11 - Recover fallback transactions

Transactions processed during fallback are entered to the system as
part of the recovery process. AP has a recovery modes for this
purpose. EPOSS transactions are entered in bulk or individually.

An expanded view of the Recover Fallback Transactions process is
provided within this document in section entitled Lower Level
Models.

Further details available in POCL business process diagrams :
Integrated Service - 48
Process 12 - Maintain EPOSS records

The system maintains a log of all the transactions performed in the
outlet which is updated as the transactions are entered to the
system. The transaction log can be accessed at any time to assist
with enquiries or to perform other activities in the stock unit, e.g.
reports, balancing, transaction reversals, etc.

Event C - Automatic end of day marker set

At the end of the trading day (either 30mins after office closing or
7pm) an accounting marker is set which indicates the end of the
trading day for the outlet - see ICL Pathway document CS/PRD/044
for further information.

Process 13 - Manage end of day

The end of day marker indicates the end of the outlet trading day.
The setting of the end of day marker prevents the reversal of
automated payment transactions performed during the day. A
manual end of day activities facility can be selected by the user.
This displays the outstanding mandatory daily activities for the
stock unit.

This process includes the communication of transaction details from
post office outlets to the ICL Pathway correspondence servers,
onward communication to the central ICL Pathway systems and
then on to the POCL TIP and HAPS system interfaces.

An expanded view of the Maintain/Communicate EPOSS and APS
Records process is provided within this document in section entitled
Lower Level Models.

Process 15 - Reconcile and settle

This process includes the receipt of the information which makes up
the Cash Account, validation against volume/value and storage for
various purposes (e.g. RMMI (Royal Mail Management Information)).
When the full week’s data has been received it is then reported to
CBDB.

TIP receives the cash declaration from the outlets which forms part
of the snapshot balance and supports the information which
appears on the Cash Account. TIP does not receive daily/weekly
reports or stock unit balances. TIP only receives the outlet cash
account.

TIP also receives STX records which are stock holdings per item on
hand at the end of the accounting week. The information is used to
reconcile and settle with each client.

The information is received on a daily basis (between 8.00am and
15.00) by File Transfer Protocol (FTP) from the gateway PC.

An expanded view of the Reconcile and Settle process is provided
within this document in section entitled Lower Level Models.

Process 16 - Consolidate and reconcile automated payment
records

AP transactions accepted at the outlet are polled on a daily basis
after the end of day marker has been set. The information is sent
via HAPS to Farnborough who sort the data into clients. The
information is forwarded to settlements so that payment can be
made to the client.

Further details are available in POCL business process diagrams :
APS - 3

The information received from Farnborough updates APACHI and is
compared to the entry on cash account by outlet. Discrepancies
discovered are investigated and corrected within Transaction
Processing.

See ICL Pathway document CS/PRD/044 for further information.

Resolution

POCL clients receive automated payment transaction information
from Farnborough. Clients use this information to support
settlement processes.

Event D - End of trading day

The end of the trading day for a user/stock unit usually occurs at
completion of the daily shift.

Process 18 - Complete daily cash declaration

The cash on hand is declared to the Horizon system, on a daily
basis, for reporting purposes, at the end of the user/stock unit
trading day.

An expanded view of the Complete Daily Cash Declaration process
is provided within this document in section entitled Lower Level
Models.

Further details are available in the POCL business process
diagrams :

EPOSS - 38
Event E - Daily despatch of product reports required

Documents accepted during the trading day into the stock unit are
despatched internally within POCL and externally to POCL clients.

Process 19 - Complete daily reports

At the agreed time for the outlet, each stock unit produces the
mandatory daily reports. The user checks that the report agrees
with the actual documents, amends if necessary and despatches
the documents with the supporting report.

An expanded view of the Complete Daily Reports process is
provided within this document in section entitled Lower Level
Models.

Further details are available in the POCL business process
diagrams :

EPOSS - 35&36/56&57
Event F - Weekly despatch of product reports required

Documents which are not despatched daily are sent on a weekly
basis when the cash account has been produced.

Process 20 - Complete weekly reports

Each stock unit produces the reports to support the documents (as
process 18). Some products also require an outlet report which is a
summary of all the stock unit reports.

An expanded view of the Complete Weekly Reports process is
provided within this document in section entitled Lower Level

Event G - End of balance period for stock unit

On transfer of accountability of a stock unit or at the end of the
cash account period (CAP) all stock units have to be balanced.

Process 21 and 22 - Balance stock unit and roll-over

The purpose of balancing is to assess the state of the stock unit by
confirming the entries on the Horizon system against the
documents, cash and stock on hand. Once the user confirms that
the balance is accurate the stock unit is rolled into the next BP or
CAP depending on what is required by the user/outlet. The impact
of rolling the stock unit removes the transaction information from
the stock unit, carrying forward the cash and stock on hand to the
next accounting period.

Stock units may be individual stock units or shared stock units.

is provided within this document in section entitled Lower Level
Models.

Further details are available in the POCL business process
diagrams :

EPOSS - 37/59/39/58
Event H - End of cash account period

The cash account is a summary of all the transactions performed
within the outlet during the accounting week and a declaration of
cash and stock on hand at the close of the accounting period. The
accounting period is usually one week and the account is therefore
produced weekly.

Process 23, 24, 25 and 26 - Balance cash account and roll
over

The cash account is an amalgamation of all the stock unit balances
for the outlet. When the cash account is completed and produced
the outlet moves forward to the next cash account period (CAP).

Cash accounts usually cover one week. However, by exception
cash accounts may cover two or three weeks. A final cash account
is produced when an outlet changes ownership or when an outlet is
temporarily or permanently closed. An initial cash account is used
when an outlet migrates to the Horizon system.

An expanded view of the Balance Cash Account and Roll-over
process is provided within this document in section entitled Lower
Level Models.

8.11 Maintain Payment Records (POCL Clients) - Process

17 on End-to-end Model

This section is included for completeness. The processes used by
POCL clients are not affected by the introduction of Release NR2.

POCL clients compare transaction level information provided by
POCL with settlement information. If there are differences the POCL
client would raise a query with the POCL Error Management Team in
Chesterfield. Valid queries would trigger an adjustment to
settlement. This is shown in section 9.12.1 (expansion of process
15) where client queries are received by process 15.3 (manage
errors) and error notifications are sent to process 15.2 (settle with
clients). Valid POCL client queries would lead to an incident being
raised by POCL TP Incident Management. If the POCL investigation
showed that the incident was caused by an underlying error within
the ICL Pathway domain, then POCL TP Incident Management would
raise an incident with the ICL Pathway HSH.

In addition. a customer could raise a query with a POCL client if a
difference was observed between their personal records and the
bill/statement provided by the POCL client. If an investigation by
the POCL client indicated that the root cause was within the POCL
domain, then the POCL client would raise an incident with the POCL
Error Management Team in Chesterfield. The process would then
progress as described in the paragraph above.

9 POCL Incident Management and Resolution
Processes for Automated Payment Related
Incidents

At release NR2 automated payment incidents are handled by four
organisations:

« NBSC (Leeds)

e TP Incident Management Point (Chesterfield) linked to the NBSC
e OSG (Farnborough)

« POITS (Farnborough)

The NBSC provides advice and guidance for business issues, e.g. for
situations where outlet business process are impacted by an
unresolved incident of any type. The NBSC also handles reference
data related incidents raised by outlets or POCL TP.

The TP Incident Management Point records incidents occurring
within TP and raises incidents with the ICL Pathway HSH or the
NBSC.

OSG reports incidents to HSH that have occurred during file transfer
across the HAPS interface - normal POCL hours.

POITS report incidents to HSH that have occureed during file
transfer across the HAPS interface - outside normal POCL hours.

When the system is down at end of day the
outlet must complete manual versions of the

the service, the outlet must, if applicable,
recover those transactions necessary and
complete a system summary and cut off. This
system produced summary can then be
discarded.

Weekly Summaries

As part of the fallback process for Cash
Account production, the outlet in the case of
system / power failure will not be required to

week. In this Scenario, no weekly reports will
be required.

Resolution

The vast majority of automated payment related incidents handled
by ICL Pathway concern the operation of the APS service, e.g.
Horizon system advice and guidance, hardware incidents,
communications incidents, software incidents. These types of
incidents do not normally have accounting reconciliation
implications.

The main focus of this section is the management of incidents that:
e have accounting reconciliation implications;
e require ICL Pathway BSU involvement in resolution.

The preceding diagram shows four categories of incidents. Each of
these is discussed below.

10.1.1 Automated Payment predefined business incidents

Wherever possible automated payment incidents that involve
reconciliation of accounting information by the BSU are predefined
so that they can be easily separated from other incidents, clearly
labelled and routed to the BSU by the most direct route. Within ICL
Pathway, automated payment incidents that have accounting
reconciliation implications are referred to as “AP Predefined
Business Incidents”. These incidents include a category of “other”
which can be used if new unexpected incidents are encountered.
Following investigation and resolution, the new incident is added to
the list of predefined business incidents so that it can be dealt with
effectively if/when it is encountered again.

Predefined business incidents may be reported to the HSH by post
office outlets, POCL TP incident management or ICL Pathway
organisations. The HSH routes predefined business incidents to the
BSU via the SMC.

All predefined business incidents are added to the RED
(Reconciliation Exception Database) by the BSU. The BSU
investigates the incident and reports findings via a RED report.

10.1.2 General Horizon system advice and guidance,
hardware, communications, software and file transfer
related incidents

These incidents form the majority of incidents handled by the HSH.
Incidents are either resolved by the HSH during the initial call, e.g.
Horizon system advice and guidance, or routed to the appropriate
technical expert domain for resolution. The SMC filters known
errors.

Advice and guidance associated with the operation of the Horizon
system is provided by the HSH at the request to post office outlets.
Hardware, comms. and software incidents associated with the
counter systems are reported by the post office outlet directly to
the HSH.

During normal POCL hours incidents associated with the operation
of HAPS interface are reported to the HSH by POCL OSG
(Farnborough). Outside normal POCL hours incidents associated
with the HAPS interface are reported to the HSH by POITS.

10.1.3 Reference data errors

Post office outlet queries relating to prices, product information, and
other POCL reference data type information are initially handled by
the POCL NBSC. The NBSC checks reference data and resolves any
errors that have occurred within POCL domain. If POCL perceive
that the reference data error was caused by an underlying error
within the ICL Pathway domain, the NBSC raises a reference data
incident with the HSH. The HSH routes the incident to the SMC
where checks are made to see if the error was cause by a “transient
known error” e.g. late delivery of reference data or a
communications problems. If this does not explain why a reference
data incident has occurred the incident is routed to the ICL Pathway
technical domain (System Support Centre) for further investigation.
The further investigation, where appropriate, involves the ICL
Pathway Reference Data Team. A detailed description is provided in
ICL Pathway process definition document CS/PRD/046.

10.1.4 BSU raised system incidents

The BSU raise a system incident with the HSH if they perceive that
a specific system error has occurred. They raise a problem is a
trend is observed.

10.2Inappropriate calls from outlets

The HSH will consider the following calls to be inappropriate:

¢ calls relating to situations where a key outlet business processes,
e.g. cash account rollover, is impacted by an incident of any
type;

e calls relating to price, product or other POCL reference data type
queries.

The HSH will advise the outlet to contact the NBSC.

NB: If the HSH starts to provide advice and guidance to an outlet or
starts to diagnose an incident raised by an outlet, but then
discovers that it is an incident that is normally dealt with by the
NBSC, the HSH will inform the outlet that it is referring the incident
to the NBSC, terminate the call with the outlet and inform the NBSC.

Reconciliation:

This action depends on the
customer’s attitude to checking
transactions. If checking takes place
the customer will effectively be
reconciling payment against receipt.

Validation:

An ICL Pathway system event will
occur if individual harvested
information cannot be written to the
Oracle tables within the ICL
Pathway host systems. The event
will trigger a system incident and
this will be investigated to determine
why the exception occurred. If the
investigation concludes that it will
not be possible to process some
individual transaction data, e.g.
because it has been corrupted, then
an “APS Predefined Business
Incident” will be raised and passed
to the ICL Pathway Business Support
Unit. The BSU will investigate and
issue a RED report to POCL.

To step 13 on
next page

The APS transaction file is tested

for integrity, i.e. file structure
correct, header and footer correct
size. This ensures that the file

is suitable for transfer to POCL.
(similar integrity checks are

carried out within POCL when the
file is received. Any exceptions are
handled via ICL Pathway operational

and incident management procedures.

Reconciliation:

Any differences between the two
data streams are reported to the
ICL Pathway Business Support
Unit the next day. Differences
may not affect the accounting
information, e.g. exceptional
timing differences which are
“self-correcting”. If this is not
the case, then the BSU raises
and progresses an “APS,
Predefined Business Incident”.
The BSU will issue a RED
report to POCL.

Validation:

The integrity of APS transaction
files is pre-validated - see step 9
above.

Validation:

The receiving PC retums OK or
error files. Error files are handled
via ICL Pathway operational and
system incident management
procedures. System incident
management and resolution
processes ensure the APS data is
correctly transferred to POCL.
Any records with incorrect client
IDs are returned in the OK files.
