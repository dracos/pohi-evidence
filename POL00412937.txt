Dear all,

Hope you are well.

Veronica has asked me to review the current board biographies as on our corporate website and within our standard
induction pack to ensure these are up-to-date. These are reviewed every six months alongside the rest of the
induction pack to ensure they are up-to-date and readily available as required.

Please can you review your bio and let me know if there are any changes that are required?
Many thanks in advance. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Best wishes,
Rebecca

(Please note that I have emailed Lisa separately).
