,
Thank you for your letter of 2 July 2014, which reached my office this morning.

I understand your reticence about reporting anything further to MPs than is covered by the
Annex to your letter. I will circulate this to the group who will, I suspect, be disappointed
that no further news can be offered.

What I propose to write to them via email is as follows:

“I had hoped that we could schedule a meeting before surnmer during which the Post Office
might offer us an update on how the mediation scheme is progressing. To this end I have
been in correspondence with Paul Vennells, the Chief Executive. I attach an update from her
office, which I have just received.

It appears that not a great deal can be added to what was said in our last meeting. I see no
point in trying to push for a meeting which offers no further detail than we heard at the last.

I understand and am concerned that the investigations and reviews are taking longer than
any of us anticipated. It is possible (though I have not been told so) that the Post Office
considers that nothing can be said about any individual case until something can be said
about all of them. Perhaps there is a risk in the mind of Sir Anthony Hooper that to release
the result of one case might create pressure on another.

intend to press the Post Office on this point, to reconfirm the need to give us all some
substantial information, and to come back to you with a further update in September.

Thope you might be content with this approach.”

I plan on sending this at the end of this week. If you would like to suggest any
amendments, could you do so by close of play Thursday 10 July please?
