Jessica/ Chris

Having looked at the papers . I have no doubt this is the correct decision not to disclosure "Officer Reports”.

If in the case of Hamilton officers report had been disclosured , this would have been extremely dangerous approach.
In the Hamilton case, in the officers report the investigation officer said “Having analysed the Horizon print out and
accounting documentation ,I was unable to find any evidence of theft ,or cash in hand figures been deliberately
inflated”.

In the absence of a file to demonstrate how the case developed ,as it was further investigated ,this would give the
applicant and second sight every opportunity to ask why in fact Hamilton was prosecuted.

In the absence of paper work to deal with this ,this would in turn cause POL difficulties.

All

Having discussed this with Chris and Jessica, the protocol for the use of "Officer Reports" (or as otherwise described) by
Project Sparrow investigators when responding to individual complaints is:

1. The report is NOT to be exhibited OR expressly referenced in Post Office's formal response to a complaint.

2. It can be used by the investigator to help them understand what happened in a particular case, and to identify other
documents relevant to the case (e.g. transcripts of interviews, branch account records etc).

3. If the report is the ONLY source document still available, the investigator can repeat material from the report
(provided it is not legally privileged), but CANNOT cite the report as a reference.

4. Any challenge received about the source of a Post Office statement made from the report must be referred to Chris.

I hope that is clear and reflects the decision made. Please let me know if not.

I anticipate Chris is the best person to make a decision on this point on behalf of POL.

Are allegations POL has NOT properly investigated being made generally or in specific cases?. One of the dangers of
investigation officers report being disclosed is that it will always be easy for the applicant to think of something not
specifically referred to in the report and allege that POL investigation has not been sufficiently through or adequate. Of
course it is highly unlikely that the investigation will have been deficient, but in the absence of full set of papers it may
become impossible for POL to rebut such new allegations.

Thanks Jarnail - There are two cases that are currently affected by this issue. They both urgently need to be cleared and
sent to Second Sight so how would you like to take this forward to a decision?

Kind regards

Chris/ Jessica

As I understand it, POL has been advised by senior counsel that investigation and offender report should not be
disclosed. It is of course matter for POL to make a decision whether

to accept this advice or not and of course it would be open for POL to decide to discourse such documents.

I personally would be unhappy for such documents to be disclosure for reasons set out in counsel Harry Bowyers advice
note.

Given the email correspondence between Bond Dickinson and cartwright King, I would be grateful if I could be informed
whether POL has made a decision or Bond Dickinson are proceeding along the disclosure route without POL having
made a decision.

P.S I will forward Andrew Parsons email to CK sent on 6/5/14 at 15.38.

Thanks

Thanks — if you could mark on the docs any bits that you would prefer to be redacted that would be great.

Hi Andy,

Thank you for your e-mail; It would appear that Harry Bowyer looked at an earlier version of the
proposed response sometime ago and before we were asked to suggest amendments on draft
responses using Track Changes. In those circumstances I have added comment to the latest version of
the proposed response which I have attached hereto.

Whilst we have advised that as a matter of principle investigation and offender type reports should
not be disclosed, I understand that there will be cases in which it is felt that there is no alternative
other than to disclose these. In such circumstances they should be appropriately redacted. If you
would like me to deal with that, please let me know.

The disclosure of redacted reports may lead to requests for the disclosure of such reports in other
cases.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you wish to discuss.

Kind regards,

Martin.
