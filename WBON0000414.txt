Would you be able to collate all the CQRs for the Post Office cases below? They should all be saved in individual
case folders on filesite as pdfs. We don't need the appendices or evidence packs that go with the CQRs — just the

CQRs themselves?

Timeframe is midday tomorrow. Shout if not possible.

I've got 3 paralegals lined up and ready to start tomorrow morning. Aim is to get the job completed this week. Have
you managed to liberate the list of 107 cases from POL's IT system?!

Subject: Request for help in respect of the Chairman's report: Subject to Legal Privilege
Importance: High

Hi Andy,
I just tried to call but went through to your voicemail so, in the first instance, I thought I would send you a note.

As I think you are aware, the Chairman has now received the report from Jonathan Swift QC. This report contains a
number of recommendations, including for us to:

“cross reference specific complaints about misleading advice from NBSC call-handlers with the possible employees
who provided that advice and consider their personnel files, where available, for evidence as to the likelihood that
the complaint may be well founded”.

Our proposal to address this, as agreed with Jonathan, is for those Applicants who raised complaints in respect of
helpline:

¢ Identify those who have particularised their complaint e.g. given a specific date
e Cross reference these calls against the call handler who would have taken the call

eCheck these call handlers PDRs to see if they had had any complaints made against them, in respect of the
advice they were providing.

Where we need your help, or rather your team of paralegal’s, is for them to trawl through the 107 cases that make
complaints in respect of the helpline (see column N of the attached spread sheet) and identify those which have
actually made particularised complaints rather than just generic ones.

As this is for the Chairman, we would like this done ASAP. When do you think you would be able to provide this
analysis by?

Mark
