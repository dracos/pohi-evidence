1 Introduction

As part of Customer Services, the Support Services Management has
responsibility for ensuring that the change control mechanism for releasing
software into the client's (PON) live environment is carried out in a
professional manner.

This document sets out the Release Management Processes that are in
place in order to support the smooth and efficient migration of software from
inception to installation in the live customer environment.

2 Scope

The scope of this document includes all processes associated with Software
Release Management. Types of software release items include:

e major releases

e maintenance releases

¢ approved CPs

e live PinICLs

e  pre-live PinICLs

¢ icons

The range of the processes extends from the management of scheduling an
item for release, to the management of distribution of the item.

The context of the Release Management Processes is defined within the
document CS/QMS/002 ICL Pathway Customer Services Process Manual.
The process is referred to as CS4 Release Management.

Peter Burden

Process

An item is received from Pathway Change Management, Pathway
Development TDA or from Pathway Incident Management. Each of these will
provide all known details of the change required. The item is put forward to
either the CCB or the CSRM forums in order to discuss and approve. Once
the item has been approved by either of these forums, the item is scheduled.

Since Release Management is part of this forum, they are in effect receiving
advance notification of which item will be coming in and when. The item is
passed on to be developed, unit tested and link tested. The relevant software
is taken out of the appropriate store and updated. Once this has been
completed, they pass on details of the item, testing results and issues list on
to the testing area and also to Release Management. The new version of
software is stored. At the same time, they update the status of the item,
thereby informing Release Management that an item is about to be tested.

The item is retrieved from store and testing is carried out. Release
Management is informed of any progress made. This progress is discussed
with Release Management. Issues that arise are dealt with by Release
Management who escalates the issue if necessary. Release Management
also keep the client, PON , informed of progress on the release. Testing also
keep the client (PON) informed of testing progress. Once the testing has
been completed and Release Management is happy with the outcome,
Release Management approves the release for live and the item is free to be
distributed.

Details of the release are passed on to the relevant sources for distribution
and the software is retrieved from the store.

Process

Advance notification is received that an item will be tested. The item is
monitored before it comes into the testing environment so that advance
notification can be received of any issues and resolutions reached.
Development passes on any information relating to progress of the item.
Monitoring in advance ensures that all the components are present before
receiving them.

Once Testing (B & T C and/or OTT) receive the release, the item is checked
to ensure that the item has been developed and tested. The quality of the
item is checked to see if 95% of the tests have been completed successfully.
If this is the case, then the release is accepted for testing. A list of
outstanding issues and a list of dependencies are also passed over to
Testing (B&TC). Details of the testing are drawn up and passed on to
Release Management. Items provided are timescales, lead times, Service
Level Agreements, data, platform/code/ migration plan and installation plan.

Any advance notification of issues that Release Management has received is
passed back to testing. An acknowledgement of acceptance is passed on to
Development. There are several test streams in place, each of which is set
off in a staggered time frame. Testing (B & T C and/or OTT) provide Release
Management with progress reports during the testing phase. Any changes
that arise from reporting progress are actioned by Testing (B & T C and/or
OTT) where applicable.

Depending on the complexity of the item to be tested the following tests are
carried out, when appropriate to the item being released:

e Business Integration
e Integrity and VolumeTest

e Release Migration Test

The document DE/PRO/003 sets out in details the procedures that take place
at lower levels.

For major releases, there are occasions when the client may wish to witness
the testing of the item. A separate test stream is set up for them. Where they
do not wish to be so directly involved, Testing (B & T C and/or OTT) provides
feedback and testing information to the client (PON).

Once the tests have been completed, the item is formally handed over to
Release Management. The handover entails passing over issues, risk log,
history of the item. Support to CS continues until the item is live.

Pat Lywood

Process

The notification of approved for live is sent out so that the release can be
distributed if the item is to be applied at the data centres. If the item requires
software changes to be implemented, the item is sent to ISD data centres.
Once the item has been successfully installed in live they close the Release
Note and send it back to Release Management.

If the item requires changes to be rolled out to all the Post Office Counters,
then the item is sent to SMC for distribution. A pilot is run on approximately
50 counters to ensure that there are no significant problems. Once the pilot
rollout has been completed successfully, then the rest of the counters are
rolled out. SMC consider a successful rollout to be when there are no calls
the following day regarding the new change. The Release Note is closed and
sent back to Release Management, who then close the item.

If the rollout is not successful, then a regression may take place. Customer
Support after the 24 hour period is carried out by SSC, who contact Release
Management to inform them of what has occurred and another related Pin
ICL is raised to correct the fault that was found, which is then managed
through normal incident management procedures.

Process

Advance notification is received that an item will be released in the future.
Advance notification is also passed on to Release Management from
Development that they have completed the work on the item. The item details
are provided once the item has been developed, unit tested and link tested.
Any issues surrounding the release are discussed and resolved. Any
information that is needed in order to carry out the planning of the delivery is
requested from Testing (B &TC and/or OTT). They provide timescales, plans
for major releases and schedules.

For major releases, Release Management also monitor the progress of the
item as it is being developed.

Changes are received from the monitoring process that may impact the
original plan and may cause it to be updated. The release is monitored
through the testing phase and any issues arising are escalated. The
escalation process will cause items to be rejected, deferred or a cross
referred PinICL to be raised. The client, PON, is kept informed of any
progress that is made on the release. When the release is formally approved
for live, they are notified.

Once the item has been approved for live, the item is passed on to be
distributed. If required to provide additional feedback to the client for
publishing a news item, then this information is present in weekly and daily
standard scheduled reporting to the client, PON. Notification is sent to
Broadcast on Counter Comms so that they can co-ordinate timings of the text
to be published.

The release is open until the item has been released into the live
environment. The Release Note is then sent back to Release Management,
who are then able to close the item. Limited monitoring of progress continues
in cases of phased rollouts to Post Office Counters.

An approved CP comes directly from the CCB and must be implemented.
Others that are discussed in the Release Management Forum and can be
rejected and re-submitted at a later date.

Advance notification of the item is given through the regular meeting of the
CSRM. Release Management monitor the receipt of items. An approved CP
that has been received cannot be rejected, as these items are always
approved beforehand.

Advance notification of the item is also given by Development.

Each item has a status related to it. This status is monitored until it signals a
ready state. At this stage, the item is checked to ensure that it has been
developed, unit tested and link tested. Notification of this is provided from
Development.

Process

Once the item has been accepted, any issues surrounding its implementation
are listed and resolved. An impact analysis is carried out. This is done by
assessing the impact on several areas, each of which are contacted and
requested to respond with issues. Responses take the form of man days of
effort involved, timescales, scheduling and plans of action. Training
requirements are also considered as part of the impact analysis. The main
areas of impact are training, Reference Data, testing, development, bench
marking, installation and regression.

The details of the item are examined for dependency on other items, or on
reference data. If there is a requirement for a parallel run, then this is noted.
If there are any dependencies, the priority of the items to be installed is noted
and actioned.

Some items have a critical live date. Any resolutions of the previous issues
that may effect the date are taken into account in deciding and planning the
expected delivery date.

The issues list and item details are received. If the date is a significant
deadline, then it is added to the planning stage. All updates that come in
from monitoring the progress are accepted and added to the plan.

Once all the relevant information is received, then activities are co-ordinated
between the various departments. Any changes that arise to the delivery
date are captured. A text is formulated to notify any urgent changes to the
customer. The text is checked for readability and size and released if it is
suitable.

The plan is created and/or updated.

Process

Progress details, plan details and resolutions are received and used to carry
out a review of the current status of the release. These are all reviewed and
checked for issues. If there are no issues, then the item is approved for
release for live.

If the item has shortfalls, it may be approved for release for live. If the
shortfalls are borderline, the item is escalated.

The plan is amended to incorporate all the changes and these are reported
back to Testing (B &TC and/or OTT). Notifications for approved release for
live are sent to the customer via the escalation process and to the next step,
where the distribution is managed.

Process

Issues are received from the monitoring process that need to be resolved.
The escalation forum considers the issue and decides whether to accept it or
reject it. It then decides the outcome of the issue and either decide to raise
a cross referred PinICL, or defer the release item until a major release. An
approved CP cannot be rejected.

Notification of whether an item has been approved for live is passed on, so
that the client (PON) can be informed. The client is also informed of any
progress made on outstanding issues and any resolutions that have been
made.
