Sparrow and the CCRC.

Laura — see attached a very brief paper on sparrow and the fact that the criminal cases review commission have asked
POL for information on Sparrow. We think this has been prompted by JFSA and POL are collating cases for review.
The Board asked whether we could have gone to the CCRC proactively and Mark D couldn’t answer at the time, hence
the paper attached sent subsequently round the Board.

POL remain confident there is nothing in this, and the Board felt this might even be helpful as it could close one line of

questioning down.
