{think the Thematic Report (previously called the Mediators Briefing Document), will be a good way of briefing MPs.
However, we’re probably 2 or 3 weeks away from having something that is much more than an very early 1“ draft.
One suggestion from Alan is whether we should release an “executive summary” as a 1“ step.

That is a possibility for say sometime next week

Would that be any help?

Many thanks indeed, Ian and Ron, for a really good conversation.

James has just spoken to Alan to get his thoughts on what ought to be raised tomorrow, and his thinking
pretty much concurs with yours.

One thing he did mention was the Mediators Briefing Document. He thinks this would be extremely useful for
you to table formally at this week’s face-to-face working group meeting. He was also of the opinion that MPs
would benefit from seeing it. Whilst I am not asking for this to happen now, is it possible for us to see a copy?
James will raise it as a possible way of updating MPs with Alice and Paula tomorrow morning, as it sounds as if
it could be usefully deployed as such.

Wot think?
Janet
