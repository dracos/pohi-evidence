High level themes

The following themes have been iden

1

The view beyond 2025:

Colleagues are asking for a refreshed
strategic direction and for it to
be communicated effectively.

2

The research suggests that
the strain experienced by
more senior Post Office
colleagues can be linked

to their exposure to politics
and bureaucracy.

Focusing on their experiences of
governance, and how their roles are
crafted may help reduce the strain
that they perceive they are under.

3

Poor communication is
driving a lack of confidence
in Post Office and senior
management from our
colleagues.

This is directly impacting their sense
of pride and belief in Post Office.
This appears to be exacerbated

at present because Post Office's
communications are driven, and
controlled, by the external narrative.

4

Ata time when

communications are
critical, our colleagues have
highlighted that they don't

think we are getting it right.

This is unlikely to be helped by our
communications team being the least
engaged team within Post Office.

d from the overall survey as key priorities for the next 12 months:

Colleagues
character
have a different (less positive)
experience of working at

Post Office.

This is particularly the case for
disabled colleagues, senior women
and senior ethnic minority colleagues
who want to progress.

This is an opportunity area given how intrinsic the role
of confidence is in the overall employee experience (see

who responded positively to each of the four key drivers
of confidence in senior leadership ~ 31% of S&T, 28%
of CFO and 26% of Technology colleagues - and the
opportunity is to deep-dive into these groups and
understand how confidence has formed and how they
can become ambassadors across the wider business.

balanced by many reasons to celebrate ED&l results.

Motivation remains high but colleagues
are less proud than ever before

* Three in four colleagues are motivated to
do the best job they can, but only one in
two feel proud to work at the Post Office,
25pts lower than 2022's annual survey.

‘+ Analysis shows that rather than colleagues
becoming more neutral, the drop in pride is
due to a direct shift to negativity (+17pts, see
page 6). This indicates an emotive response,
likely due to external pressures, rather than
a sustained decline in sentiment over time.

communicating a motivating vision of the
future and communicating openly and
honestly are essential to confidence.

changes including redundancies, site

of colleagues under strain cite
excessive workloads as a barrier
(+24pts vs. non-strained colleagues)

What you should know

‘+ Overall, colleagues under strain are much
more likely to cite workload, understaffing,
conflicting priorities and a difficult
working environment as barriers.

Analysis of barriers across grades paints a
changing picture of strain vs. 2022. While
junior colleagues are significantly less likely
than in 2022 to cite a lack of resources
(-14pts), the inverse is true for SLP (+21pts).

What you should consider

* Further investigation is needed to
identify specific resources or process
changes needed among senior grades
to alleviate the impact of low resource
where restrictions are necessary.

Colleagues across all grades are more
likely to say a difficult working environment
contributes to strain than in 2022. Steps

Culture varies significantly across grades

What you should know

* Those at PO/Admin level see a primarily
friendly, supportive culture defined by
continuous improvement, work-life balance,
respect and learing from mistakes.

+ Among Middle Management and Band
3A, the experience is also friendly
and supportive, but political and
bureaucratic elements feature more
prominently than work-life balance.

‘+ As seniority progresses to Band 4 and
SLP level, bureaucracy and politics,
become defining features of the
culture, in addition to aversion to tisk,
inefficiency and demoralisation.

What you should consider

«These findings add weight to senior
colleagues’ consistently lower scores
and suggest a need for an ingrained
culture shift to address concerns.

‘* Acting on this feedback is of utmost
importance to rebuild leader trust and
prevent negative culture perceptions
from cascading throughout Post Office.
