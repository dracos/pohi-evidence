Simon,

You were asking about any known Horizon issues yesterday. The following is an
issue and may impact on the integrity of Horizon.

I conducted Torch visits to a number of branches today (security visits) and
whilst at Westerham (FAD 056948), the manager (Atul Desai) just happened to show
me a real time anomaly. He had a customer in front of him who wanted to post a
small standard letter (25g) by recorded delivery (signed for). Atul explained
that it should be £1.70 (and I’ve checked and can confirm that £1.70 is
correct). I associate 3 photos in the zip file above which show;

1. The Horizon screen - 11‘ April (during Torch visit) - screen clearly shows
the weight of 25g in the top right hand corner. However, there are no
options displayed concerning a ‘1%* class signed for letter’ at £1.70 (in
the left side service column). Instead the signed for options start at
£3.70 for a ‘24 class signed for small parcel’ to £6.75 for a ‘1** class
signed for medium parcel’. Atul said he has had problems re this for the
past few days and has to reboot the terminal to rectify, which takes a
number of minutes to perform. He has retained letters and asked customers
to pop back for their receipts/proof of posting (as these are generated
from Horizon, once rebooted and once the ‘1** class signed for letter’
option returns).

2. Branch calendar - on 8‘ April Atul has written ‘Horizon terminal shows a
high Value in RD [Recorded Delivery]. Rebooted’.

3. Branch calendar - on 9° April Atul has written a similar entry. He has
also written ‘Called Helpline 10.15am’, and ‘Jessica H17950181’ and ‘Louise
A2636382, Technical Support’. He was advised to reboot, which he did, and
had no problems for the remainder of 9* April or 10 April.

But the problem did return on 11 April (as per 1 above). When I left the branch
the Horizon system was still rebooting, with a few customers in the queue who
couldn’t be served until the reboot had completed.

Up to you if you feel this warrants further action, but it’s for your information
at the very least. I guess the possible integrity issue may be that if this is
occurring at other branches, some less observant SPMRs or less experienced SPMR’s
will simply accept what the screen says and consequently customers could be
overcharged (perhaps an even more serious situation compared to SPMRs raising
their own issues?). That said, although an issue, I don’t know if this is
occurring at only this branch or a wider number of branches. It shouldn’t affect
the SPMRs balance as even if he/she overcharges he/she is obtaining the
corresponding amount of cash to place in the till.
