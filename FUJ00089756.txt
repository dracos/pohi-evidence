luthorisation) if required to make emergency amendments in BRDB Live. Since then Host-Dev have delivered a series of auditable
amendment tools for known SSC data amendment operations in Live, and these are assigned by role to individual SSC user accounts.

3 per the previous PEAK comments, the role 'APPSUP' is extremely
powerful and should only be used under extreme circumstances and under

support users should be given the 'SSC' role, which is effectively read =

luniess the information has not replicated in time. SSC should only =
lsiven the optional role ‘APPSUP' temporarily (by Security Ops
Juuthorisation/emergency MSC) if required to make emergency data
amendments in BRDB Live.

Itt is a security breach if any user write access is not audited on

lsranch Database, hence the emergency MSC for any APPSUP role activity =

flust have session logs attached under the MSc. Host-Dev previously =
rovided scipts, such as the Transaction Correction Tool, are written to =
jrun under the SSC role and also write to the audit logs.

ssc users created on BRDB should only have the SSC role, and the user ~
creation script should be amended by Host-Dev to reflect this. A =
separate script giving/revoking emergency MSC access via APPSUP can be =
ldclivered, logging this to the hostaudit directory. In parallel Host-Dev
should investigate any Host-Dev delivered script to ensure they are all

this change involves updating the SSC User Creation script originally written by Wing (in association with Andy B.) to create ssC
lisers with a default password and a role that would apply to them.

the plan is as such: -

la) All OPS$<SSC> users should have the roles DB MONITOR and APPSUP removed. They also need the SSC role enabled as a DEFAULT. In
effect they should end up as for example:

PSI relevant! RESOURCE
relevant! 5c

fhe SSC role has execute permissions to the Host-Dev delivered packages mentioned in the PEAK and resource, monitor (and hence
connect and select any table) and select any dictionary.

lA sweep up MSC will be required at some point to get these account changes into LIVE ... sensitivity to the needs of $sc when
lpproaching this.

jb) Host-Dev to amend the create _db_user.sh script to:

create user ops\$${USERNAME} default tablespace ${DAREA) quota unlimited on ${DAREA}

It am rejecting the peak / baseline on the basis that it changes new users access to a role that does not exist on all databases
(SSC Role does not exist on DWh, NPS, RDDS or RDMC DBs) and that it is changing / recommending removal of something not requested
in the original peak (removal of the general use of APPSUP / DBMONTTOR roles by the SSC). Tt also recommends these changes be
limplemented by MSC for existing SSC users.

lan email chain has been discussing these issues.
atest is that a meeting with Andy Beardmore (Dev/Design), Steve Parker (SSC), Mark Jarosz (Sec Architect) and Donna Munro (Sec
lops Mgr)is being arrange to discuss further. I suggest this peak is frozen until the outcome of the meeting has been decided.

fhe initial motive for this PEAK was to ensure all SSC users had the SSC role assigned to be able to execute the data correction
toolset on BRDB. Initially the SSC users were manually set up incorrectly against the HNG-X BRDB HLD, being given the same
jpermissions as per Horizon, and had too many privileges via the APPSUP role. Host-Dev have delivered the live scripts to ensure
Inew SSC users have the correct permissions, but a follow-on MSC is required to adjust the privileges of existing users. Graham
Jennings rejected this response as the approach is not consistent across the older Horizon DB's. The fact is that HNG-X did not
include this change to these Horizon environments, so I believe this to be a mute point for this PEAK but more of an interest for
Pct and other Audits. As such I am transferring this PEAK to the new security architect Dave Haywood for further consideration of
tidying up any existing SSC users on BRDB with APPSUP role, only to have RESOURCE & SSC roles.

lAccording to Andy Beardmore's last update, it appears that development have already delivered a fix to apply the correct
jpermissions to users accounts. Given that databases are being replaced as part of Belfast refresh, I assume that when users are
ladded to the new databases, the permissions they are granted by the updated scripts will be correct. Left Andy Beardmore a
foicemail to determine if the above assumption is correct. If it is correct, the call can then be closed on the basis Belfast
Refresh will correct this issue.

ldate:02-dul-2014 11:17:20 User:Dave Haywood
Spoke with Andy Beardmore. Only new users are given the correct permissions. Existing user permissions are copied into the new
builds and hence will not be corrected by Belfast Refresh. Suggest an audit of Live and Test is required to:

h) identify existing AD accounts of Oracle users

2) identify SSC users from (1)

3) run a one-time script (based on the permission scripts already delivered) to set the SSC user permiss

ons correctly

FUJ00089756
FUJ00089756
ihe above activity can be performed under MSC but must be trialled in the Test environment before being changed in hive fo ensure

Ino adverse side-effects are encountered. Given the existing permission change scripts for new users were delivered some years
ago, the probability of the change causing any unforseen issues is thought to be low.
