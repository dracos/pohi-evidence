Executive Summary

« Area Manager led Operational Excellence Visits are designed to provide a consistent approach to branch visits, with the
main aim to reduce discrepancies across key operational measures.

« Launched in July 23, over 5k visits have been conducted across branches identified and prioritised using NORM data.

* Feedback from Area Managers indicates this approach provides clarity and provides clearer structure to their visits, with
supporting content to further enhance the support and knowledge they provide branch teams.

« Early findings have shown positive impact of new approach, with reductions seen across average value of discrepancies
across all focus areas. Further analysis is required to understand longer-term impact.

« Whilst these findings are positive, further work and resource is required to fully leverage
these visits in supporting the wider operational excellence programme, including the

right tools, platform and enhanced data. Sr lL an
