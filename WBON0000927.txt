Pete,

In preparation for this morning’s call, attached is a paper we had previously prepared with James Davidson
in relation to Remote Access. It never got finalised or shared with Second Sight. It may be that this forms the
basis for the answer we provide to Second Sight. But let’s discuss on the call.

This may be useful to have to hand for the call @1 1am. Especially given it seems likely SS query relates to
the BTP process.
