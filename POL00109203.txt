Dear ail,

Please find attached letter which Paula has signed.

Would you like me to post copies to Alan and Anthony, or will you? If me, could you send the addresses.
Thanks,

Avene,

We have had some initial advice in and I have discussed with Belinda. Agree it is definitely not for Paula to meet. How
about putting in the following as a final paragraph instead of the current one:

With regard to your letter of 4 September. I have asked Post Office's Legal Department to look into the case. When
they have done so they will be in touch with your office directly and they will advise on next steps including whether a
meeting with one of the legal team is appropriate at this point.

Avene,

We need external legal advice (given the prosecution element) which we are getting at the moment ~ I will chase it up
today.

We don’t think Paula should meet James or Jim on this case but need to be clear what we will do before we say so and
that is dependant on the legal advice so wanted to give you the option of a holding response.

Regards

David

Hi David,

Many thanks for this. The letter looks good but we’d like to hold of sending it until e can confirm with is happening with
the Jim Hood request, given his letter is from early September.

Do you think we can firm this up in the next day or so we can send a full response early next week? I assume Paula
won't be needed to attend the meeting with Jim/James so probably better to say no now, sooner rather than later and
advise next steps.

Many thanks,

Avene

Gavin, Avene,

Please find attached a draft reply from Paula to James Arbuthnot in response to his letter of 19 September. The draft
has been cleared by Chris, Belinda and Comms (Mel and Jane).

It also acts as a holding reply to the letter requesting a meeting on the Doran case.
Happy to discuss
Regards

David
