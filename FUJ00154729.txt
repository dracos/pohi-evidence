Comments: COMMENT-
Thave had a conversation with Bill Membery.
Our impact in engineering will depend on how system performance is
affected by the new anti-virus program. That is to say, if the Horizon
counters work more slowly, or hang up more ofien because of this then we
will have increased support costs because of the additional calls logged by
PMs. It may be that performance actually improves.But we won't know
the answer until testing is complete, so it is hard to put in any impact at
this stage.
So there is no impact from us in terms of designing and testing the
change, but there may be when it is implemented.

Statement: Security & Risk
Impact Originator: Pete Sewell

Comments: We must abide by the CCB instruction. Assign the next target release
what ever it is, in this phase the CP requires no work effort from the SI
development or test teams. It is design only and the Prove of Concept
stage will be tested internally by the CS AV test group only. It means the
CP will actually have no effort to take into account and can be accepted
into the next release without overhead.
