2. Management Overview
21 Introduction
22 Objective of the Training Programme

ICL Pathway have contracted Peritas Ltd to provide the training programme in support of the BA/POCL
Counter Automation project. The training programme is required by ICL Pathway to meet the following
objectives:

Compatibility - The programme must be managed and delivered in a manner consistent with the
implementation programme undertaken by ICL Pathway Limited and their other subcontractors.

‘Timeliness - No individual is to be trained more than five working d:
of their normal counter position.

's prior to the automation

To the required scope, which is - “To ensure that all staff who work within a post office
are competent in the use of the automated platform, are aware of the impact on
operational procedures caused by the introduction of the platform and that specialist
staff are provided with the appropriate additional information to perform their job role
within an automated post office”

Achieve appropriate competence levels - The delivered programme is required to ensure that
95% of personnel have a minimum competence that they are capable of processing 90% of all
transactions undertaken by their base office correctly.

2.3 Population to be trained

The current contract between BA/POCL and ICL Pathway Ltd provides for 67,000 staff to be trained.
The analysis has identified approximately 71,000 staff to be trained excluding turnover of both staff and
postmasters which will occur during the implementation programme. The number of staff within the
roles identified are:

Postal Officers 7950

Branch Managers/ABM/POA 1300

Subpostmasters 17750
Subpostmasters’ Assistants 40000
Franchise Managers & Staff 2000

Nominees & Staff 1000

Retail Network Managers 350

Auditors 200

Post Office Security 100

POCL Helpline 160

24 Baseline Competencies

There are fundamentally four groupings of competencies within the post office organisation, as defined
by Steve Dance of POCL SW & SW Region.

Numeracy ~ all POCL employees are required to pass a numeracy test, subpostmasters are not.

Counter Operations - it is POCL policy that all post office personnel are expected to operate the
counter transaction services offered at their location. ‘Training however, is variable with POCL
employees having a 6 week training course whereas subpostmasters have a 10 day event, with subsequent
in-outlet support, they are also expected to take responsibility for the training of their counter staff.

Office Administration and Accounts “The daily and weekly balancing functions together with
additional systems administration functions introduced by the platform need to be included within
training for management grades.

Specialist Functions - ‘There are specialist and senior management functions within regions and CB HQ
e.g. audit and fraud investigations which require a more in-depth knowledge of the control and
administration functions of the programme.

25 Leaming Gap

For the majority of personnel a training programme covering counter transactions, daily and weekly
balancing and reporting functions, complemented by the changes to the associated procedures is
sufficient to meet their day to day operational requirements.

For managers, specialists and support staff a longer course covering both counter and management
implications of the programme is required.

Although the above requirements would satisfy the needs in terms of establishing operational
competence, it is essential that there is a 100% attendance at the training programme for users and
support staff. To accomplish this a high degree of co-operation is required within the post office. The
User Awareness programme must include a high level of quality information on the implementation
process and a motivational incentive for all locations and be attended by the majority of managers and
staff.

26 Proposed Training Programme

‘The training programme for the BA/POCL Counter Automation programme on behalf of ICL Pathway
Ltd. should be modular in form, designed to be delivered to meet the operational requirement of the post
office with the minimum disruption to the business and inconvenience to personnel.

‘The programme as a whole is introduced by the User Awareness event which enables offices to plan for
the implementation and generate the necessary awareness of the business benefits which are enabled for

both POCL and their network of Branch and Sub post offices by the introduction of the Counter
Automation programme.

Counter staff within post offices are provided with a 1 day event, typically within 3 days of
implementation.

‘Managers, specialists, support staff and other staff who deputise for managers are offered a 1.5 day event
covering the stock control and accounting functions in addition to the counter functions and procedures.

‘The training courses are closely synchronised with the implementation programme being delivered 10-12
weeks and 5 days prior to the target user “go-live” date.

All staff are invited to the Awareness programme, and it is highly desirable for all. staff and managers of
post offices to attend. However, it is recognised that business and domestic pressures will result in some
staff being unable to attend and therefore contingency procedures are required to ensure that such staff
are not disadvantaged in the subsequent implementation programme.

lll staff who work within a post office must attend the appropriate course and achieve the necessary level
of competence. Alll courses include a competence test relating to their ability to process a number of
transactions to the required level of competence.

Following installation all post offices receive an training review visit to provide support and clarification
of any issues which may have arisen.

3.2 Establishment of Training Delivery Capability

In addition to the ability to train the post office staff to use the automated platform it was considered at
an early stage that for the training programme and individual trainers to have credibility they would
require a familiarity with POCL operations rather than simply knowledge of the automated platform.
The establishment of a trainer’s induction programme which incorporates understanding of both the
automated and non-automated office is critical to the success of the programme.

4, Findings
41 Benetits Agency

4.4.1 BA Training Programme
The Benefits Agency training development unit is developing a series of training modules which define
the basic processes for BA staff when interacting with the CAPS system. These processes are generic and
relate to any type of benefit. The modules are:
© Introduction to CAPS
New and repeat claims action, on PDCS
The effect of CAPS on payments
Enquiries/Information
Changing details on PDCS

Dealing with changes that affect card payment
Conversion and Transition

Additional checks, outputs and instructions

Consolidation - end to end business processing of business events

The BA training programme does not include any details of changes within post office operations relating
to the payment of benefits or the information which benefits offices may obtain from post offices when
making payments.

4.2 Post Offices

4.2.1 Types of Post Office
‘There are a number of types of post office including:
e Branch Offices
* Modified Subpostoffices, which supersede the geographic scope previously covered by a
Branch Office
© Franchise Offices
© Cash account subpostoffice
© Non cash account subpostoffice
‘These post offices vary in size, and other than Branch Offices, ownership. ‘The principal groups of
employer are:
© Post Office Counters (Branch only)
© Multiple Retailers e.g, Martins Retail
© Independent Retailers

4.2.2 Basic Competencies
4.2.2.1 Numeracy

All POCL employees are required to pass a numeracy test, subpostmasters are not.

4.2.2.2. Counter Operations

It is POCL policy that all post office personnel are expected to operate the counter transaction services
offered at their location. Training however, is variable with POCL employees having a 6 week modular
training course whereas subpostmasters have a 10 day event, with subsequent in- outlet support, and are
also expected to take responsibility for the training of their counter staff.

4.2.2.3 Office Administration and Accounts

All subpostmasters, counter managers and some assistants, plus other management functions. The daily
and weekly balancing functions together with additional systems administration functions introduced by
the platform need to be included within training for management grades,

4.2.2.4. Specialist Functions

‘There are specialist and senior management functions within regions and CBHQ (e.g; audit and fraud
investigations) which require a more in-depth knowledge of the control and administration functions of
the system.

42.3 Job Roles

‘There are 25 job titles (with associated grades) within the post office organisation, These titles may be
simplified into the following roles:-

Postal Officers (POCL)
‘The function of this job role is to serve POCL customers with a varied range of transactions. ‘They are

accountable to POCL and all clients for report production, daily and weekly, and are fully accountable for
all transactions, plus cash and stock. Approximately 50% of postal officers are part-time.

Branch Managers, Assistant Branch Managers and Postal Officer with Allowance

Responsible for the efficient operation of their post office throughout the year. ‘They provide operational
expertise in resolving areas of uncertainty in client/customer service. ‘They are fully responsible for their
staff and the production of an office cash account.

Subposunasters (Agent of POCL)

They are business people with a private business acting as POCL agents for the community. Their
expertise is basically the same as a postal officer, with the additional responsibility for the production of
the office account.

Subpostmasters’ assistants (employee of a Subpostmaster)

Are employed by sub postmaster and theit general duties are basically the same as a postal officer and are
not always independent stock or cash holders but can carry out weekly balances for their sub postmaster.

Franchise Managers (Employee of Franchise owner or Multiple Retailer)

Mainly dedicated staff employed to operate post office concessions within larg
perform the same job role as branch manager/postal officer. Staff employed within these outlets are
normally part-time and the concession opening hours normally are extended to be the same as the retail
outlet.

Multiple (Nominees)
Multiple companies, e.g. Forbuoys, operate chains of retail outlet in which a post office service is run.
‘The staff running the post office are normally employees of the particular multiple. ‘They perform the

same role as subpostmasters and subpostmasters’ assistants.

Retail Network Managers (POCL)

POCL employed managers who are responsible for the efficient operation of a number of post offices
providing advice on various topics, responsible for appointing subpostmasters and branch managers.

Relief Subpostmasters (Freelance)

Normally contracted in by the subpostmaster for holiday relief, they have the same responsibilities for the
smooth running of the business and normally have the same skills levels as subpostmasters.

Regional / National Auditors (POCL)
Responsible for all financial/accounting and operational procedures within the post office.
POCL Security & Investigation Service (POCL)

Responsible for the prevention/investigation of both external and internal crime. ‘They have a working
knowledge of POCL counter operations and accounting procedures.

425 Availability for Training

The critical factors are:-

50% of POCL counter staff and 80% of subpostoffice assistants work part-time and a significant
percentage are female with domestic responsibilities.

A large number of offices with 1 or 2 counter positions have a small establishment, typically operated by
a husband and wife. The implication is that day time training would involve either closing the business or
incurring the expenditure of a relief postmaster. ‘The actual option exercised would be governed by the
POCL reimbursement policy.

4.2.6 The Operational Environment

Counter positions are generally cramped and subject to interruption to service customer requirements,
even when officially closed. ‘They are therefore unsuitable for the efficient delivery of initial training
relating to agreed major operational change.

4.3 Facilities of the Automated Platform

The facilities currently defined by ICL Pathway as included within Release 1 of the automated platform
are:-

Order Book Control Service (OBCS).
Benefit Encashment (BES)
Electronic Point of Sale (EPoS)
Automated Payments System (APS)

‘These functions transform the processing of counter transactions and will significantly impact the existing
balancing procedures and submission of data to Chesterfield.

4.4 Training Delivery Options
441 In-Outlet Training

‘The operational environment precludes the efficient delivery of in-outlet training, ‘The AnPost
experience, where such an approach was applied, resulted in a much slower progression towards live
working than would be acceptable for this programme (je. 1 month from installation) complemented by a
much more labour intensive requirement for training staff.

ICL Pathway Training Programme Ref: SU/TRN/0001

ini i Version: 1.0
Training Needs Analysis Date: 19/03/97

4.4.2. Classroom Training

A dedicated classroom event, with user interaction and a delivery within the context of the business
operation has been identified by research to be the most efficient process for initial learning. However,
to be truly efficient the venues must be readily accessible i.e. 15-30 minutes travel, and timings of events
must satisfy both business and domestic requirements.

44,3. Programmed Learning

Programmed learning techniques using an operational workbook have been found to be efficient
provided the following conditions can be provided:

(a.) Readily accessible support for problem areas.
(a.) Awareness by the trainee that their individual progress is being monitored.
(a.) Time to undertake the consolidation exercises within the programme by the required deadline.

For the majority of post offices the conditions could only be provided for limited learning activities e.g.
update programmes.

444 Computer Based Training (CBT)

CBT would provide the ideal medium for training consolidation and subsequent provision of back-up
support. However, the secure nature of the Riposte application, the heart of the automated platform
precludes the coexistence of other software packages. As a consequence this approach has been
discounted as not technically viable, rather a training mode where procedures may be undertaken from
within, rather than alongside, the application could be used to replicate and record progress. Such a
facility could be used to provide ongoing support, remedial and refresher training as the product and
personnel develop.

45° Maintaining Competencies

Having established the core operational competencies it is essential to maintain expertise as staff within
the business change and also new postmasters are appointed.

The general levels of staff turnover are:-

POCL staff (ow) < 5%
Subpostmasters (Medium) 10%
Subpostmasters’ assistants (High) 15-20%

The subpostmasters’ assistants turnover rate is derived from studies undertaken by Peritas Ltd on behalf
of Camelot Group PLC of post office National Lottery outlets.

POCL themselves do not monitor the competence of subpostmaster’s assistants and there are legal
constraints which imply that POCL are not permitted to provide training and development for this group
which represents approximately 60% of the population.

5, Recommendations
5.1 Implementation Training
5.1.1 Post Offices

‘The training programme for the BA/POCL Counter Automation programme on behalf of ICL Pathway
Ltd. should be modular in form, designed to be delivered to meet the operational requirement of the post
office with the minimum disruption to the business and inconvenience to the personnel.

The programme as a whole is introduced by the User Awareness event which enables offices to plan for
the implementation and generate the necessary awareness of the business benefits which are enabled for
both POCL and their agencies by the introduction of the programme.

‘Training for counter staff must be delivered within a classroom environment, the duration for this
training being 1 day to ensure that there is sufficient learning and practical time to reach the target level
of competence and for proper assessment. However, some will require the 1.5 day course in order to
enable them to undertake additional duties or provide management cover.

‘Management and support personnel, including relief staff, require an extended course of 1.5 days
include the management and administration functions within the post office. In order to provide
flexibility of timing this would be offered within 5 working days of the planned implementation.

‘The training courses are closely synchronised with the implementation programme being delivered 12
weeks and 5 days prior to the target user “go-live” date. Each event will be made available within 30
minutes travelling time for the majority of outlet staff and at a time to cause minimum operational and
personal inconvenience.

Al staff should attend the awareness programme and, in addition, all staff who work within a post office
must attend the course appropriate to their role and achieve the necessary level of competence. To
ensure this, the site survey must encompass verification of the management duties undertaken, in
particular identifying staff who deputises in managerial positions. A training review visit is provided
which may be apportioned according to the individual needs of the staff within an office, i.e. a small
office with 3 staff would have a half day of general support. The needs will also vary according to the
type of transition undertaken by an office e.g, for an automated office the visit will be synchronised to
support the initial live operation.

The training programme incorporates testing and review procedures which correspond to Kirkpatrick
levels 1 and 2 in accordance with service level agreements specified in Requirement 915 of the contract
between PDA (for BA/POCL) and ICL Pathway Ltd.

5.1.2. Benefits Agency

‘The current BA development programme is deficient in that there is a lack of awareness of those
developments within post offices which could be used to improve the level of service provided by BA
offices to the public. It is recommended that all BA staff undertaking a training delivery role should
attend the core post office staff training programme or that an equivalent briefing programme be
established,

In order to address these deficiencies within the current programme the following supplementary training
services are recommended:

5.1.2.1 Training Consultancy

‘Training consultancy, available from ICL Pathway (Peritas) on a call off basis. This service will provide
for a two-way review and assurance of the BA training products.

5.1.2.2 Facilitators Training Course

A half day training course for up to 15 “CAPS training handover” facilitators. The detailed content to
include:

The impact on post offices

Horizon rollout strategy

Procedural changes within POCL

Operation of CMS and PAS

5.1.2.3 Handover workshops

‘The new concept of payment by card needs to be conveyed to all staff, particularly Field Training
Officers. This would occur prior to the delivery by BA of their handover workshops.

5.2 Staff Changes
5.2.1 Staff Turnover
5.2.1.1 POCL Offices

It is considered that the responsibility for training new staff within POCL’s own offices is best
undertaken by incorporating training for the automated platform within the counter skills tr
currently being reviewed by the National Training function within Post Office Counters Ltd.
staff should be required to attend the POCL Train the Trainer event provided by Peritas on behalf of
ICL Pathway Ltd. Having attended the event they will be included in the distribution list for trainer
update notifications and also be authorised to order training materials. In order to ensure maintenance of
training standards the trainer accreditation will include a formal update /refresher event provided either
annually or to support new product releases.

5212 Franchise Offices and Multiples

Although many franchise/multiple retailers have their own training organisations, their lack of knowledge
of post office procedures causes such retailers to be considered as independent sub postmasters from the
perspective of staff turnover training.

5.2.1.3. Independent sub post offices (i.e. Sub post offices not owned by a multiple retailer)

During the implementation programme it is recommended that new sub postmasters and their assistants
receive the standard training programmes for manual offices with a supplementary Horizon counter
training event appropriate to their role.

5.2.2. Staff Promotions

During the roll out period counter operations staff may be promoted to management positions or
otherwise asked to perform a management function not covered by the basic counter operations course.

ICL Pathway will offer a 1 day management upgrade course. This event would review basic counter
operations, in order to verify baseline entry competence, and cover those topics covered in the manager’s
