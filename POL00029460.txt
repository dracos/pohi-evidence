MAJOR INCIDENT REPORT

INCIDENT DETAILS

Post Office Card Account transactions were unable to complete and a
number (approximately 1%) of AP Transactions were affected following the

Incident St
dsctel Sle ad AP Ref Data Monthly update being enabled on Wednesday 1°‘ February.

Between 08:00 and 11:15 on Wednesday 1 February all Post Office Card
Account transactions were unable to complete and a number of AP

Service Impacted u "
Transactions were matched to an incorrect client

Post Office Card Account transactions and some AP Transactions were
affected from 08:00 on Wednesday " February. Due to a problem with a
scheduled Reference Data update of monthly AP Ref Data for token IDs.

This resulted in the two token IDs being incorrectly mapped, 1980 and
1981 (Highland Council).

Pxecutive surmmary, To resolve the issue Fujitsu identified the fault, produced correcting data in
conjunction with the Post Office Reference Data team, and tested and
delivered an update to the AP Ref Data.

Corrected AP Ref Data was available to Branches from 11:00. Post Office
Card Account transactions and the affected AP transactions resumed from
approximately 11:15. By 12:30 99% of branches had downloaded the
corrected Ref Data.

Post Office Ltd provided Reference Data for the monthly AP Ref Data
update which included the two Token IDs 1980 and 1981. The Fujitsu
Reference Data Team completed a technical validation against the file
provided, which was subsequently verified by Post Office Ltd.

This was a second iteration of the data as a problem had been identified
with the initial data set that had been supplied during validation of the
token data. The CTO update was in effect a primary package with an
incremental update.

Following validation of the data by both Reference Data teams the update
was loaded on 26" January to the live environment with an enablement
date of the 1*' February.

The definition of a magnetic card or barcode within Reference Data
5S includes a number of elements. These elements are essential in defining
Aualyais ol crotlent the token mask which is used to match the set of Reference Data tokens
(cards and barcodes) against each swiped card or barcodeso as to
determine which client the token applies to, and also what counter
functionality is to be invoked.

In the case of these tokens defined for 1°' February, an element was
missing from one version of the Reference Data for an AP client. As a
consequence, any scanned magnetic card or barcode that matched with
the rogue token matched to Highland Council as the client instead of being
matched to the correct client for that token. This led to an AP transaction
being launched for the client associated with the rogue token. Both AP and
ETOP clients were affected as in both cases their transactions are
launched via a card swipe or barcode read.

Evidence to date suggests that Post Office Card Account cards were the
only banking cards affected

Activity to date has been focussed on resolving the issue and minimising
the impact to Post Office Ltd and their clients.

Root Cause Analysis

However the focus of the parallel investigation is the system handling of
the incremental package. In addition as the update was validated any
variance of the verification rigs to the live environment.
Fujitsu identified the mismatch on Ref Data and produced a corrected set
of Ref Data to load into the BRDB and resolve the issue.

Corrective Actions As authorised by Post Office Ltd, Fujitsu quarantined the 6831
transactions which were affected to contain the situation and limit the
impact to POLSAP and Credence.
