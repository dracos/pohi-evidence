August 2013.DOCX

Dear All

Please find attached two separate terms of reference for Brian Altman QC as amended in response to his observations
document which I also attach for ease of reference.

Please note that POL needs to decide on the issue of whether he is to be asked to report to the Board on the efficacy or
safety of past prosecutions — see footnote 4 on page 3 of Brian's observations.
Simon's and my view is that he shouldn't report on the safety of past convictions for two reasons:

- this is likely to involve a more significant analysis of lots of cases, thereby delaying his report
- and potentially blurs the boundary between BA and CK's respective roles.

The terms of reference need to be finalised in time for Brian's return from holiday.
I am now away on holiday until Tuesday 27 August. Both Simon and Andy will be in during this period.
Kind regards

Gavin Matthews
