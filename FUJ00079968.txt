1.0 Introduction

11 Process Owner

The owners of this process are the Fujitsu HSD Operations Manager and the POA Service
Delivery Team Manager responsible for the Fujitsu contract.

12 Process Objective

The objective of this document is to define the process for Incident Management in the POA
environment. For the purpose of this document an Incident is defined as:

“Any event which is not part of the standard operation of a service and which causes, or may
cause, an interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that service.”

This process applies to all Incidents received by the POA HSD, where they are related to the
Fujitsu outsourcing contract. N.B calls presented to POA HSD that should be placed with the
NBSC are transferred/ referred from POA HSD to NBSC.

The scope of the process is from the receipt of an incident by the HSD, through to the
successful workaround or resolution of the incident.

For clarity it should be noted that the HSD/IMT are responsible for managing/owning
Incidents and the POA Problem Initiator is responsible for managing/owning Problems, as
defined by ITIL.

13 Process Rationale

The primary goal of the Incident Management process is to restore normal service operation
as quickly as possible, thereby minimising adverse impact to the business. In turn this ensures
the highest level of service quality and availability. Normal service operation is defined here
as service operation within Service Level Targets (SLT).

This process takes account of the requirements of improved service to be delivered to POL,
through the introduction of the HSD. The implementation of the IMT is documented and is
aimed at delivering improved understanding and communication between POL and POA
leading to an increase in the perceived service level within POL.

Process Date: 02-Aug-2005
2.0 Inputs

The inputs to this process are:

e All Incidents reported by Contact with the HSD. Contact is defined as voice or Tivoli
Alert as the methods of communication with the HSD and fall into the following
categories:

© Business process error

o Hardware or software error

o Request for information e.g. progress of a previously reported Incident
o Network Error

e Severity and SLT information.

e Evidence of an Error.

e System Alerts received automatically from OMDB. Due to the urgent nature of these
alerts they will be dealt with directly by SSC, with an update of workaround or resolution
supplied to HSD. It should be noted that these alerts enter the process at step 3, and are
not subject to steps 1 & 2 of this process.

3.0 Risks and Dependencies

3.1 Risks
The following define the risks to the successful delivery of the process:

e Break in the communications chain to third parties. Mitigation is to invoke escalation
procedures.

e Non-availability of the Powerhelp or HSD ONE systems. Mitigation is given in the HSD
Business Continuity Plan.

e Lack of information given to the HSD regarding changes, POL Business updates, request

for changes, status of Problems etc. Processes must be followed to lessen this risk, such

as the Change Management and Problem Management Processes.

Unavailability of sufficient support unit staff

Unavailability of sufficient tools for Incident diagnosis

Non-availability of KEL or call management systems

The provision of inadequate staff training within the HSD, SDU’s or 3 party suppliers

Unavailability of systems for evidence gathering.

3.2. Dependencies
This process is dependent on:

e Effective Incident handling by the HSD
e The known error information being available and kept up to date with all errors as the
root cause becomes known to Problem Management

An Incident is received through contact (see definition in Section 2.0 above) with the
HSD from:

Users

Fujitsu SDUs

POA IT Service Management

Third Parties

Fujitsu Service Delivery Management

The caller may be enquiring about an existing Incident. Details are provided and if
the response is satisfactory, contact is ended, moving the incident to step 5. If the
caller is not satisfied with the response, the relevant Escalation Procedure is invoked.
In cases of Incidents that are either taking a long time to resolve or involve multiple
SDU’s, the HSD alerts Problem Initiator to provide focused management of the
Incident.

For a new Incident, Contact details are recorded if not system generated. Details
taken are dependent upon the error reported. Typically they may include:

The user’s name and unique ID number

Location and contact details

Alternative contact details (where appropriate)

Hardware details as appropriate

Software error details, including application use at point of failure where known
Business and User Impact

Description of Incident

Location access times

Caller assessment of the priority of the incident.

Classification of Call determined as one of the following:

Error Incident — invoke Incident Management Process Step 2

Quality — record details of complaint or compliment and invoke the relevant
Escalation Procedure.

Advice & Guidance — refer to NBSC.

Out of scope — if the call is not within scope for the services provided by Fujitsu
advise the caller of the correct number or refer to POL NBSC and close incident.

The caller is advised of call reference number and the incident follows the process as

appropriate for the nature of the call.

Steps

2.1 The HSD agent collects additional information in order to determine the nature,
impact and urgency of the Incident.

2.2 Call Severity is assigned based on the impact and urgency as per the following
criteria:

A Critical e BUSINESS STOPPED, a Post Office down, unable to
process any business, or central system failure which will
result in a number of Post Offices being unable to process

work.

B Major ¢ BUSINESS RESTRICTED, a Post Office restricted in its
ability to transact business, e.g. one counter down.

Cc Medium e NON-CRITICAL, a Post Office working normally but with a

known disability, e.g. an interim solution (workaround) has
been provided.

D Low e INTERNAL, an internal HSH/HIT/SMC problem, e.g. a help
desk PC or a phone set inoperable.

2.3 If the incident is considered a Major Incident as defined in CS/PRD/122 Customer
Service Major Incident Escalation Process, Escalation Procedures are invoked.

e The HSD/SMC agent should also be aware that a Serious Complaint may follow the
Dissatisfied PM process in the majority of cases whereby the agent alerts IMT of
possible escalation to MP/Press/or threatening PO closure. IMT will then notify POL
Customer Relations team with details. In this context a Serious Complaint is defined
as one threatening contact with Media, Politicians or threatening violence of any
form.

Process Date: 02-Aug-2005

2.4 The HSD agent then attempts to resolve the Incident using the resources available.
This starts by interrogating HSD ONE to find all information related to the Incident
symptoms. If the Incident is routine, i.e. there is a predetermined route for
resolution, then the Incident is resolved on the call or referred to the relevant SDU
using the HSD Support Matrix in HSD ONE.

2.5 If the Incident is not routine, the HSD agent checks for Known Errors listed in HSD
ONE and the SSC KEL against records relating to the Incident symptoms. If a match
is found, the agent informs the caller of the workaround or resolution available.

2.6 If there is no match in HSD ONE or the SSC KEL, the Powerhelp stack is checked
for current incidents outstanding. If a match is made, the caller is then advised of the
status of the incident and the problem record is updated to reflect the current
occurrence.

2.7 Ifno match is made against the Powerhelp stack, the HSD continues with first line
resolution of the Incident assisted by the Product Support Engineers (PSE’s). IMT
are appraised of the position.

2.8 If the PSE’s cannot resolve the Incident, it is referred to the relevant SDU using the
HSD Support Matrix in HSD ONE. IMT are appraised of the position.

Steps

3.1 2° line support stage. The referred SDU investigates and diagnoses the

Incident, based on information already taken by the HSD, together with any
new information. The SDU also coordinates where sub-contract third parties
are involved. If the Incident has no associated KEL, or it is complex and
involves multiple SDU’s, or if it has been unresolved for an extended period,
the IMT will alert the POA Problem Initiator to the existence of a pattern
likely to produce a Problem. The POA Problem Initiator is responsible for
deciding if a Problem should be raised, in collaboration/discussion with the
POA SDM aligned to this area of the business as appropriate.
N.B. In order to understand which Problem to relate further occurrences to,
IMT will get information on a Problem from the KEL, which has been updated
with the problem reference by the POA Problem Initiator. The POA Problem
Initiator will also need to input information regarding specific patterns to
watch for, as these will be different for each Incident.

Out of hours, SMC will discuss incidents with the Duty Manager, who in turn
will discuss incidents with the line of business SDM. It is the responsibility of
the SDM to alert the POA Problem Initiator to incidents occurring out of hours
that may need to be added to the Problem Management stack. This will be
contained in the following mornings daily handover log.

4.1 A workaround or resolution is produced by the SDU.

4.2 The SDU then either applies the workaround or resolution or passes it to the
HSD to implement. The Master Incident Record (if one exists) remains open
at this point.

4.3. The SDU checks the workaround or resolution has been successful. HSD are
responsible for updating details recorded in HSD ONE, from details supplied
via the KEL created by SSC. HSD ONE should be identical to SSC KEL in
relation to Application Software, but may also contain additional information.

4.4 Where this Incident has a number of Calls referenced to it, or where there is a
probability that proactive action is required to prevent further occurrences of
this Incident the IMT will alert the POA Problem Initiator to the existence of a
pattern likely to produce a Problem.

4.5 The Incident is then passed to the HSD to manage the closure.

5.2.5 Step 6: Ownership, Monitoring, Tracking and Communication

Responsible: HSD, SSC

Throughout the Incident, the HSD retains ownership for monitoring and keeping the call
taiser informed of progress, unless the incident is specifically software related, in which case
SSC hold the responsibility for confirming details of closure.

The HSD manages the complete end-to-end Incident process.
Activities include:

Regularly monitoring the status and progress towards resolution of all open Incidents
Note Incidents that move between different specialist support groups, indicative of
uncertainty and possibly a dispute between support staff

Give priority for Incident monitoring to high-impact Incidents

Keep affected users informed of progress without waiting for them to call, thus
creating a pro-active profile

Monitors SLT and escalates accordingly. If an Incident has no associated KEL or, it
is complex and involves multiple SDU’s, or if it has been unresolved for an extended
period, IMT will alert the POA Problem Initiator to the existence of a pattern likely to
produce a Problem

Updating HSD ONE from information supplied from SSC KEL. This may be applied
as a direct copy or amended for use by the agents, dependant upon the technical
complexity of the update.
