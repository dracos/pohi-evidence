The Second Sight work has now been subsumed into the mediation scheme we have established. This scheme was
specifically designed to address the concerns raised in the Second Sight report and is open to all subpostmasters and has
been advertised. Any subpostmaster is entitled to make an application to the scheme, regardless of whether or not
their case was previously under investigation by Second Sight. The scheme is being overseen by a working group with an
independent chair. Second Sight is a member of the Working Party and will act as expert advisors to the

group. Specifically each application to the scheme will be thoroughly investigated and Second Sight will do a report and
recommendation to the working group on each case.

Best wishes

Belinda

Martin, Belinda,

Many thanks for your work on these today. Very happy to accept your changes. However as a warning we
maybe pushed relatively hard on the answer to the final question (about the expected timings of the final
report). Can you please provide me some background on this point - which we obviously will treat
confidentially.

Kind regards
Peter

The draft PQ responses have been reviewed here and I attach tracked suggested amends to 1676 and 1679
(please can you check that these read ok once changes have been accepted as I have left the tracking so you can

see the amends}. There are no suggested changes to 1677.

Many thanks

Hi Belinda

Many thanks for your helpful reply.

I've attached my draft answers which I hope use the correct terminology. I would welcome your and
Mike's comments on these. Can you please include the date of the first meeting of the Working Group
in the first answer?

Many thanks and best wishes

Thanks Martin

in answer to the specific questions raised by Peter:

Sir Anthony Hopper has been appointed as the independent chair of the Working Group overseeing the
Initial Mediation Scheme for Subpostmasters. Press release will issue today.

The Working Group has met.

Peter, please note the terminology — I would be keen to ensure that even though the questions have
been phrased using the incorrect terminology, we rectify that in our responses. Specifically, we have an
independent chair of a Working group which is overseeing an Initial Mediation Scheme.

I would also like Mike Granville to confirm he’s content before we finalise any response on this.

Best wishes
Belinda

Subject: Horizon PQs

Dear all,

We have received four Named Day PQs from lan Murray relating to Horizon. There are quite
tight deadlines applied to Named Day PQs, and there are a couple of questions I would be
grateful if you could look at quickly and get back to me by the end of today.

- Has Sir Anthony Hooper been formally appointed, can we reference this in an answer to a PQ?
- Has the independent mediation group held its first meeting yet, or do you have a date for
when it will?

For reference, Murray's questions are:

1. who will chair the review that will determine how best to adjudicate future disputed cases
with regards to the Horizon system; and whether the review body has yet met

2. what recent discussions he has had with Post Office Limited regarding the Horizon system
3. when (a) he, (b) Ministers in his Department and (c) officials in his Department met the
Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance

4. when he expects Second Sight to produce its final report on the Post Office Limited Horizon
system

Many thanks
Peter
