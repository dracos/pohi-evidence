I don’t think we can operate this way. We’ve been asking repeatedly for an update from you as had been agreed
would be provided after each board meeting. In the absence of something from you it looks like we will have to draft
something again which is not ideal.

The protocol is also outstanding still.

Please could you and Jane come over next week to discuss.

I'll ask Marcus to find a time that works for everyone.

I had understood that the report I sent on 14 May 2018 had been shared with Alex following the Board
and Subcommittee meetings held in May, the outcome of which is that a further meeting on the
Postmaster Litigation will be held between Alex, Tom and our senior management later in the summer,
once the practical implications of counsels’ opinion (which is essentially lengthy and complex legal
analysis) had been assessed by Post Office.

In light of that development, I had no longer anticipated the need to provide a formal briefing on the
merits opinion. We have however provided you with five separate updates on developments with the
Postmaster Complaints in the intervening period.

In addition to the CCMC held on Tuesday, we are also this week finalising Defences to the Individual
Particulars of Claim filed by five of the Lead Claimants in the Common Issues trial, each of which is c.50
pages long. These must be filed with the Court tomorrow. I trust you will appreciate that hitting this
critical court deadline needs to take priority over any additional reporting.

Kind regards, Rodric

Hi Rodric
I hope all is well.

lam sure you have been busy with the CMC yesterday, but was hoping you might be able to give me an
update on the below. The urgency in getting an update on the case to Alex is in increasing significantly
and we would appreciate if you could provide the update, in particular on the merits opinion, so that we
are able to do so as soon as possible.

Many thanks
Helen

Please find attached the protocol with minor amendments. We hope this can now be considered agreed.

I was also wondering whether you might be able to give me an expected timescale for receipt of the
written update following last week’s board meeting.

Many thanks
