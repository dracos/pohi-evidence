                                                                   MI  IYZ!




I, Hugh Meyrick Flemington, will say as follows:


 II,{s].III$ltsII'


   1.     This witness statement is made to assist the          Office Horizon IT Inquiry
                                                         Post




          (the "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 request dated 30
          January 2024 (the "Request").


   2,     At the outset, I want to express my heartfelt sympathy for sub-postmasters
          and sub-postmistresses ("SPMs") and the families affected by the
          important issues being considered by the Inquiry.


   3.     I have attempted to the best of my ability to recall events and provide
          comprehensive assistance to the Inquiry. It is important to say that the
          majority of events which are described in this witness statement occurred
          approximately 10 to 15 years ago. I left my employment with the Post
          Office Limited ("POL") on 20 March 2014, and do not have access to
          POL's records of emails and documents which existed at the relevant time
          to assist my recollection. My recollection has been helped to an extent by
                                                                                      WITNO8620100
                                                                                 WITNO8620100




      carefully considering the documents provided to me by the Inquiry, but it
      is still difficult to recall accurately the detail and          surrounding
      circumstances of all events.


4.    1 have referred to the roles of individuals throughout this statement to
      assist the Inquiry, although this is to the best of my recollection, and I do
      not have a record of the various roles.


5.    1 have been assisted by BCL Solicitors LLP in the preparation of my
      witness statement.




6.    1 trained as a solicitor in Exeter and qualified as a company and commercial
      lawyer in 1996. With one-year's post qualification experience, I accepted
      a role in a City law firm working primarily on the IT & IP aspects of mergers
      and acquisitions, and remained at this firm for 4 years (1997 — 2001).


7,    I then joined another City law firm in the IT & IP department and worked
      there from 2001 to 2004, before taking up an in-house role at a private
      healthcare specialist between 2004 and 2009, working on a variety of
      commercial contracts.




9.    Prior to joining RMG, I had very limited civil litigation experience (I had
      undertaken a six-month seat while completing my training contract more
      than a decade previously) and no criminal law experience.




10.   By way of an overview of my roles over time, I initially worked in RMG's
      Group Tech & IP team (based at RMG's Blackfriars offices). I increasingly

                                                                               WITNO8620100




      did work for the separate POL legal team ("POL Legal") (based at POL's
      Old Street offices), such that by Easter 2010 1 was working exclusively in
      POL Legal. I became Head of Legal in POL Legal in August 2011. After
      the separation of RMG and POL on 1 April 2012 1 remained Head of Legal
      at POL Legal, a position I held until I left POL on 20 March 2014. I provide
      further detail regarding these roles below.


11.   I initially worked in RMG's Group Tech & IP team, under a lawyer seconded
      from a City law firm to RMG, who reported to Doug Evans, General
      Counsel of RMG. In this role, I worked on a variety of commercial contracts
      and IP matters, alongside external law firms. RMG ran an external model,
      whereby each matter would have an internal and external lawyer working
      on it.


12.   Until September 2010, I worked 5 days a week and thereafter I moved to
      4 days a week (always Monday — Thursday).


13.   Prior to the separation of RMG and POL, the RMG legal team consisted of
      a number of different teams, including POL Legal, the Competition Law
      Team, the Group Tech & IP Team, the HR and Employment Team, the
      Civil Litigation Team and the Criminal Law Team. The RMG legal team
      was based in Blackfriars, save that the Criminal Law Team was based in
      an office in Victoria, and POL Legal was based in Old Street. I understood
      that each of the RMG sub-teams (each of which had their own Head of
      Legal) reported up to RMG's General Counsel, Doug Evans, and later
      when he left in December 2010, a secondee General Counsel from a City
      law firm.


14.   Prior to separation, POL Legal was entirely non-contentious and POL's
      litigation needs were met by the RMG Civil Litigation Team and the RMG
      Criminal Law Team. In 2010 or 2011, I became aware that prosecutions
      were undertaken by RMG's Criminal Law Team, but I had no specific


                                   Page 3 of 56
                                                                                  WITNO8620100
                                                                                WITNO8620100




      a Head of Legal (Kiron Farooki), together with: (i) a networks lawyer,
      responsible for dealing with SPM contracts; (ii) a property lawyer; and (iii)
      a commercial lawyer who covered areas such as telecoms and IT.


16.   Susan Crichton joined POL Legal as Legal & Compliance Director in
      around January 2010. Whilst Kiron Farooki was Head of Legal at POL at
      that time, Susan Crichton came in above her. Kiron Farooki, along with all
      other lawyers in the team, worked to Susan Crichton. I recall that Susan
      Crichton had a reporting line to the RMG General Counsel pre-separation,
      and then to Paula Vennells (CEO of POL from 2012 onwards) post-
      separation.


17.   During the early part of 2010, 1 became increasingly dedicated to POL
      Legal work at the invitation of Susan Crichton, which resulted in me
      gradually transitioning over to work exclusively for the POL Legal team
      around Easter 2010. Notwithstanding that I was working in the POL Legal
      team, my contract of employment remained with RMG until separation.


18.   On going to work at POL Legal from Easter 2010, Susan Crichton steadily
      involved me in a broad range of matters, which included a significant
      degree of work in the run-up to separation, together with supporting bids
      for government work, procurement services (ranging from issues such as
      stationery to cash vans), ROMEC (property maintenance), payment card
      industry accreditation, and other matters such as mutualisation and state
      aid.


19.   Kiran Farooki left as Head of Legal at POL in Spring 2011. Susan Crichton
      continued in her role as Legal and Compliance Director and, in August
      2011, I was offered and became Head of Legal at POL. When I became
      Head of Legal, the other lawyers in POL Legal reported to me. All of the
      team were non-contentious lawyers at this time. This was the first time I
                                                                                         WITNO8620100
                                                                                    WITN08620100




        had undertaken such a role, and I was very much dependent on Susan
        Crichton's guidance on the scope, nature and detail of the role.


20.     My day-to-day work as Head of Legal included:


         I.   working with the lawyers to find new ways of collaborating with the rest
              of the business;
                •~•    s         a-   s       !'     g          a     a     •_

              particular being a sounding-board or a point of escalation on non-
              contentious matters;
       iii.   managing individuals i.e. performance reviews and regular one to one
              meetings;
       iv.    managing `business-as-usual' spend of a budget set by a separate
              finance team (but not project budgets);
        v.    dealing with law firm panel matters;
       vi.    assisting on, as and when necessary, public procurement and supply
              chain issues together with matters such as POL bidding for
              government     work,    state aid,   network   transformation,     Crown
              transformation or mutualisation planning, all of which were large scale
              and/or time consuming;
      vii.    dealing with requests from colleagues in other parts of the business;
      viii.   recruiting and staffing within HR-set headcount limits; and
       ix.    dealing with miscellaneous matters such as the summer student
              placement scheme.


21.      It is important for context to emphasise that as Head of Legal,
         approximately 95% of the work that I did was not related to the Horizon
         issues described below. My involvement with Horizon was initially sporadic
         and peripheral (for example, relating to a specific issue such as resourcing
         for the Civil Litigation Team regarding John Longman in September 2011
         (see paragraph 63 below)), until the very end of June 2013 when, before
         going on sabbatical from 12 July to around 3 Septembers 2013, I became
         involved in the response to the emerging issues regarding Horizon.
                                                                                    WITNO8620100
                                                                                  WITNO8620100




22.   I did not acquire any criminal litigation experience or additional civil
      litigation experience (beyond my 6-month civil litigation seat whilst training)
      during my time at RMG or POL prior to separation. When contentious
      issues arose whilst I was Head of Legal of POL Legal prior to separation,
      those issues would simply have been dealt with by the relevant member of
      the RMG legal team.


23,   In the run up to separation on 1 April 2012, I undertook a large amount of
      work preparing for the separation of POL from RMG, including, in
      particular, participating in negotiations opposite RMG, together with the
      recruitment of new staff in anticipation of separation.


24,   It was known that after separation POL Legal would split from the other
      RMG legal teams, and Susan Crichton would officially become General
      Counsel for POL, having essentially been the de-facto General Counsel
      since she had started.


25.   On 1 April 2012, separation of POL from RMG took place. Although my
      employer changed, my title remained the same. I was not in the office for
      the first few weeks post-separation, because very sadly my father passed
      away unexpectedly on 2 April 2012 and so I was not fully engaged back at
      POL until the end of April 2012.


26    Post-separation, POL Legal was required to cover a wide range of areas
      including financial services, telecoms, public procurement, state aid and
      competition, commercial contracts, IP, data, and property, along with civil
      and criminal litigation.


27,   Post-separation, I continued to be based in the Old Street office with POL
      Legal. The office was open plan. I worked 4 days a week, on Monday to
      Thursday.    I continued to work under Susan Crichton's guidance and
      reported to her. Susan Crichton worked 5 days a week. As a general
                                                                                       WITNO8620100
                                                                                      WITN08620100




      working style, it was common for me to escalate issues to, and discuss
      them with, Susan Crichton for her to make a decision on, and to keep her
      generally aware of issues. I continued to be involved in recruitment and
      arranging for law firm secondees to help bolster the team. By the end of
      2012, we had grown the team to about a dozen lawyers from its original
      POL Legal base of around 4.


28.   In the run up to separation, I had asked Susan Crichton if we should get on
      and recruit a new criminal lawyer to join the POL Legal team. I was told by
      her that it had been agreed at a high level that POL Legal would inherit a
      member of the RMG Criminal Law Team. Rob Wilson, the Head of the
      RMG Criminal Law Team, identified Jarnail Singh as one of the senior
      lawyers in the RMG team pre-separation, who had been in the team for a
      number of years, and post separation he transferred to POL Legal to
      become the sole criminal lawyer.


29.   The HR headcount template allowed for one in-house criminal lawyer in
      POL Legal, but our budget permitted support from external lawyers. To
      this end, I understood that Cartwright King had been recommended to
      Susan Crichton by Rob Wilson as external lawyers who had previously
      worked with the RMG Criminal Law Team. I do not recall when Cartwright
      King first became involved in assisting with prosecutions and I was not
      involved in instructing Cartwright King (they were in place by the time I had
      returned following my father's funeral and so I was unaware of the precise
      remit of their retainer and the detail of the initial discussions with them).


30.   Susan Crichton dealt with the initial conversations with Jarnail Singh when
      he joined POL Legal, and I think I first met Jarnail Singh in around late April
      or early May 2012. I did not have any real involvement with Cartwright
      King until the months following separation and I have set out my
      recollection of the scope of this below.


31.   When informed that a criminal lawyer was transferring over, I recall having
                                    Page 7 of 56
                                                                                       WITNO8620100
                                                                                  WITNO8620100




      a discussion with Susan Crichton about who Jarnail Singh would sit under,
      given that I had no experience of criminal litigation. She indicated that the
      POL lawyers all had to sit under me as Head of Legal, as that was how the
      HR structure dictated it.


32.   I also remember querying with Susan Crichton who would supervise Jarnail
      Singh as the whole area of criminal law was foreign to me and something
      of which I had had no experience. She explained that she would run with
      the prosecutions, in conjunction with Jarnail Singh, using Cartwright King
      (and other external counsel) as external advisors as appropriate. She had
      been involved where necessary on issues relating to prosecutions pre-
      separation and so this was a continuation of the status quo. Jarnail Singh
      therefore reported to me for normal management issues, such as approval
      of annual leave and salary reviews etc., but in terms of criminal
      prosecutions was supervised by Susan Crichton.


33,   While I did not supervise Jarnail Singh on the prosecutions, he sometimes
      involved me on emails, rather than Susan Crichton. Although I asked him
      to be mindful of this, I would try to progress matters where possible on the
      occasions when this happened.         Equally, at some points in time, for
      example when Susan Crichton was on annual leave, and particularly when
      POL Legal began to respond to the emerging issues regarding Horizon at
      the end of June 2013, I would try to progress matters where possible in her
      absence.


34.   One-on-one meetings that I had with Jarnail Singh related to the discussion
      of any personnel-related issues, for example, he was not used to typing his
      own documents and this was a significant point of change for him. I did
      not discuss the detail of the criminal proceedings with him. As a result, I
      did not have day-to-day knowledge of individual prosecutions.               In
      particular, I was not aware of the specifics of particular prosecutions, and I
      would not authorise decisions to charge.        Until I was involved in the
      preparation of the relevant policy in March 2013, i also did not have any
                                   Page 8 of 56
                                                                                      WITNO8620100
                                                                                WITN08620100




      knowledge of the process through which POL decided if a prosecution
      should be commenced. Even then, my involvement was at the policy level
      rather than in the practical application of the policy.


35.   Immediately post-separation, POL Legal had a litigation secondee from
      Bond Pearce to assist with civil litigation matters. Bond Pearce became
      Bond Dickinson from 1 May 2013. The name is used interchangeably
      within this witness statement. In September 2012, Rodric Williams began
      at POL Legal to advise on civil litigation matters.       The Bond Pearce
      secondee had produced monthly litigation reports, and these became
      rebadged as the Significant Litigation Reports once Rodric Williams arrived
      (see paragraph 42 below).


36.   I have been asked to comment on my understanding of LPP when I joined
      RMG and POL. I understood LPP to apply to confidential communications
      between myself and POL employees and agents, either in the context of
      providing legal advice or where litigation was happening or contemplated.


37.   I had a good working relationship with Susan Crichton. She was calm and
      approachable and always available to escalate matters to for guidance,
      approval or a decision.


38.   I have been asked to comment on the adequacy and competency of the
      RMG and POL legal departments. During my time at RMG and POL,
      understood the legal departments to be adequate and competent and have
      set out some further reflections on these issues in the `General' section
      below.    I recall on one occasion (which I assume was shortly after
      separation), in the context of Jarnail Singh having delivered training to the
      investigators in the POL Security Team with help from Cartwright King,
      Cartwright King provided positive feedback regarding Jarnail Singh's
      competency. Jarnail Singh was a pleasant person who got on with the rest
      of the team.

39.   Chris Aujard joined POL Legal as interim General Counsel on or around
      the week commencing 14 October 2013, as a successor to Susan Crichton.
      He was briefed by Susan Crichton shortly afterwards and took over
      management of the criminal proceedings from her. He made it clear to me
      from the outset that he was taking over all Horizon matters.




40.   1 only occasionally attended POL's monthly board meetings. Sometimes,
      but by no means always, to deputise for Susan Crichton at her request or
      following an invitation to speak regarding a specific topic (and always in
      each case following a full briefing from her).


41.   I have been provided with a copy of the POL board minutes from a meeting
      held on 21 November 2012 (P0L00027553). I was invited to attend this
      meeting to speak regarding Project Rainbow, and the minutes show that I
      only attended for this item (1121117) (page 1 of P0L00027553). I believe
      this was a data protection issue and not relevant to Horizon. The minutes
      also show that Fay Healey, Chief HR Officer, was deputising for Susan
      Crichton (page 1 of P0L00027553). Indeed, it was never automatic that I
      would deputise for Susan Crichton. The `Items for Noting' section shows
      that Alwen Lyons (Company Secretary) gave the board a brief update on
      Second Sight's progress with their Horizon work (page 6 of P0L0027553).


42    I have considered an email chain from 11 and 12 September 2012, relating
      to monthly litigation reports for the board (POL00181607). Helen Perkins,
      Assistant Company Secretary at POL, emailed Rodric Williams and Jarnail
      Singh to request that they "update the report on litigation for [her] . . .for the
      board pack' (page 3 of P0L00131607). This was a request to prepare
      Significant Litigation Reports for the board to update them in respect of civil
      and criminal proceedings. These were prepared by the relevant people
      from the criminal and civil litigation teams, as the subject matter experts.
      Helen subsequently commented on Jarnail Singh's report in an email to
                                        ♦   !♦

                                                                                       WITNO8620100




          Alwen Lyons and me, dated 12 September 2012. 1 replied stating that I
          could "see the spelling, formatting etc. [issues]" (page 1 of POL00181607).
          I asked to see the finished version so that I could give Jarnail Singh advice
          regarding the form of the reports (rather than the substance or the content).
          This is an example of the type of management I was involved in regarding
          Jarnail Singh. In this instance, I would have gone through the feedback
          from the business with him. This type of issue would not have caused me
          wider concern about Jarnail Singh; I anticipated that he had just not been
          involved in the preparation of this type of report before.


  43.     I have also been provided with a copy of the agenda from an Executive
          Committee meeting on 16 September 2013 (POL00295988). This was
          soon after I returned from a sabbatical. I was deputising for Susan Crichton
          at this meeting and I would have received a full briefing from her prior to
          the meeting. I am not listed as a specific sponsor or presenter and Angela
          Van Den Bogerd presented the Horizon update.


KNOWLEDGE OF HORIZON

   44.    During 2009, I became aware of the Horizon IT system by virtue of my
          involvement in relevant contractual work, in conjunction with external law
          firms.


   45.    I recall receiving a high-level briefing on the Horizon contract in my first
          month at RMG.


   46.    It was intended that all POL employees would have training on Horizon so
          that they could assist with strike cover i.e. if branch staff took strike action
          then they could operate the Horizon system. However, I never received
          this training because of availability clashes.         As a result, I never
          experienced the Horizon system and had no awareness of how it operated.


   47.;   I cannot recall receiving any briefing or training on the migration to Horizon

48.   When I joined RMG, I cannot recall being informed of any Horizon issues
      including bugs, errors or defects; a lack of integrity; or complaints or
      concerns.


49.   I have set out throughout my witness statement when my knowledge of
      bugs, errors and defects materially changed.




51.   I cannot recall being aware of the ability of Fujitsu employees to alter
      transaction data or data in branch accounts without the knowledge or
      consent of SPMs (i.e. remote access) whilst I was employed by RMG

      not remember the detail of discussions I had (if any) with individuals within
      RMG and POL about the article (including, in particular, anyone in the Civil
      Litigation Team or Criminal Law Team, who were dealing with the relevant
      cases).

55.   In relation to the 2011 E&Y report (P0L00030217), I cannot recall having
      read this document. The letter was addressed to Sarah Hall at POL.




56.   I have been asked to consider an email chain with David Jones and others
      on 3 February 2010 (FUJ00152903), and an email chain with Jarnail Singh
      and others dated 21 October 2010 (POL00055590).


57.   The 3 February 2010 email chain shows that David Jones, a lawyer at
      Fujitsu, asked me if I could find out who was dealing with a particular matter
      at POL. As I was not previously aware of this matter, I made some
      enquiries. It appears that Mark Dinsdale, Security Team Manager,
      confirmed that it was Jarnail Singh. I also do not recall that I had come
      across Jarnail Singh before this point in time, and I do not recall speaking
      to him about this matter (I was merely passing on his email details).


58.   I have been provided with a copy of an expert witness statement of Gareth
      Jenkins of Fujitsu, dated 8 October 2010 (POL00129960)_ This witness
      statement appears to have been prepared in relation to the Seema Misra
      case. I do not recall seeing this witness statement at the time and there
      would have been no reason for me to have done so.


59.   I do not remember receiving any further communications in relation to the
      Seema Misra case in the period between the above email chain on 3
      February 2010 and 21 October 2010, when Jarnail Singh confirmed the
      outcome of the trial to various parties (POL00055590).


60.   I do not have any recollection of any so-called °attack' on Horizon before
      this email chain. My understanding of the email would have likely been
      that there were not any problems with Horizon and the "unprecedented"
      attack had been defended.

61.   1 have been asked to consider a number of documents relating to claims
      intimated by Shoosmiths J Access Legal from 2011, when the RMG Civil
      Litigation Team was handling these matters.


62.   I cannot recall seeing the letter of claim, dated 23 August 2011, regarding
      Mr Julian Wilson (POL00046944). It was addressed to POL, but would
      likely have been directed to RMG's Civil Litigation Team, as there was no
      litigation expertise in POL Legal at this time.


63.   I have considered an email chain from 1 September 2011 to 15 September
      2011 (POL00056928).        It appears that on 1 September 2011, Emily
      Springford, Principal Lawyer— Dispute Resolution, who was in RMG's Civil
      Litigation Team, was attempting to locate an agency file. She requested
      assistance from John Longman, Security Manager, who raised issues
      relating to his capacity to assist. She escalated her request for assistance
      to Rebekah Mantle, Head of the RMG Civil Litigation Team, and Rebekah
      Mantle contacted Sabrina Jethwa and Susan Crichton. Being relatively
      new and junior, Sabrina Jethwa in turn referred the issue to me and
      emailed John Scott (who headed the POL Security Team, which amongst
      other things conducted investigations into Horizon issues) on 8 September,
      asking if John Longman could be made available_ My limited involvement
      was in relation to this one resourcing point, rather than the substantive work
      required.


64.   By this time in late 2011, 1 must have been aware that there had been some
      complaints about Horizon in the past, and that complaints were being made
      again, as I comment, "We are starting to have these cases come in again
      on Horizon" (page 2 of POL00056928).              I cannot recall where this
      knowledge originated from or when.


65,   I believe that the comment regarding saving fees (`'Apparently having Jon

                                                                              WITNO8620100




      Longman help us is saving us hundreds of thousands in external fees")
      was a message from the RMG Civil Litigation Team. It is likely that I would
      have asked that team for more information on the background to their
      request, to understand why it was needed or how important it was. I cannot
      recall previously being aware of Mr Longman or his work.


66.   On 15 September 2011, I emailed John Scott again, stating that I "am being
      chased by my li[igation] colleagues.. successfully defending these claims
      is key to POL" (page 1 of P0L00056928). I believe that the phrase "key to
      POL" was used because I understood from the RMG Civil Litigation Team
      that it was an important issue which needed to be dealt with.          The
      understanding at RMG / POL at that time was that the system was robust
      so it was logical and important that these claims be defended.


67.   Susan Crichton was copied into my email to keep her informed and
      because she was senior to me and would help ensure that John Longman
      was made available to the RMG Civil Litigation Team.


68.   I have considered an email from Emily Springford (of the RMG Civil
      Litigation Team, who were dealing with these matters at this time and until
      separation) to various recipients, dated 20 October 2011, regarding POL
      receiving four letters of claim from SPMs which included allegations
      regarding the Horizon system (P0L00176465). The email primarily relates
      to the need to ensure document preservation. Although I was sent this
      email, I have no specific recollection of it.


69.   I have considered a note of a conference with Richard Morgan QC of
      Maitland Chambers, dated 26 October 2011, prepared by Bond Pearce
      (P0L00107695). Bond Pearce would have been instructed by the RMG
      Civil Litigation Team.


70.   The attendees from RMG were from the Civil Litigation Team, along with
      Sabrina Jethwa from POL Legal (who was a non-contentious lawyer
                                    Page 15 of 56

                                                                                      WITNO8620100




      assisting with SPM contracts at this point). I was not an attendee at this
      conference. I do not recall receiving any briefing on the occurrence or
      outcome of this conference. I do not know to what extent the RMG Civil
      Litigation Team followed Mr Morgan QC's advice. I was focused primarily
      on separation negotiations at this time (as well as business-as-usual work)
      and I would not have had involvement in civil litigation matters in any event.


71.   1 have also been provided with a copy of a document with the title, "Briefing
      note on the current status of claims involving Horizon", said to be prepared
      by `Legal Services', dated 12 March 2012 (POLOOO58211). It is likely that
      this was a briefing note prepared by RMG's Civil Litigation Team
      immediately prior to separation to assist with the transfer of the civil
      litigation files to POL. I cannot recall, but it is likely that I saw this document
      because of the impending separation.            The report describes five civil
      claims. The briefing note stated that: (i) the Horizon system was 'robust";
      (ii) the system had been "rigorously tested"; (iii) it had been in use for 10
      years with 20,000 SPMs having used it "to successfully perform millions of
      financial reconciliations", and (iv) the National Federation of SPMs had
      "also expressed its full confidence in the accuracy and robustness of
      Horizon". The briefing note referred to a claim being struck out and the
      relevant SPM being refused leave to appeal.


72.   There was a further conference with Richard Morgan QC of Maitland
      Chambers on 12 June 2012. 1 have considered the note of the conference
      prepared by Bond Pearce (POL00006484). This conference occurred two
      months post-separation and I can see that I attended the conference with
      Susan Crichton. As POL Legal was being supported by a Bond Dickinson
      secondee post-separation in relation to civil litigation (Rodric Williams had
      yet to arrive at POL Legal), Susan Crichton and I attended.


73.   I do not remember this conference.             I recall that Bond Pearce had
      recommended a Chancery QC, which may have been Richard Morgan QC.
      The note of the conference records that "an impasse has been reached in
                                     Page 16 of 56
                                                                                        WITNO8620100
                                                                                   WITNO8620100




         relation to the Horizon litigation which POL is seeking to address. The
         question is what is the best way of breaking that impasse" (page 1 of
         POL00006484).      Mr Morgan QC raised a number of salient issues to
         consider, including concerns regarding the potential for the "floodgates" to
         be opened to civil claims, and was happy to explain these issues to the
         board directly. I understood that the system was robust and therefore the
         likelihood of the floodgates opening was minimal.


  74.    The note of the conference goes on to state that the "proposal to instruct
         an Independent expert to prepare a report on the Horizon system is the
         highest risk response to the issue" (page 1 of P0L00006484). I do not recall
         the genesis of the proposal to instruct an independent expert, other than
         by this time I was generally aware that concerns had been raised by MPs
         on behalf of their constituents, and consideration was being given to how
         POL should respond. I do not remember meeting with MPs and believe
         that this would have occurred at Susan Crichton's level, or above. Mr
         Morgan QC stated that a "less risky approach is to agree to take the
         relevant MP's privately through particular cases in which they are
         interested'.   POL would have wanted to take advice on the available
         options before a decision was made at board level (and this was an
         example of that); POL could have been criticised either way, including, for
         example, a suggestion that there had been a knee-jerk reaction to political
         pressure. Ultimately, POL was not swayed by the risks, including the point
         raised by Mr Morgan QC regarding "open[ing] the floodgates to damages
         claims", (page 1 of POL00006484) and subsequently instructed Second
         Sight as an independent expert in early summer 2012.


INSTRUCTION OF SECOND SIGHT AND ONGOING LITIGATION


   75.   I understood that the purpose of the Second Sight review of the Horizon
         system was a thorough independent review to identify any issues with
         Horizon which might highlight problems with a prosecution or civil claim.


                                      Page 17 of 56
                                                                                    WITNO8620100
                                                                                  WITNO8620100




76.    I welcomed the Horizon review as it appeared a sensible step for POL to
      take following the concerns which had been raised. I thought that if there
      were any issues, Second Sight would highlight them, and the concerns
      would be resolved.


77.   I recall that Susan Crichton recommended Second Sight, because prior to
      joining POL she had worked with a colleague at General Electric who
      subsequently joined, or helped set up, Second Sight. I was not involved in
      the identification of Second Sight, or (as far as I can recall) its engagement,
      scope or remit.


78.   I have been provided with copies of three overlapping email chains from 9
      to 11 July 2012 (P0L00180855, POL00180846 and POL00141398). The
      emails relate to a criminal prosecution of a SPM, Ms Wylie. The chain
      begins with a lawyer from Cartwright King, Rachael Panter, emailing Andy
      Cash of Cartwright King, regarding a letter received from the defence
      solicitors asking for Cartwright King's position in relation to the ongoing
      Horizon investigation, which I took to be a reference to the involvement of
      Second Sight.


79,   Andy Cash forwarded the email to Jarnail Singh, who would have been
      dealing with the prosecution at POL, seeking details of how to respond.
      Jarnail Singh forwarded the chain to Susan Crichton and me on 9 July
      2012. Jarnail Singh's email stated that he had "raised this with you and
      briefly discussed this with Hugh last week with our possible approach or
      view' (page 2 of POL001 80855). I have no recollection of this discussion.


80.   On 9 July 2012, Susan Crichton emailed me to let me know that "[Jarnail
      Singh] says that he is coming up with a plan... suspect may be quicker as
      you suggested to go to Counsel for views, suspect we could use the junior
      at the [Bond Pearce] meeting to do a quick wr►tten opinion" (page 1 of
      POL00180846). I replied stating, "[I] think I'll look up criminal sets as I
      wasn't bowled over by the [Bond Pearce] ones" (page 1 of POL00180846).
                                   Page 18 of 56

81    Jarnail Singh subsequently emailed Susan Crichton and me, providing
      further views on the position and stating that he needed "more information
      and advice to address these concerns" (page 2 of POL001180855). I replied
      on 10 July stating, "are you able to advise Susan and / on this or do you
      want to go to Counsel' (page 1 of P0L00180855). We were attempting to
      ensure that there was appropriate external resource in place to support
      Jarnail Singh. Jarnail Singh replied, stating that with "steer and stance, i
      can then advice [sic] [Cartwright King] and have input from them" (page 3
      of P0L00141398). A meeting was arranged with Susan Crichton, Alwen
      Lyons, Jarnail Singh and me (page 2 of P0L00141398).


82.   On 11 July 2012, Jarnail Singh emailed Susan Crichton, Alwen Lyons and
      me, setting out a number of questions regarding the remit and scope of
      Second Sight (page 1 of POL00141398).


83.   On 11 July 2012, timed at 12:22, Andy Cash of Cartwright King emailed
      Jarnail Singh (POL00143379), attaching a copy of an advice note by Harry
      Bowyer of Cartwright King, dated 11 July 2012 (P0L00026567).


84.   Mr Bowyer described there being "apocryphal evidence on the internet and
      elsewhere that the [Horizon] system was leading to injustice" (page 1 of
      POL00026567). He referred to the instruction of Second Sight and stated
      that "an expert should be identified and instructed to prepare a generic
      statement which confirms the integrity of the system and why the attacks
      so far have been unfounded" (page 3 of P0L00026567). Mr Bowyer also
      stated that he presumed that "our thinking [in instructing Second Sight] was
      that as we have nothing to hide we have no objection to our practices being
      scrutinised in which case we should say so" (page 3 of P0L00026567).


85,   Jarnail Singh provided the advice note of Cartwright King's Mr Bowyer to
      Susan Crichton and me on 16 July 2012 at 11:24 (page 1 of
                                                                                    WITNO8620100
                                                                               WITNO8620100




86,   Mr Bowyer described the consequences of the integrity of the system being
      compromised as "catastrophic" (page 2 of POL00026567).                 The
      implications of a problem with Horizon were obvious, but at the time POL's
      thinking was that the Horizon system was robust. Despite the floodgate'
      risk that had been flagged during the conference with Richard Morgan QC
      on 12 June 2012, POL had resolved to instruct Second Sight. If there was
      substance to the concerns, convictions would be questioned, and unjust
      ones overturned. However, I understood from a conversation with Jarnail
      Singh, at some point in time shortly after separation, that Gareth Jenkins
      was the Fujitsu Horizon guru involved in the cases. Jarnail Singh also said
      that in 99.9% of cases there was other evidence of theft, and so it was not
      apparent that many cases solely relied on Horizon data (see paragraph
      93).


87.   There is a related email chain (POL00141400), dated 16 July 2012,
      regarding applications for stays of prosecutions whilst Second Sight was
      undertaking its work_ I cannot recall how these discussions concluded.


88.   I emaiied Jarnail Singh on 16 July 2012, timed at 11:33, having considered
      Cartwright King's advice. I noted that I assumed that Jarnail Singh would
      be the single point of contact that case officers could approach, as
      proposed by Cartwright King i.e. a disclosure officer (page 1 of
      POL00143379). Jarnail Singh replied referring to a need to "provide extra
      evidence as defence would put us to proof as to the systems integrity'
      (page 1 of POL00143379) and stating that the "only way to fully comply
      with prosecution disclosure obligations would be to instruct an expert at
      Fujitsu" (page 1 of POL00143379).


89.   At 13:00 on 16 July 2012, Jarnail Singh emailed Susan Crichton and me,
      asking if we were "happy with our stance" (page 2 of POLOO141400). It
      appears that Susan Crichton, Jarnail Singh, Alwen Lyons and I already had
      a meeting planned at 3:30pm on 16 July 2012, as I replied, copying Susan

                                                                               WITNO8620100




      Crichton and Alwen Lyons, stating "one for our 3.30 meeting I think' (page
      1 of P0L00141400).        I asked Jarnail Singh to confirm that "your
      recommendation hasn't changed and is still to keep fighting any such [stay]
      application?". I set out a list of the issues arising from Cartwright King's
      advice, including a reference to "a plan/bible of what information we are
      going to provide. . . if we have to fight applications to stay" (page 1 of
      POL00141400). I was attempting to distil Cartwright King's advice into
      action points to ensure that Jarnail Singh was appropriately considering the
      issues raised when recommending a way forward regarding stay
      applications. Jarnail Singh replied at 14:26, confirming that by now he had
      briefly spoken with Susan Crichton.


90.   I cannot recall how any discussion concluded, however I believe that
      ultimately the involvement of Helen Rose (Fraud Analyst) as a disclosure
      officer flowed from the discussions at this time. On 25 July 2012, Joanne
      Hancock, Senior Security Programme Manager, emailed Jarnail Singh,
      confirming that "Helen Rose from the POL Security Team has been
      nominated" (POL00141406).


91    I have been provided with an email chain dated August 2012
      (P0L00141416), in which Helen Rose emailed Jarnail Singh regarding her
      role as disclosure officer. The date of the email does not appear in the
      copy provided to me. Jarnail Singh subsequently asked Cartwright King to
      look at the information which Helen had collated and advise "in readiness
      to instruct an expert as part of providing an advance pack disclosure" (page
      1 of POL00141416). Cartwright King replied that the information provided
      "appears to be what we want' i.e. flowing from the 11 July 2012 advice
      note. Harry Bowyer provided a list of 4 matters that an expert report would
      need to address (page 1 of P0L00141416). It does not appear that I
      received this email and I was already away on annual leave from the
      evening of Thursday 2 August 2012.


92.   Helen Rose and Jarnail Singh continued discussions regarding Helen's
                                                                                           WITN08620100
                                                                                      WITNO8620100




      work in August 2012 (POL00020489). On 11 September 2012, Jarnail
      Singh sent Helen's final report on her analysis of Horizon cases to Andy
      Cash and Andrew Bolc at Cartwright King, and requested their comments
      before "forwarding the data loran expert report" (page 2 of P0L00020489).
      Andy Cash replied and confirmed that in Harry Bowyer's view, if the report
      was comprehensive, it was what was needed. He stated "we now need
      the experts report on it as soon as practcable [sic]. . ." (page 1 of
      P0L00020489). Jarnail Singh queried whether to use Gareth Jenkins of
      Fujitsu as previously or "somebody entirely independent' (page 1 of
      P0L00020489). Harry Bowyer replied confirming that having an entirely
      independent expert would be preferable but practically difficult in the
      timescales, and referred back to his July advice regarding the contents of
      the report (page 1 of P0L00020489). I was not copied into this email, but
      it seems to me, looking at this email chain now, that Jarnail Singh was
      continuing to follow Cartwright King's advice.




93.   On 21 October 2010, Jarnail Singh mentioned in his email (which, as in
      paragraph 59 above, I was copied into) regarding the Seema Misra trial
      "the   considerable     expertise    of     Gareth   Jenkins.. ."   (page   1   of
      P0L00055590). At some point in time, shortly after separation, Jarnail
      Singh explained to me that Gareth Jenkins was the Fujitsu Horizon `guru',
      and he had been used to provide evidence in prosecutions of SPMs.


94.   On 13 September 2012, Jarnail Singh emailed Penny Thomas at Fujitsu,
      seeking the expert that had been suggested previously by Cartwright King
      (P0L00181611). It now appears that Jarnail Singh copied and pasted into
      his email the 4 items which Cartwright King had advised the expert should
      address   per   Harry     Bowyer's        email,   dated   August    2012   (see
      P0L00141416). I forwarded Jarnail Singh's email to Lesley Sewell, Chief
      Information Officer (because it was a Fujitsu matter), and Susan Crichton
      because she would need to be aware of this.

                                                                               WITNO8620100




95.   On 1 October 2012, Jarnail Singh emailed Gareth Jenkins at Fujitsu
      (P0L00096985). It again appears that he copied and pasted the 4 items
      which Cartwright King had advised the expert should address per Harry
      Bowyer's email, dated August 2012 (see P0L00141416). It appears that
      Penny Thomas at Fujitsu had directed Jarnail Singh to Gareth Jenkins. I
      was copied into this email and understood that Jarnail Singh was following
      Cartwright King's advice.


96.   Gareth Jenkins emailed Jarnail Singh on 1 October 2012, attaching two
      reports regarding Horizon and Horizon Online Integrity. He said that he
      would "try to produce a further short report addressing your specific points
      below'.    On 2 October 2012, Gareth Jenkins emailed Jarnail Singh
      (P0L00096985)       attaching    the   further    report   (POL00129957,
      POL00129958 & P0L00129959). He also attached his witness statement
      from the Misra case. I do not remember looking at these documents at the
      time. I was aware that the criminal litigation experts, Cartwright King, had
      recommended this report and POL had obtained the report as a result. I
      would have expected Jarnail Singh to liaise with Cartwright King to confirm
      if anything further was required or for Cartwright King to raise any issues
      with the report.


97.   1 became more aware of Gareth Jenkins as a result of the above
      developments in 2012, but I never worked directly with him.




98.   On 12 December 2012, I emailed Susan Crichton and Alwen Lyons
      (POL00122000) a working draft of a board paper regarding the future of
      criminal prosecutions (POL00122001). The recommendation section was
      blank and the sponsor of the paper was Susan Crichton (page 7 of
      P0L00122001). My email contained a reference to the paper having "been
      through" John (John Scott, Head of Security) and the law firm DAC
                                   Page 23 of 56
                                                                                    WITNO8620100
                                                                                WITNO8620100




       Beachcroft. I cannot now recall why DAC Beachcroft was involved, but
       POL may have wanted an entirely new firm to consider the issue and other
      implications of the policy.


99.    It appears that I was asked to help prepare a draft of the paper with the
      input of others. I may not have sent it to Jarnail Singh because the proposal
      could have led to his redundancy and so there would have been some
      sensitivity. I recall that John Scott's view was that the police and CPS
      would not prosecute these cases for POL, but I cannot recall any
      discussion about the pros and cons of the CPS taking over the prosecution
      function.


100. The purpose of the draft board paper was stated as being to "outline the
      benefits and disadvantages of the current [prosecution] approach" and
      "provide a number of alternative approaches for consideration" (page 1 of
      POL00122001).       The paper annexed the current prosecution policy
      statement, effective from 1 April 2012, owned by Jarnail Singh, with the
      review of the policy due by 1 April 2013 (page 8 of POL00122001).
      believe that this policy was largely based on RMG's existing pre-separation
      policy. The prompt for the board paper therefore may have been the
      prosecution policy's impending April 2013 review date; such review date
      would most likely have been diarised by Alwen Lyons, the company
      secretary.


101. On 5 March 2013, prior to the April 2013 review date of POL's prosecution
      policy, I emailed John Scott, Susan Crichton, Jarnail Singh and Alwen
      Lyons (P0L00122166), attaching a copy of a "redraft. . . following our last
      meeting" (page 1 of POL00122166) of a new draft criminal enforcement
      and prosecution policy. This occurred having taken on board comments
      from John Scott's team (POL Security Team); the policy was redrafted
      based on views collated from the various subject matter experts
      (POL00030621). I asked if there were any more comments or if everyone
      now agreed with the draft. I cannot recall how this stage concluded.
                                                                                      WITN08620100
                                                                                WITNO8620100




  102. I have been provided with a copy of Helen Rose's draft report, 'Horizon
        Data Lepton SPSO 191320', dated 12 June 2013 (FUJ00086811).


  103. I cannot recall how this report came to be created or who it was
       commissioned by, and I do not recall reading this document, but I can see
        that I am copied into a subsequent email chain on 10 and 11 July 2013
        along with Susan Crichton and Jarnail Singh (POL00323842).


  104. This report raised concerns that POL "cannot clearly see what has
       happened on the data available to us and this in itself may be
         misinterpreted when giving evidence and using the same data for
         prosecutions" (page 3 of FUJ00086811). She also referred to an exchange
         with Gareth Jenkins in which she stated, "I know that you are aware of all
         of the Horizon integrity issues..." (page 3 of FUJ00086811).


   105. There is an overlap between Helen Rose's report and the identification of
        the two bugs which Gareth Jenkins disclosed to Second Sight. POL's
         response to these issues is considered below.


SECOND SIGHT INTERIM REPORT


   106. I cannot recall any involvement in POL's decision making regarding how to
        respond to Lord Arbuthnot MP, Alan Bates and The Justice for
         Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA), including any negotiations concerning
         the inclusion of JFSA cases in the Second Sight review.


   107. I cannot recall any involvement in POL's response to Second Sight's
        requests for information and / or the investigation of spot reviews leading
         to their interim report.

108. Susan Crichton was the contact at POL Legal who was updated formally
       on the progress of Second Sight's work. I recall her telling me at some
        point that Second Sight had not identified any issues yet but I cannot recall
       when this was.
          ....... ................

109. On 27 June 2013 at 19:51, Rodric Williams emailed various recipients
       including Lesley Sewell (CIO), Alwen Lyons, Rod Ismay, and Jarnail Singh
       (page 1 of P0L00029622). POL, with assistance from Bond Dickinson,
       was preparing letters to 14 affected branches to disclose the existence of
       a Horizon bug. Rodric Williams stated that there was a need for POL Legal
       to "do a final cross check of the intended recipients to make sure they are
       not the subject of prosecutions/investigations" (page 2 of P0L00029622).
       It is clear from Rodric Williams's email on 3 July 2013 (see POL00145142
       at paragraph 129 below), that POL was obtaining legal advice from
       Cartwright King regarding the mechanics of disclosure in criminal cases to
       ensure that its obligations were properly satisfied (POL00145145).


110.    As far as I can recall, I became aware of two bugs with the Horizon
       system, which were subsequently mentioned in the Second Sight interim
       report, on or about Friday 28 June 2013. One of the bugs affected 14
       branches (the `local suspense' bug) and the other affected 64 branches
       (the `receipts and payments mismatch' bug).


111. On 28 June 2013, at 10:15, Lesley Sewell received information from Gareth
       Jenkins of Fujitsu (his witness statement from the Seema Misra case)
       (POL00098812).                Lesley forwarded this on to Alwen Lyons, Martin
       Edwards (Chief of Staff to the Chief Executive) and Mark Davies (Head of
       Communications) at 11:30 (page 1 of P0L00098812).                Mark Davies
       wanted to establish whether the 14 and 64 bugs had been referenced in
       Court (page 1 of P0L00098812). Alwen sent the email chain to me at
       17:29 on the same day, asking if we could check if the 14 branch and 64
       branch bugs had been referred to in Court or if it would be quicker to
       contact Gareth Jenkins (page 1 of P0L00098812).

                                                                                 WITNO8620100




112. Gareth Jenkins' email on 28 June 2013 at 10:41 stated that the 14 branch
     bug had been first raised in February 2013, with the final set of information
      sent to POL on 15 March 2013 (page 4 of P0L00029648).


113. Subsequent emails with Gareth Jenkins between 28 June 2013 and 1 July
     2013 (POL00031351) clarified that a bug which affected the Falkirk branch
      had been raised in the Castleton and Misra cases, but Gareth Jenkins was
      not aware "of any other specific bug being discussed in Court (either
      related to Horizon or HNG-X)" (page 3 of P0L00031351).


114. On 28 June 2013 at 14:01, Rodric Williams emailed various recipients
     (POL00029622) attaching a paper which summarised the 14 and 64
      branch issues (POL00029623). I am copied into this email.


115. On Friday 28 June 2013, at 17:08, I emailed Alwen Lyons, Mark Davies,
     Rodric Williams, Jarnail Singh, and Lesley Sewell (POL00060572). I
      referred to a case commencing on Monday 1 July 2013 in Birmingham (this
      was the Balvinder Samra case, although I appear to have been unfamiliar
      with this name at the time). I must have spoken to Jarnail Singh before
      drafting this email as I would have been unfamiliar with the criminal case
      and procedural issues such as adjournments.         I explained that Jarnail
      Singh was to "get [Cartwright King] up to speed.. .to enable [Cartwright
      King] to say something to judge re bugs [Post Office] have found and
      disclosed _ _ . and fact that an Second Sight interim report may be coming out
      before MP summer recess (16 July) to offer judge the chance to adjourn
      the case" (page 2 of P0L00060572). The email records my thinking that it
      was prudent to be "open and transparent' (page 2 of P0L00060572).


116. The remainder of the email lists practical suggestions relating to preparing
      a communications statement and beginning fact finding to be able to take
      appropriate action. Specifically, I raised communications in relation to the

       Simon Baker (Head of PR) to confirm that there are no other bugs and
       "[Rodric Williams] / [Jarnail Singh] to confirm that no prosecutions relate to
       these bugs etc.". I was relying on Rodric Williams and Jarnail Singh to
       respectively consider the important civil and criminal implications outside
       of my knowledge and expertise, with assistance from Bond Dickinson and
       Cartwright King as appropriate. Jarnail Singh was getting Cartwright King
       up to speed to provide POL with specialist criminal advice regarding the
      developments.


117. I refer to "put[ting] it in context — size of incorrect balances vis a vis all the
       transactions we process a day etc". Although these limited bugs had been
      identified (as subsequently confirmed by the Second Sight report), POL's
      impression was still that the Horizon system was robust.


118. On Sunday 30 June 2013, at 18:00, Jarnail Singh replied to my 28 June
      2013 email above (POL00060572). He added the name of the defendant
      (Balvinder Samra) to the subject of my email. Jarnail Singh referred to
      discussions which had taken place with prosecution counsel, Cartwright
      King and Gareth Jenkins. Gareth Jenkins had confirmed that he had raised
      two Horizon bugs (I understand this to be the 14 and 64 branch issues)
      with Second Sight. The judge was to be updated the next day. Jarnail
      Singh noted      POL's duty to be "open and honest' (page 1 of




119. On 1 July 2013, I understand that I received an invitation to what was
      described as an                 Second Sight meeting (POL00296868). This
                        "emergency'




      meeting took place against the background of the discussions above
      regarding the 14 and 64 branch issues. The meeting was scheduled from
      12:00 until 13:30. I do not recall this meeting, but I sent an email at 13:16
      on the same day containing high level draft points for the board
      (POL00060587). I appear to have been contributing remotely by preparing
      a first draft of high-level notes which was sent following the meeting
      finishing early, in anticipation of my being out of the office in the afternoon.
                                                                                       WITN08620100
                                                                                 WITNO8620100




      I flag up that the note has gaps in it, and it is amended by Mark Davies at
      1:41 (page 1 of POL00060587). After that, I ask for someone else to
      continue to progress the note. I would also have updated Susan Crichton
      of any developments ahead of her 3pm meeting with Second Sight (page
      2 of POL00115919).


120. The version following Mark Davies' amendments (it is unclear which
      amendments were made by who in the version that I have seen) contained
      a reference to early indications being that Second Sight's interim report
      may say that there are no "systemic issues". The email referred to the 14
      and 64 branch bugs and potential issues regarding training. I would not
      have regarded these issues, in the context of 6 million transactions being
      processed a day across 11,800 branches, as being a systemic issue.
      There was also consideration given to instructing a consultancy firm such
      as Ernst & Young to review and improve POL's processes.


121. My understanding at the time was that Second Sight had been thoroughly
      investigating the Horizon system for a year and had not identified any
      systemic issues i.e. issues in terms of the overall robustness of the system
      in its interim report. I understood that the Horizon expert at Fujitsu, Gareth
      Jenkins, did not consider that there were any systemic issues either. I had
      also been previously assured by Jarnail Singh that the criminal cases were
      sound, and that in 99.9% of cases there was other evidence of wrongdoing
      (also see paragraph 124 below).


122. There was a high level of interest from politicians and the press at this time
      and therefore heightened sensitivity regarding the release of Second
      Sight's interim report.


123. Following the meeting on 1 July 2013, Rodric Williams circulated an
      updated draft briefing note for Paula Vennells regarding the implications of
      Second Sight's interim report (POL00115918) on 2 July 2013 to Leslie
      Sewell, Susan Crichton, Mark Davies, Aiwen Lyons, Martin Edwards,

                                                                                WITNO8620100




      Simon Baker, Jarnail Singh and me..


124. Paragraph 35 states that: "since separation, we have never had a
      successful prosecution which has relied solely on Horizon evidence to
      convict.   We have always had other evidence which contributed to the
      prosecution, e.g. the behaviour of SPM, failure to mention Horizon
      problems until trial, other staff using Horizon without incidenf' (page 6 of
      P0L00115919). This accords with the information which Jarnail Singh
      provided to me shortly after separation (see paragraphs 86 and 121
      above).


125. On 2 July 2013, Rodric Williams emailed Andrew Winn (POL IT), Andy
      Parsons (Bond Dickinson) and Rod Ismay, in the context of an email chain
      regarding the letters to the 14 branches affected by the local suspense
      issue' bug (POL00145142).       He stated that he needed to 'check the
      position on the Merthyr [Dyfan] one because of a criminal prosecution".


126. On 3 July 2013, Lesley Sewell requested more information on the local
      suspense issue, which was provided by Gareth Jenkins (P0L00029648).
      The information was then shared with Rod Ismay, who looped in Rodric
      Williams (POL00029648). Rodric Williams provided more information on
      the timeline, per a call with Andy Winn.


127. On 3 July 2013, Martin Edwards emailed Alice Perkins and Paula Vennells
      a briefing note for a meeting with Lord Arbuthnot MP on the same day
      (POL00098898). It appears that the briefing note is likely to have extracted
      the comment on prosecutions not solely relying on Horizon evidence from
      paragraph 35 of the earlier briefing          note dated    2 July 2013
      (POL00115919). I do not recall being involved in the preparation of this
      document, and I note I am not expressly thanked in Martin's email (others
      were).


128. I have been asked to what extent I agreed with the following quote (from
                                                                                     WITNO8620100
                                                                                WITNO8620100




      P0L00098898): "No reason to believe [the identification of two
      "exceptions"] means there [were] other undiscovered issues". There was
      nothing to indicate that any other undiscovered issues existed, and if there
      were I would have expected them to be identified by Second Sight activity
      going forward.


129. On 3 July 2013, Rodric Williams emailed Martin Smith and Simon Clarke
      of Cartwright King, requesting their advice regarding disclosure to defence
      counsel of the 14 branch issue, following a conference earlier that day
      (pages 1 and 2 of P0L00145142).         Rodric Williams also clarified the
      timeline of the 14 branch issue and asked if that affected Cartwright King's
      advice. I can see that I chased responses to Rodric Williams's questions
      as Susan Crichton and I were due to brief POL's CEO (page 1 of
      P0L00145142). It is apparent that consideration of the impact on Gareth
      Jenkins as an expert witness had begun by this stage (page 1 of
      POL00145142). The involvement of Cartwright King was a continuation of
      the process which had begun in late June 2013, following POL Legal
      becoming aware of the two bugs.


130. I do not recall if I attended the Cartwright King conference on 3 July 2013.


131. On 4 July 2013, 1 forwarded Rodric Williams's email dated 3 July 2013 to
      Martin Smith and Simon Clarke, both of Cartwright King, and copied Susan
      Crichton (POL00098984).         I forwarded the     local suspense issue'
      information on to Martin Smith and Simon Clarke because I was aware that
      Jarnail Singh was getting them up to speed with developments and I was
      trying to help pull everyone and all the information together so that
      Cartwright King had all the information they required to provide their advice
      and that POL Legal were progressing everything appropriately.          I was
      taking what I regarded as a practical approach to help the business work
      through the issues and obtain the right advice. Ultimately, what followed
      was advice being received from Cartwright King, including Simon Clarke's
      advice note dated 15 July 2013.

132. On 4 July 2013, 1 emailed Martin Smith and Simon Clarke of Cartwright
      King, copied to Jarnail Singh, Susan Crichton, Rodric Williams and Andy
      Cash, a "first rough draft from Second Sight with one half of the Interim
      Report'. I asked for "material and significant concerns" i.e. concerns at a
      high level (P0L00145201). 1 was continuing to assist to bring the civil and
      criminal lawyers together and ensure that the necessary external advice to
      consider the implications of Second Sight's interim report was obtained.
      Cartwright King replied stating that it would be "far better to advise once
      we have seen the entire report' (page 1 of P0L00145201). They stated
      that their "advice overall with regard to disclosure has not changed' and
      decisions regarding disclosure would need to be made on a "case-by-case
      basis" (page 1 of P0L00145201).


133. On 4 July 2013, Susan Crichton contacted Simon Baker to check the
      timeline of events regarding the `local suspense issue' (POL00029648).


134. I have been provided with a copy of an email chain which includes an email
      from Paula Vennells dated 6 July 2013 (POL00191252). In the email she
      asks Susan Crichton, "would we ever ask the lawyers to consider reviewing
      past prosecutions.. ." (page 3 of POL00191252). I was forwarded the chain
      by Susan Crichton on Sunday 7 July 2013 in which she was being asked
      for comments by Paula Vennells. I replied to Susan Crichton as soon as
      possible that morning, setting out my high-level thoughts to assist her
      response. In my response, I collated information we had obtained from
      Cartwright King. It is clear that at this point in time we were aware that
      Cartwright King was engaged and advising on the implications of the
      Second Sight Interim review, including whether or not it had implications
      for past convictions. I also discussed options regarding the Second Sight
      review, favouring retaining an independent reviewer (page 1 of
      P0L00191252).


135. On 7 July 2013, Paula Vennells emailed Mark Davies, Martin Edwards and
                                  Page 32 of 56

                                                                                  WITNO8620100




     Susan Crichton a draft statement regarding Horizon (P0L00115982). The
     Second Sight interim report was being published the following day.             I
      emailed Mark and Susan Crichton my comments on the draft, copied to
      Rodric Williams. I thought that the draft reference to "historic issues" was
      unhelpful as it may suggest that POL was worried about the safety of past
      convictions (page 2 of POL00115982). I wrote that this "may even give
      some people false hope" (which was not something I wanted to do) (page
      2 of POL00115982).       It appeared preferable for the wording to avoid
      incorrectly suggesting that this was a systemic issue; there was no
      suggestion of such an issue in Second Sight's report. I again indicated my
      view that the independence of Second Sight was important.


136. Second Sight's interim report was dated 8 July 2013 (P0L00099063). As
      anticipated from the correspondence preceding the report, the preliminary
      conclusion was that Second Sight had "so far found no evidence of system
      wide (systemic) problems with the Horizon software" (page 8 of
      POL00099063)_ The interim report noted the existence of the 14 branch
      and 64 branch bugs.


137. As can be seen from the correspondence prior to the Second Sight interim
     report being published, POL was considering the implications of the report
      and how to respond in advance. In particular, what came out of the interim
      report was consideration of the implications for civil and criminal cases and
      wider non-legal elements such as engagement with Lord Arbuthnot MP.


138. On 8 July 2013, Rodric Williams emailed Paula Vennells and Susan
      Crichton comments on the Second Sight interim report (POL00099107). I
      was copied into this email, but I do not recall that I had any involvement in
      commenting on the text of the Second Sight interim report.


139. On 9 July 2013, Lesley Sewell emailed Susan Crichton, setting out a list of
      how POL could manage activity going forward (POL00191593). I was
      copied into this email. I replied to Susan Crichton, suggesting a list of legal
                                           EL
                                                                                       WITN08620100
                                                                                  WITNO8620100




      issues for practical planning purposes. The content is too detailed for me
      to have prepared it solely based on my own knowledge. The focus is a
      response to the Second Sight report publication, split into criminal, civil,
      budget and strategy issues. Cartwright King must have advised regarding
      Gareth Jenkins' future involvement by this point in time, as point 6 in my
      response noted the need to instruct a new expert from Fujitsu and then
      move to a non-Fujitsu expert as fast as possible (page 1 of POL00191593).


140. I also noted in the email that the criminal case review, which was
      "underway by external lawyers [Cartwright King]" will focus on post-
      separation cases initially (page 1 of POL00191593). I expect that as these
      prosecutions were run by POL (rather than RMG), it would have been
      easier to collate the relevant paperwork. I state that the "recommendation
      is that all cases since 1 Jan 2010 be reviewed (to tie in to the migration
      from old to new Horizon)" (page 1 of POL00191593).             This was a
      recommendation by Cartwright King (page 2 of POL00191681).


141. On 10 July 2013, I emailed Susan Crichton (POL00191680) my comments
     on her draft board paper (POL00191681), but it is unclear from the face of
     the document, and I cannot recall, what they were.


142. I have been asked to comment on an email chain dated 10 and 11 July
     2013 (POL00323842), in which Rodric Williams seeks advice from
     Cartwright King regarding whether or not Helen Rose's report, which was
     said by Rodric Williams to be marked "confidential and legally privileged",
     was in fact legally privileged (page 4 of POL00323842).               Issues of
     disclosure in the context of a criminal case, and whether a document was
     subject to LPP which may have affected whether it needed to be disclosed,
     were not issues which I had any experience of and were issues which we
     expected the internal and external litigation lawyers to deal with.


143. As can be seen from the emails dated 28 June onwards, leading up to
     Cartwright King's advice dated 15 July 2013, POL was seeking and
                                  Page 34 of 56
                                                                                          WITN08620100
                                                                                    WITNO8620100




         implementing external legal advice to respond to Second Sight's interim
         report.




   144. I was away on a mostly unpaid sabbatical from 12 July to around 3
         September 2013.        During this period, I only intermittently checked my
         emails (as I had been told by Susan Crichton that I should have a proper
         break and avoid looking at them) and attachments were almost impossible
         to review on my mobile device.


   145. During this time, I believe that Piero D'Agostino (Lawyer, Financial
        Services) deputised for me (as he had previously done on other occasions,
         for example in a week in October 2012). However, it is unlikely that Piero
         D'Agostino would have been involved in Horizon-related matters, as they
         were already being dealt with by Susan Crichton, Rodric Williams and
         Jarnail Singh.


REVIEW OF PAST CRIMINAL CASES


   146. I was not responsible for overseeing the Cartwright King review of past
         criminal cases — that responsibility lay with Susan Crichton and
         subsequently Chris Aujard. I note too that I was on sabbatical for the initial
         period of this issue


   147. On Saturday 13 July 2013, Rodric Williams emailed Susan Crichton and
         others, with an overview of who was doing what following the Second Sight
         interim report (POL00297710).


   148. I was away and therefore not involved in these action points, but there is a
         reference which again indicates that Cartwright King had already provided
         advice regarding Gareth Jenkins by that point in time: "[Cartwright King]
         has raised [an] issue concerning Horizon evidence presented by Fujitsu
                                        Page 35 of 56
                                                                                   WITN08620100
                                                                               WITNO8620100




      during criminal trials". The email confirmed that Simon Clarke of Cartwright
      King's related advice note would be delivered by 15 July 2013. The email
      also confirmed that I emailed contact details for a potential new Horizon
      expert at Fujitsu to Cartwright King on 10 July 2013.


149. On 15 July 2013, Simon Clarke of Cartwright King issued his advice note
      regarding the use of Horizon system expert evidence in past and current
      criminal proceedings (P0L00006357). I was away on sabbatical at this
      point and do not remember receiving the advice note. Before the concerns
      leading up to this advice note, the POL view was that Gareth Jenkins was
      the leading Horizon expert who was relied on by POL in its prosecutions.
      Following advice from Cartwright King (between around 3 and 15 July
      2013), that impression changed, and POL became aware that there
      needed to be a replacement expert.      POL would ultimately have been
      guided by Cartwright King who had formed the view that Gareth Jenkins'
     "credibility as an expert witness [was] fatally undermined; he should not be
      asked to provide expert evidence in any current or future prosecution"
     (page 13 of POL00006357). Cartwright King's advice, followed by POL,
     was that a review should be undertaken (it was already underway)
      regarding making related disclosures to SPMs (page 14 of POL00006357).


150. On 17 July 2013, Martin Smith of Cartwright King emailed me, Susan
     Crichton, Rodric Williams and Jarnail Singh an advice note regarding
      Hitesh Hirani's case (POL00168975). This appears to have been one of
     the case-by-case reviews being undertaken by Cartwright King regarding
     disclosure. This was an email which, although also sent to Susan Crichton,
     and copied to Rodric Williams and Jarnail Singh, began "Hugh" and so, as
     it was always almost impossible to review attachments on my mobile
     device, I asked for clarification of what the attachment was to ensure that
     did not need to do anything further.


151. I have been provided with a copy of an advice note prepared by Simon
     Clarke of Cartwright King, dated 2 August 2013, regarding the duty to
                                                                                      WITN08620100
                                                                                 WITNO8620100




        record and retain material (POL00006799). Whilst I cannot recall seeing
        it, I was on sabbatical at this time and expect that this advice note would
        have been dealt with by Susan Crichton or Jarnail Singh.


  152. I have been provided with a copy of an advice note prepared by Cartwright
       King, `Observations and analysis of the Cartwright King prosecution review
        process', dated 5 December 2013 (POL00198595). I cannot remember
        seeing this review note previously, although it was emailed to Chris Aujard
        and me on 6 December 2013 (POL00198594). I believe that Chris Aujard
        would have dealt with this advice note as he took over all Horizon matters
        after joining POL Legal (see paragraph 39 above). The advice note states
        that over 300 cases had been reviewed in depth and demonstrated that
        POL followed the advice to complete the review and disclosure exercise
        (page 13 of P0L00198595). I cannot recall having had any involvement in
        or knowledge of the disclosure issues discussed at paragraphs 24 — 27
        (pages 8 and 9 of P0L00198595), other than when I saw the emails
        discussing the Cartwright King prosecution review on 20 February 2014
        and promptly alerted Chris Aujard (POL00201067).


  153. I have been provided with a copy of Cartwright King's advice regarding R
       v Hosi, dated I May 2014 (POL00133638). As I explain below, I had left
         POL by this point in time.


BRIAN ALTMAN QC


   154. At some stage, a decision was made to obtain additional independent
        advice from external leading counsel regarding POL's future strategy,
         including the Cartwright King case review.


   155. On 22 July 2013, Gavin Matthews of Bond Dickinson emailed Susan
        Crichton, Jarnail Singh, Rodric Williams, Simon Richardson and me,
         copied to Andy Parsons of Bond Dickinson, regarding a list of general
         issues to discuss with Brian Altman QC (as he then was) (POL00297884).
                                      Page 37 of 56
                                                                                      WITNO8620100
                                                                                    WITNO8620100




156. On 22 July 2013, 1 replied to Gavin Matthews' email, copying Susan
      Crichton, providing a list which I had previously drafted to try to assist. I
      was aware that Brian Altman QC was being instructed but I was not
      otherwise involved in his instruction. It is unlikely that I joined the telephone
      call with Brian Altman QC on Wednesday 24 July 2013, referred to in Gavin
      Matthews' email and I have no recollection of doing so.


157. I have been provided with a copy of Brian Altman QC's observations on
      the terms of reference for his appointment, dated 2 August 2013
      (POL00021981) as well as an undated terms of reference prepared by
      Bond Dickinson (POL00021982). I was on sabbatical when the terms of
      reference were prepared and discussed.


158. Brian Altman QC notes on page 3, footnote 4, that POL needs to determine
      whether he is advising on the "efficacy' of prosecutions or the "safety' of
      convictions (page 3 of POL00021981). I was not involved in the decision-
      making process around this question.          It is also apparent that Bond
      Dickinson subsequently advised POL on 9 August 2013 that Brian Altman
      QC's remit should not extend to the safety of convictions (POL00021980)_


159. I have been provided with a copy of Brian Altman QC's 'Interim Review of
      Cartwright King's Current [Case Review] Process', dated 2 August 2013
      (POL00006583). I was on sabbatical when this advice note was prepared
      and received. In preparing this statement, I can see that at paragraph 15,
      Brian Altman QC stated that ". . .the approach of [Cartwright King] and
      counsel appears to be fundamentally sound. . .", but queried a cut-off date
     of three years for the review (page 6 of POL00006583).


160. I have been provided with a note prepared by Bond Dickinson of a
     conference with Brian Altman QC on 9 September 2013 (POL00006485)
     and a further note of the same conference by an unknown author
     (POL00139866). The conference was attended by Susan Crichton, Jarnail
                                                                                     WITNO8620100
                                                                               WITNO8620100




      Singh and Rodric Williams, as well as attendees from Cartwright King and
      Bond Dickinson. I did not attend the conference. I received a copy of Bond
      Dickinson's note of the conference by email a few weeks later on 25
      September 2013 (POL00168919). I recall that shortly after I returned from
      sabbatical Susan Crichton told me that she was leaving POL, and in that
      context stated that Rodric Williams would progress the Brian Altman QC
      workstream.


161. I have been provided with an advice note prepared by Brian Altman QC
      ('General Review'), dated 15 October 2013 (P0L00006581). I do not recall
      reviewing this advice and believe that Chris Aujard would have dealt with
      it (with help from Rodric Williams if needed). The advice follows the 9
      September conference, which I did not attend.


162. I can see that the advice note confirmed Brian Altman QC's advice that 1
      January 2010 was a "logical, proportionate and practicable" cut-off date for
      Cartwright King's case review (page 5 of P0L00006581). I do not recall
      having any involvement in the setting of the cut-off date for the Cartwright
      King case review. As above, I considered that the review was taking place
      and being progressed appropriately by others, following advice from
      Cartwright King and Brian Altman QC. In paragraph 72 of Brian Altman
      QC's advice note, he referred to a telephone conference which he attended
      on 4 October 2013 with representatives of POL (I was not present), Bond
      Dickinson and Cartwright King. I am now aware that he stated that "it was
      agreed by all that the 1st January 2010 start date for the [Cartwright King]
      review was logical and proportionate, and there should be no change to if'
      (page 27 of POL00006581). Paragraph 3, point 2, of Brian Altman QC's
      subsequent advice note dated 21 October 2013, confirms that Rodric
      Williams and Jarnail Singh of POL, Martin Smith and Simon Clarke of
      Cartwright King and Gavin Matthews of Bond Dickinson attended this
      meeting (page 2 of POL00038592).


163. At paragraph 130, Brian Altman QC advised that the Falkirk issue was "an
                                   Page 39 of 56
                                                                                   WITN08620100
                                                                              WITNO8620100




      isolated instance" with no relevance to Cartwright King's review (page 42
      of POL00006581)_ As above, I do not recall reading this advice and it was
      being dealt with by others.


164. At paragraph 148, Brian Altman QC advised that Gareth Jenkins was
      ". . . tainted and his future role as an expert is untenable" (page 47 of




165. 1 can see that at paragraph 162, Brian Altman QC stated that, "[Cartwright
      King] has also tended to advise on its likely stance to any application for
      permission to appeal, or to any substantive appeal, should permission to
      appeal be granted.     That amounts to consideration of the safety of the
      conviction" (page 51 of POL00006581). Please also see the email from
      Bond Dickinson dated 9 August (P0L00021980) regarding Brian Altman
      QC's earlier comments relating to the distinction between reviewing
      efficacy and safety.




      convicted individuals to participate in a mediation process (page 52 of
      P0L00006581). As above, I do not recall reading this at the time, and it
      was being progressed by others.


167. I have been provided with an advice note prepared by Brian Altman QC,
      `Review of POL prosecution role', dated 21 October 2013 (POL00038592).
      It is not clear that this document ever came to me (I was away this week).
     As above (see paragraph 39), it would have been part of the range of items
     that Chris Aujard said that he was taking on.
                                                                                      WITNO8620100
                                                                                  WITNO8620100




     — this would explain why it is derived from the RMG policy.            As also
     mentioned above at paragraph 101, by March 2013 the policy was being
     revised (see POL00122166 on 5 March 2013). It appears that the 14 and
     64 branch issues then arose and by August 2013 Cartwright King had
     started advising on amending the policy. Brian Altman QC then became
     involved and advised on these matters in October 2013.


169. I have been asked regarding my understanding of Brian Altman QC's
     comment that "The Horizon data integrity issue was an exceptional
     instance of [POL] prosecutorial failure of serial non-disclosure in breach of
     [POL's] disclosure obligations" and conclusion that there was no need for
      POL to divest its role as a prosecutor (page 4, paragraph 4 iii), of
      POL00038592). As above, I do not recall seeing this advice note at the
     time, but it appears that this paragraph needs to be read in conjunction with
      paragraphs 96 and 97, where Brian Altman QC explains that the "recent
      events have to be seen in their proper context' and that the "serial non-
      disclosure of relevant material occurred in circumstances in which POL and
      its advisors were wholly unaware that there might be disclosable material
      or information..." (page 34 of POL00038592).          Brian Altman QC also
      concluded that he had seen "no evidence to suggest that [POL] exercises
      its investigation and prosecution function in anything other than a well-
      organised, structured and efficient manner, through an expert and
      dedicated team of in-house investigators and lawyers, supported by
      [Cartwright King] and [Cartwright King's] in-house counsel, as well as
      external counsel and agents where required".


170. I have been asked my views on the conclusion that there was no need for
      POL to divest its role as a prosecutor. As far as I can recall, I was generally
      aware that POL was considering its position and taking advice from its
      external advisors on this point.


171. 1 have also been provided with a copy of an updated version of Brian
      Altman QC's 'Review of POL prosecution role' advice note, dated 19

            to review this by Chris Aujard.


t


    172. 1 had no experience or understanding of the Criminal Cases Review
           Commission ("CCRC") prior to joining RMG / POL. I have been provided
           with a number of documents relating to the CCRC:


            i.   the CCRC's letter dated 12 July 2013, which was received by POL on
                 15 July 2013(P0L00039994).
           ii.   an undated one-page advice note on the CCRC and a suggested
                 response to the CCRC (POL00039993).
          iii.   the 'draft paragraphs for insertion into CCRC reply' document
                 (POL00039995).
          iv.    Susan Crichton's email dated 16 July 2013 to Andy Parsons at Bond
                 Dickinson, regarding the letter dated 15 July 2013 from the CCRC
                 (POL00039996).
          v.     Susan Crichton's holding response to the CCRC, dated 24 July 2013
                 (page 5 of POL00040813).
         vi.     POL's draft response to the CCRC dated 26 July 2013, referring to the
                 instruction of Brian Altman QC and the Cartwright King case review
                 (page 4 of POL00040813).
         vii.    the CCRC's letter to Susan Crichton, dated 30 July 2013(page 3 of
                 POL00040813).


    173. As above, I was on sabbatical from 12 July 2013 until around 3 September
          2013.     Although I was aware that the CCRC had made contact
          (POL00297884), I do not recall seeing any of these documents at the time
          and I cannot recall having any role in preparing the response.


    174. I have also been provided with a copy of Chris Aujard's letter to the CCRC,
          dated 5 June 2014 (POL00124350). As below, I had left POL by this point
                                        Page 42 of 56
                                                                                      WITNO8620100
                                                                                 WITNO8620100




      in time.




175. Following the receipt of advice from Cartwright King, including Simon
      Clarke's advice note dated 15 July 2013, POL gave consideration to
      instructing an alternative expert witness for criminal and civil cases. I can
      see from his advice notes that this issue was also discussed with Brian
      Altman QC (page 2 of POL00006485 and page 47 of P0L00006581).


176. I was not involved in the decision to appoint a new expert, although I
      occasionally assisted in the search.


177. I have been asked if I briefed members of the board on the issues raised
      in relation to Gareth Jenkins. I cannot recall ever having briefed the board
      on this issue.


178. On 1 October 2013, Jarnail Singh emailed me a CV from Professors
      Kramer and Dulay of Imperial College London (POL00146545).                He
      subsequently sent the CV to Alwen Lyons, asking who would be able to
      sign off their instruction. Alwen suggested that Lesley Sewell and I could
      sign the instruction off. She said that I could "say whether their background
      will be creditable in court". This issue was outside of my experience, and
      I replied stating, "I wouldn't know but I can ask [Cartwright King] or the new
      GC [Chris Aujard] what they think".          Rodric Williams subsequently
      confirmed that a next step had already been agreed.


179. Whilst I was away (from Thursday 17 October 2013 to Monday 28 October
      2013), on 22 October 2013, Jarnail Singh emailed Alwen Lyons
      (P0L00146675) attaching a draft paper for approval of the new Horizon
      expert (P0L00146676). I do not recall having any involvement with the
      preparation of this paper, this appears to be an early draft of the paper
      discussed below at paragraph 181.
                                   Page 43 of 56
                                                                                  WITN08620100
                                                                                WITNO8620100




      November 2013 (POL00300593). During this chain, it is clear that Rodric
      Williams is progressing the process of appointing a new expert and Jarnail
      Singh is ascertaining details regarding costs, with ultimate sign off resting
      with Chris Aujard.


181. On 19 January 2014, Jarnail Singh emailed Larissa Wilson and others
      (POL00147247), attaching an updated Executive Committee paper by
      Chris Aujard, dated 17 January 2014 (POL00147248) seeking budgetary
      approval for a new Horizon expert.      I do not have any recollection of
      assisting with this Executive Committee paper. By this point in time, I note
      that Brian Altman QC had agreed with the advice of Cartwright King to
      appoint a new expert.




182. I do not recall being involved in the creation or running of the mediation
      scheme.


183. I have been provided with a copy of an email chain primarily between
      Jarnail Singh and Bond Dickinson, regarding the overlap between the
      mediation scheme and criminal prosecutions, dated 21 to 26 January 2014
      (POL00325795). There is reference to a meeting on 28 January 2014. 1
      cannot recall whether or not I attended this meeting.
                                                                                     WITNO8620100
                                                                                WITNO8620100




      (P0L00300567) regarding the decision maker described in the draft
      revised prosecution policy. I left for annual leave the following day, and
      Jarnail Singh then chased a response when I returned on Monday 28
      October 2013.      I asked Jarnail Singh what Brian Altman QC had
      recommended and Jarnail Singh confirmed Cartwright King's advice (page
      1 of P0L00300567). I recall that at this point, all such issues were being
      directed to Chris Aujard.


185. A draft prosecution policy appears to have been prepared by Simon Clarke
      of Cartwright King in November 2013 (POL00123144), but I do not recall
      seeing it.


186. On     21     January   2014,    Rodric   Williams   emailed   Chris   Aujard
      (POL00123142) in relation to Project Sparrow.           I cannot recall the
      background or scope of Project Sparrow. The email attached a draft board
      paper (POL00123143) on future prosecutions and its appendices
      (POL00123144). I understand that the board paper was prepared by Chris
      Aujard for the directors of POL. It appears that I had some involvement,
      although various issues would have been outside of my knowledge and I
      do not recall my precise contribution. I cannot remember any discussions
      with Chris Aujard about the draft board paper.


187. I have been asked why Brian Altman QC's comments regarding disclosure
      failings were not incorporated into the paper. As above, I was not involved
      in progressing Brian Altman QC's advice and do not recall my precise
      contribution to the note.


188. The working draft paper set out various options for dealing with future
      criminal conduct and pros and cons of the options were described in
      Appendix F (page 20 of POL00123144).           I do not recall who drafted
      Appendix F.

                                                                                      WITNO8620100




    189. By the end of 2012, the POL Legal team had grown to around a dozen
             lawyers and I was seeking to split my role up into two or three parallel
             teams, which I discussed on and off with Susan Crichton during 2013. I
             was expecting to resolve this when I returned from sabbatical, but between
             Susan Crichton's leaving and Chris Aujard's arrival this was never
             progressed in the run up to Christmas 2013. Consequently, I decided to
             hand in my notice at the start of January 2014.


    190. After leaving POL on 20 March 2014, I joined TSB in May 2014 as Head of
             Legal of a Commercial team. I left that role in July 2018. I then decided to
             work short fixed term contacts, working as a lawyer at the London Legacy
             Development Corporation (March 2019 until October 2019), Burberry
             (November 2019 until December 2020) and BSI (April 2022 until October
             2022).


IC]1I   fl


    191. I have been asked to reflect on my time at POL and consider if there is
             anything which could have been handled differently with the benefit of
             hindsight.


    192. I have been specifically asked about how POL handled challenges to the
             integrity of the Horizon IT system, the approach to prosecutions and the
             disclosure of information to SPMs convicted on the basis of Horizon data.


    193. In relation to challenges to the Horizon IT System and the approach to
             prosecutions, pre-separation, RMG's Civil Litigation Team and Criminal
             Law Team were responsible for progressing criminal and civil cases.


    194. Post-separation, we were dependent on the advice of the internal lawyer
             subject matter experts, external lawyers and external counsel in relation to
                                                                                           WITNO8620100
                                                                                     WITN08620100




           these issues and the disclosure of information to SPMs.         My primary
           involvement as Head of Legal was principally in relation to the response to
           the emerging issue of the 14 branch and 64 branch bugs becoming
           apparent to POL Legal in June 2013, which had resulted from the
           instruction of Second Sight in 2012, that instruction being despite risks
           being raised regarding `floodgates' by POL's external advisors prior to their
           instruction. I always understood that POL was acting appropriately and in
           good faith as it responded, in line with the advice that had been obtained.


    195. Given all of the above, and with hindsight, it would have been desirable at
           times to have had more resources in the POL Legal team, for example a
           second criminal lawyer (but there were issues with HR headcount
           limitations) and/or more than one external law firm advising. Doing so
           would have provided a wider variety of views.
