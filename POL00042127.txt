Lucy,

lam afraid, we didn’t make any further progress on this and I know the deadline was yesterday. Whilst the Royal Mail
archive personnel initially seemed willing to assist us, they have yesterday referred it to their legal tearn, who were
reluctant to release any documents to us. They were going to speak to Rod Williams to understand why we need this,
but I don’t know if such a conversation happened.

My view is still (as per the attached e-mail) that given that the external auditors have not re-reported any concerns over
the Credence IT control environment, this could be interpreted that the shortcomings noted in 2010 have been
remediated.

Best regards,
Johann

Hi Johann,

I will need to produce a draft statement and have it reviewed by counsel so Thursday 8 November is the absolute
deadline. If you could let have your comments so far that would be helpful.

Kind regards,

Lucy

Hi Lucy

We still haven’t found any relevant documents. When is the absolute deadline for this? Would you like me in the
meantime summarise my conclusion on the subsequent papers that we have reviewed?

Best regards,

MG ARC Minutes

Dear Michelle,

As discussed yesterday, we are looking for Royal Mail Group Audit Committee or Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee
(ARC) minutes for meetings that took place during 2010 & 2011. it appears the Post Office Limited Audit, Risk &
Compliance Committee was not formed until 2012 so we believe the relevant information must be in the Royal Mail

Group meeting minutes.

Within these minutes the relevant search terms will be:
* Credence
e Credence IT Controls
@ Credence change controls

Hi Michelle,
Ah, maybe I was given the wrong number.

Thank you for agreeing to look into this. I am sorry to be a pain but it is very urgent (it relates to ongoing
litigation which is currently before the High Court ~ you might have seen it in the news). Are you able to
look into it sooner or ask someone who might be able to do this sooner in your team? Again I apologise
for the late notice - we are working to strict deadlines set as part of the trial process and we have been
struggling to track down these documents as we believed they were at the Postal Museum, but it
appears not.

Thank you in advance.
Best wishes,

Rebecca

Dear Michelle,

Further to my voicemail, I work at Post Office Limited and we are looking to access the
minutes from the Royal Mail Group Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee meetings from
before the split, namely 2010 & 2011. I was given your details by Jamie Ellul from the
Postal Museum who advised you might be able to help.

Are you able to send me these documents?

Many thanks,

Rebecca
