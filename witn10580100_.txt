                     POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




              FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF KEVIN SHIELS




1. I am a Senior Public Prosecutor in the Western & Southern Region of the

   Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland (hereafter'PPSNI').


2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

   (the "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 8th

   issues that I was involved in.


6. At the outset I wish to offer my sincere apologies to Mrs McKelvey for my

   part in the prosecution of her on foot of the allegations raised by Post Office

   Limited,




7. I first became involved in this case on 19th February 2004 when it was

   allocated to me with the task of taking a prosecution decision. I had no

   Detective Superintendent P McAuley stating that there was sufficient

   evidence for a prosecution [PNI00000001_082].The file contained a further

   report prepared by Suzanne Winter, Investigations Manager with Post Office

   Limited detailing that "the discrepancies summarised on the pension

   schedule indicate it is due to deliberate action and not error and McKelvey is

   (ii)      prosecution is required in the public interest — the Public Interest Test.


10. Having considered the evidence on the file, I decided that the Test for

   Prosecution was met in relation to the offence of theft and issued a direction

   to Case Preparation late February 2004 to prepare papers in anticipation of

   trial.

   2004 when the defence conceded a prima facie case and the matter was

   returned for trial to Omagh Crown Court. Primary disclosure was handed to

   defence solicitors at committal on 20th April 2004 as is normal practice

   [PNI00000001 081].

13,The primary disclosure would have included the Non-Sensitive Disclosure

   Schedule which to my recollection was provided by Police

   [PNI00000001 080}. I would also have been in receipt of the Sensitive

   Schedule [PNI00000001_044] which was a nil return. My understanding at

   the time was Detective Constable Coyle was the Disclosure Officer.


14. There was nothing in the Non-Sensitive Disclosure Schedule or the Sensitive

   Disclosure Schedule which alerted me to any issue with the Horizon IT

   system, If any such material existed and was brought to my attention I would

   have disclosed it as primary disclosure. I would also have reviewed whether

   the Test for Prosecution remained met.


15. Mrs McKelvey was arraigned and pleaded not guilty on the 1716 May 2004

   when a trial date of the 13 `September 2004 was fixed for hearing of the

   matter.


16. The case was listed for mention on the 241" June 2004 when the trial judge

   requested defence to inform the court of any disclosure issues by the

   following Monday (28th June 2004). The case was not re-listed prior to trial.


17. An important part of the Directing Officer's role is to discharge the disclosure

   duties placed on the DPP .f PPS. Those obligations are set out at paragraphs

   4,54 -- 4.59 of the PPS Code for Prosecutors. By virtue of section 7A of the

   Criminal Procedure and Investigation Act 1996 (as amended) disclosure

   duties are continuing and are kept under review by the Directing Officer

   throughout a prosecution,

                                                                                     W ITN 10580100




18. A Defence Statement was received by PPSNI on 10th May 2004, At

   paragraph 4 it cited four possible causes of the branch shortfalls identified ,

   (i)      Human error;

   (ii)     Pressure of running the shop;

   (iii)    Operating a credit account through the Post Office;

   (iv)     Failure of the Post Office to provide a sufficient cash float.

19. Regardless of the contents of the Defence Statement, had any matter been

   drawn to my attention suggesting that there was a question mark over the

   reliability of the Horizon IT system this would have been disclosed as primary

   disclosure as it would clearly have undermined the prosecution case.


20,A letter was sent to the PSN! Investigating Officer D/Con Coyle enclosing a

   copy of the defence case statement by a Crown Court clerk. I have a copy of

   the original letter which is signed on my behalf by the clerk. He was asked to

   review the unused material on the schedule and any other material in his

   possession and let me know whether there was anything that may meet the

   test for disclosure [PNI00000001_076].


21. 1 have reviewed a letter from D/Con Coyle to a D/inspector in Omagh dated

   21 t May 2004 in which he responds to this correspondence and the defence

   case statement [PNI00000001_078].


22.1 sent a letter to the defence solicitors dated 15th June 2004 in reference to

   the defence case statement received enclosing a schedule of unused

   material and six further specified documents as per my on-going duty of

   disclosure [PNI00000001 037].

                                                                                  W ITN 10580100




23. Having completed secondary disclosure I had no further involvement in this

   case until I was requested to review the prosecution on public interest

   grounds due to the ill-health of Mrs. McKelvey on the 10th September 2004

   [PNI00000001_038].


24. In this particular region the DPP office was situated in Omagh Courthouse

   and was staffed at that time by two Senior Public Prosecutors who would

   have dealt with disclosure and other issues that would have arisen during the

   lifetime of any case in the Crown Court.


25.A letter [PNI00000001_071] dated 22nd July 2004 was sent by defence

   solicitors directly to D/Con Coyle requesting four specified items of

   secondary disclosure to assist Forensic Accountants Goldblatt McGuigan

   instructed on behalf of Mrs McKelvey.


26. My late colleague Brian Curran, a Senior Public Prosecutor then based at

   Omagh Courthouse, wrote to the defence solicitors by letter dated 27th July

   2004 indicating that their letter to D/Con Coyle had been passed to him for

   reply. He advised the defence solicitors that the PSNI Investigating Officer

   would liaise with the Post Office Investigator Suzanne Winters and a

   response would issue in due course [PN100000001_079].


27.Within the materials provided to me by the Inquiry is a letter from Ms Winters

   to D/Con Coyle dated 30th July 2004 responding to points 2 and 3 of the

   secondary disclosure requests. I had not seen this document before

   compiling this statement [PNI00000001_069].

28. D/inspector McCleery wrote to DPP in a letter dated 16th August 2004

   enclosing the letter from defence solicitors dated 22nd July 2004 along with a

   note from D/Con Coyle in which he responds to points 1-3. I understand that

   point 4, a request for interview tapes, was dealt with separately. Also

   enclosed is the material in response to the request for further disclosure

   [PN100000001 _71 ].


29. On 23rd August 2004 my colleague Paul Dale, a Senior Public Prosecutor

   then based at Omagh Courthouse, wrote to the defence solicitors responding

   to their requests for further disclosure contained in their letter of 22nd July

   2004 [PNI000000014070].


30. Paul Dale provided the information to defence that had been supplied to him

   from Post Office via Police. Having viewed Paul Dale's letter of the 23rd

   August 2004, I note that he indicates that he was informed that further

   material had been requested and any documents received would have been

   reviewed for disclosure. I have no independent recollection of whether any

   further material was received and/or reviewed.


31. A letter was sent by the defence solicitor to DPP staff based at Omagh

   Courthouse enclosing correspondence from Goldblatt McGuigan to the Post

   Office Investigator Suzanne Winters dated 28th July 2004. The letter asks Ms

   Winters to provide the Forensic Accountants with nine itemized pieces of

   information. Item six is a request to Ms Winters for information on the

   Horizon computer system procedures for inputting cash received from Royal

   Mail.

32. Also enclosed is a 'note of discussions with Suzanne Winters and Rosemary

   Curran of Post Office regarding accounting systems at Post Office counters.

   Held 23rd June 2004. Updated following discussions with Suzanne Winters

   on 1 July 2004.' Further material is enclosed with Appendix A and B to the

   note. The letter dated 28th July 2004 was sent to DPP for information

   purposes only.


33.All of this correspondence was forwarded by a DPP clerk to prosecution

   counsel Philip Mateer BL. He was asked to forward it to Charles McKay BL if

   the brief was to be passed to him [PN100000001 072].


34 On 7th September 2004 the defence solicitors wrote to DPP staff based at

   Omagh Courthouse asking the DPP to consider whether the public interest

   limb of the test for prosecution was still met in light of an enclosed medical

   report on Mrs McKelvey. Within the Inquiry materials is a handwritten note

   from a DPP clerk passing the correspondence to me for urgent reply.


35. There is a handwritten file note created by me dated 10th September 2004 in

   respect of a telephone call to Mrs McKelvey's solicitor Stephen Atherton in

   which I expressed sympathy for his client's health problems but concluded

   that there was nothing in the report that would influence me to alter my

   original decision to prosecute.


36.The trial in this matter was listed to commence on the 13th September 2004

   when a jury was empanelled. The trial ran for 3 days until the 16th September

   2004 when the           returned a not guilty verdict. During the currency of the
                    jury




   trial I am not aware if any issues whether disclosure or otherwise were

     brought to my attention. Such issues, if any, would normally have been dead

     with by those prosecutors situated in the DPP office in Omagh Courthouse,


  37. Almost twenty years after this prosecution I do not now recall the specifics of

     the case. I do not recall anything being brought to my attention by the Post

     Office to suggest that they were aware of systematic deficiencies in the

     Horizon IT platform that could produce unexplained shortfalls. If any such

     matter was brought to my attention I would have viewed it as disctosable and

     taken the appropriate steps._


  38. There are no other matters of relevance to Phase 4 of the Inquiry that I wish

     to draw to the attention of the Chair,


Statement of Truth


I believe the content of this statement to be true.
