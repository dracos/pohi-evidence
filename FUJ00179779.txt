Yes KELs can get deleted.
I will see if I can dig out the deleted KEL details, or would you prefer that it is just stay as ‘deleted’.

John,

Thanks for this. It looks like JSimpkins338Q no longer exists, it wasn’t in the set that we sent them. Do KELs get
deleted?

Hi Matthew,

I have spent some time trying to track this down via the branch name, date range, release, problem description etc..
However I have yet to find a matching KEL.

I think that the best fitting Peak is PCO126042 which is for branch 160868 (Cow Wynd) but the branch is in Falkirk.
PC0126376 has a good description of the problem, which is in the Escher product, fixed in the new version at $90.

This KEL JSimpkins338Q appears to apply which should have been in the extract supplied to them.

Regards
John

John,
1! am being asked if we can confirm if there is / was a KEL for the “Callendar Square” issue. Are you able to confirm
that definitively please?

Please see the attachment which describes it (points 1 — 4); it seems that it was a known issue that was fixed in $90,
and that in this context was of interest because it was brought up in connection with the West Byfleet case.

If it was fixed, and therefore the bug wouldn’t arise again, would a KEL, had it existed, have been deleted?

Thanks

Jonathan Gribben [

Thanks Matthew.

I've had a look at the information and there is reference in Gareth Jenkins witness statement to an email in appendix c
of Charles McLachlan's report. I've gone through the report but cannot see it included — are you able to send me a
copy of all of appendix c? Gareth also refers to a previous witness statement on 8 February 2010 — do you have a
copy of this?

Also, the report itself contains track changes — do you have a final copy?
Kind regards,

Lucy

Lucy,
The attached email I sent to you in July included the zip file that was originally provided to Second Sight, and which
includes information relating to the Calendar Square case.

I don’t believe there is a related KEL, but I will check for other information.

Matthew, Pete,

You may recall a while ago that I asked you to provide information on Calendar Square, Falkirk. Apologies if I have
missed your response, however I think this request may still be outstanding. Please could you provide me with any
information you have on this. Could you also confirm whether KELs exist for this bug?

Kind regards,
Lucy
