Paula,

Dear Moya, Thank you for your
support and for finding the time to
text (never underestimate the
difference it makes).

Yes it’s tough; but now is the right
time to act. And as regards the

Inquiry, you are right - that's exactly
what I plan to do.

I hope you are well? I wish you a
rewarding, healthy and happy
2024!

Warmest wishes,

Paula
