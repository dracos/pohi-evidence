Please find attached a draft note on the D&O risks for your review and comments.
Have you had a chance to speak to Mark about how sensitive this issue might be if it became public?

Once we've got Mark's view, we can then take a decision about whether to send the note to AIG or just show it to them
in a meeting.

Kind regards
Andy
