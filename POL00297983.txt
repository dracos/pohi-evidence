[TO BE TYPED ON POST OFFICE LIMITED HEADED PAPER]

Dear Mrs Berlin
Horizon Computer System

I refer to my letter of 24 July 2013 in which I indicated that I hoped to be in a position to
provide you with a more detailed response by today. Whilst I am not yet in a position to
notify you of all the details you requested in your letter dated 12 July I do set out below our
proposed course of action in this matter.

POL accepts that a number of criminal convictions may be impacted by the matters
highlighted in the Second Sight Interim report and it has taken early and determined steps to
identify those cases where such an impact may fall.

To that end POL has decided to instruct Brian Altman QC, former First Treasury Counsel
with substantial prosecuting experience whose remit it is intended should be, in broad terms,
to review and advise POL on its strategy and process for reviewing past/current prosecutions
given the findings of the Second Sight interim report. Moreover, we intend asking counsel to
report to the Post Office Board in due course with his findings.

POL has also instructed an external firm of criminal specialist solicitors to identify every
criminal case prosecuted by POL and the Royal Mail Group (prior to their separation on 1
April 2012), and in any event in the last three years, so as to determine the safety of the
convictions. Once such a case is identified, counsel will also be asked to review the case
fully so as to determine the proper approach to be taken.

We hope that the content of this letter and the kind of processes and review we intend
initiating allays your concerns and those of the Attorney General. We take the view that it is
incumbent upon POL as a major public institution to take every reasonable step to ensure
that those whose convictions may be regarded as unsafe are given justice.

Yours sincerely

Susan Crichton
General Counsel
