SUMMARY OF FACTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 21.3(1)(b)
OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE RULES 2005

ROYAL MAIL GROUP LIMITED v JULIAN WILSON

The Defendant is 59 years of age! jand was a Subpostmaster for
5 years and 10 months at Astwood Bank Post Office prior to his suspension from duty on the

11" September 2008.

Enquiries commenced when on the 11" September 2008 Post Office Limited Auditors
attended Astwood Bank Post Office where they introduced themselves to the Postmaster
Julian Wilson and explained that they were to conduct an audit on behalf of Post Office
Limited. The Postmaster allowed them access to the secure area and immediately informed
them that there would be a shortage in the cash of around £27,000. He explained to them
that it was due to an accumulation of shortages he had experienced at the Post Office over
the last 5 years or so. He explained that he had been inflating the cash on hand figures to
show that the office accounts would balance weekly and more recently on the monthly

Trading Period.

On completion of the audit the audit shortage of £27,811.98 was discovered by the Post
Office Limited Auditors. .

As a result Post Office Limited Auditors contacted Post Office Limited Investigation Officers.
Subsequently Post Office Limited Investigators attended the Subpostmasters home address

where he consented to searches where various items were seized.

He was then interviewed on tape under caution at his Solicitors Office in the presence of his
legal representative. During interview Mr Wilson admitted to false accounting over a period of
5 years due to losses he had been experiencing. He denied that he had used any of the
money to credit his bank account or pay his mortgage or to pay suppliers. He was then
shown various Trading Accounts available to the Officers from the 11'" April 2007 to the
20" August 2008 and he confirmed that they all showed false cash figures. Mr Wilson
explained how this had been common practice for the past 5 years or so. He was asked if he
had considered theft by his employees given the fact it appeared the shortages were a
regular occurrence with no explanation or corresponding errors as are appearing at current.

He said he had not believed this to be the case.

Mr Wilson admitted to a period of offending over 5 years between September 2003 and
September 2008.

The total loss to Post Office Limited is £27,811.98.
