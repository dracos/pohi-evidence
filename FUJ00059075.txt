Symptoms

Critical event on counter: <br>"An unexpected error occurred while attempting to modify an entry in the run map. Timeout occurred waiting for
I lock (0xC1090003)"<br> <br>This single event occurred just after midnight during LFSEndOfDay processing. <br> <br>Sometimes a storm of
these events occurs - see KEL KEL <a href="http://SSCWEBSERVO1/SSC/SSC_KEL/kel_view_kel.jsp?
I KELRef=JBallantyne5245k.htm">JBallantyne5245k</a>

Problem

Possibly caused by an outstanding lock on the run table, which is cleared subsequently when ClearDesk runs. <br>The problem is known to
have affected at least 129 counters. <br><br>KEL <a href="http://SSCWEBSERV01/SSC/SSC_KEL/kel_view_kel jsp?
KELRef=JBallantyne5245k">JBallantyne5245k</a> </kel> documents the same event where there were multiple occurrences of the error, and
errors in deciarations.<br><br>The event storms probably have the same underlying cause as the events documented in <kel><a
href="http://SSCWEBSERVO1/SSC/SSC_KEL/kel_view_kel.jsp?KELRef=JSimpkins338Q' > JSimpkins338Q</a>.<br><br>PC0086212 is with
development for problems balancing while these events are occurring.

Solution - Helpdesk

A single event can be ignored.

Evidence

Do not pass further instances to SSC unless there appear to be side effects.
