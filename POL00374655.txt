Hi Kevin

Please find attached the Steering Group up-date pack for the Branch Support Programme. If you feel based on the
content that the meeting does not need to go ahead then I will send a cancellation notice. I will still be in London
anyway so if you want me to walk you through it on a face to face basis then I will be available.

Thanks

Gayle
