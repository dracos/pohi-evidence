Dear Sue,

BROKEN AUDIT TRAIL

We have, in the course of attempting data retrievals for Charles Leighton, and subsequently
for a PON reconciliation query, become aware that the audit trail is incomplete for the
period 8%.— 14% August 2000.

This break has arisen due to a combination of events outside our immediate control but it
does mean that we are not able to retrieve TMS records for that 6 day period. All other
elements of the audit trail are complete.

Ican assure you that the audit solution was working correctly during that period and that the
data was written to both the Wigan and Bootle tapes as expected. We have suffered from
coincidental DLT failure at both sites compounded by the loss of the Wigan DLT by TNT
Couriers who were bringing a tape to Feltham where we were going to attempt low level
data recovery.

The Bootle DLT has been investigated by Vogon, specialists in data recovery, who have
confirmed that they could recover some, but not all, of the data on the tape. This is no more
than we can do ourselves.

There is nothing we can do to recover the missing records nor:is there anything extra that we
can do to ensure that this unusual set of circumstances does not happen again.

Yours sincerely,

Jan Holmes ICL Pathway
