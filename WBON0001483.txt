Andy, Rodric

Please find attached a draft letter to RMG. Email for Rod to send below.

"Dear Luke

Further to our previous discussion about Royal Mail providing copies of the pre-2011 audit reports of Horizon produced
by Ernst and Young, a request for these documents has been made in Court by the Claimants. It would be
appreciated if you could reconsider Royal Mail's position that it would not be willing to provide copies of these

documents without a Court Order compelling disclosure.

As I am sure you are aware, the trial into Horizon is currently being heard. Please could you therefore respond to this

email as a matter of urgency."

Many thanks

Amy
