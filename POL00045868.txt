Summary of my Findings and Conclusions

| set out my findings under the following headings:

(a) The profit level to POL;

(b) Evidence of Mr Stacey about a payment of £241,194.62 to FRTS;

(c) Auditing methods used by Royal Mail.

The profit level to POL

In order to calculate to profit level to POL on the sales of Euros to Mr Whitehouse when measured
against the Retail Buy Rate, | referred back to my master spreadsheet which is included in
Appendix D to my report dated 16 May 2005. From the data in that Appendix, | produced a
calculation which is included in this supplementary report at Appendix A.

My calculation shows that during the indictment period, the profit achieved by POL on sales of
Euros to Mr Whitehouse, when measured against the Retail Buy Rate was £24,505. This means
that over the period, Euros had been sold from Rugeley Post Office to Mr Whitehouse at a value
greater than they were initially booked into the Forde Moneychanger (“FM”) system in the Bureau
de Change, to the value of £24,505.

in order to arrive at this figure, | compared the sales value (in Sterling) of all Euro sale transactions
to Mr Whitehouse with the purchase “cost” of those Euros to Rugeley Post Office, as calculated at
the Retail Buy Rate. Due to gaps in the information provided to me, as set out in my report dated
16 May 2005, | have had to make some assumptions in arriving at this figure, as set out below.

| have ignored 20 sale transactions that were included on Appendix D, but for which the FM fill rolls
are missing. Without these till rolls, | am unable to verify the number of Euros sold, the precise
transaction date or the Retail Sell Rate applied to Mr Whitehouse.

In some instances, | do not have a Retail Buy Rate for the Euros sold. On those occasions, |
applied the Retail Buy Rate that was most recently available prior to the transaction date.

For example, | did not have details of the Retail Buy Rate on 10 August 2002 but used the Rate
applicable for 9 August 2002 instead.

My only departure from this method was for the period 24 July 2002 to 5 August 2002 where there
are substantial numbers of FM till rolls missing. For this period of twelve days, | applied a Retail
Buy Rate of 1.6659, this being the average of the Retail Buy Rates on the 23 July 2002 (1.6477)
and 6 August 2002 (1.6841).

These assumed Retail Buy Rates apply to 25 transactions and affect my estimate of the profit by
reducing it £757. The profit of £24,505 is net of this reduction.

Evidence of Mr Stacey about a payment of £241,194.62 to FRTS

According to Mr Stacey, in March 2002, the POL in partnership with Bank of Ireland formed a joint
venture company called FRTS to provide wholesale currency to the Post Office network. Under
the contractual arrangements, all income generated from foreign currency transactions is paid to
FRTS which then pays a rebate to POL based on transactions carried out on its behalf. POL also
receives 50% of dividends declared by FRTS.

Mr Stacey states that a sum of £241,194.62 had been paid in income to FRTS in relation to the
transactions with Mr Whitehouse but which represented income that had not been generated at the
time the transactions had taken place. Mr Stacey goes on to state that this amount has since been
repaid to POL by FRTS.

| set out firstly below comments on the losses incurred by POL and the effect on those losses of
the repayment of £241,194.62 by FRTS. | then comment on the overall loss to POL.

At pages 5 and 6 of his statement, Mr Stacey takes a transaction with Mr Whitehouse as an
example to illustrate the loss incurred by POL.

For each transaction with Mr Whitehouse, the loss to POL may be considered as arising in two
parts: the actual cash loss; and the loss of opportunity to make a normal level of profit. By
reference to the transaction cited by Mr Stacey | examine each of these loss calculations.

The actual cash loss is the amount that POL pays FRTS for the currency, less the amount for
which that currency was sold to Mr Whitehouse. in Mr Stacey's example the actual cash loss is:

Amount paid to FRTS (€150,000 @ Wholesale Buy Rate, 1.5520) £96,949
Less: Amount received from Mr Whitehouse (€150,000 @ 1.65) £90,909
Actual cash loss £5,740

It is alleged that POL also lost the opportunity to make a normal level of profit on the sale of the
€150,000, which is calculated as

Normal sales value (€150,000 @ Retail Seil Rate, 1.5117) £99,226
Less: Amount paid by POL to FRTS (€150,000 @ Wholesale Buy Rate, 1.5520) £96,649
Loss of opportunity to make a profit £2,577

The total loss to POL, on the above calculations, is therefore £8,317 (£5,740 + £2,577), the same
figure that Mr Stacey calculates.

In fact, POL has not lost the opportunity to make a profit of £2,577 as a result of the alleged
conspiracy between Mr Whitehouse and Mr Page. In my opinion the opportunity did not exist to
sell the Euros to Mr Whitehouse at the Retail Sell Rate in the first place; he would not have
purchased them at that rate.

The actual loss suffered by POL is therefore the cash loss element only. Further, on Mr Stacey's
evidence, the actual cash loss is reduced by the repayment from FRTS that he has identified. In
total this was £241,194.94, but in relation to the particular transaction of €150,000 the repayment
is £2,577.

Therefore, in my opinion the loss to POL on the €150,000 example in Mr Stacey's statement is
£3,163 (£5,740 cash loss less £2,577 repaid by FRTS).

'have not seen a detailed calculation of the £241,194.94 repaid to POL by FRTS, so | am unable
to comment on whether that figure is correctly calculated.

This reasoning that | set out above has a bearing on the overall calculation of the loss to POL,
which should be stated after deduction of the loss of opportunity to make a profit and after
deduction of the £241,194.94 repaid to POL by FRTS.

The prosecution have calculated the loss of profit to POL at £393,881.54 (effectively the cash loss
described above; being the difference between the amounts paid by POL to FRTS and the
amounts paid by Mr Whitehouse) and £592,802.74 (effectively including the alleged loss of
Opportunity to make a normal profit; that is, stated at the normal level of profit that would have
been achieved if all the Whitehouse transactions were sold at the Retail Sell Rate). In my opinion,
based on the reasoning above, the loss of profit to POL is £152,686.60 (£393,881.54 less
£241,194.94).

Auditing methods used by Royal Mail

Reference is made throughout prosecution witness statements to audit work carried out at Rugeley
‘sub post office by Roya! Mail staff.

| have serious reservations that the work carried out did not constitute an audit in the sense that

data was not verified back to source documentation nor critically examined before conclusions
were drawn.

| have carried out only a limited review of the audit schedules disclosed to me but | have identified
two serious shortcomings that indicate the work carried by Royal Mail was more akin to a stock
take than an audit. As such, the findings of that work cannot be relied upon to the same extent as
if they were derived from audited figures. | set out below two examples.

Firstly, | attach at Appendix B a copy of the audit schedule dated 14 January 2003. This contains
the “Audit result” of an alleged discrepancy of £645,345.18.

Examination of Appendix B reveals that the calculation of this alleged discrepancy is dependant
upon the accuracy of a “balance brought forward” of £553,429, which is itself dependant upon a
total of “cash and stock” balances at 8 January 2003.

| have seen no indication in the witness statements in this case that any audit or verification work
was carried out on the balances at 8 January 2003. If that is the case, then the Royal Mail cannot
be certain that those balances are correct and consequently cannot be certain of the amount of the
overall “audit result”.

Secondly, | note that mid-way down the right-hand “Receipts” column is a figure described as
“Bureau de Change - Revaluation”, £1,296.52. | understand that this is equivalent to the
“Revaluation Total” on Forde Moneychanger and represents the profit to Rugeley sub post office
On its foreign currency sales. | consider that an audit would have critically evaluated this figure by
reference to the amounts of foreign currency sold in the period,

! calculate the profit percentage to be only 0.2% against an expected profit of around 8%, as
follows (taking figures from the spreadsheet):

Opening stock of foreign currency £389,005.30
Foreign currency remitted £279,746.83
Less closing stock £(22,938.72)
Total currency sold £645,813.41

Therefore, the profit level is only 0.2% (£1,296.52 / 645,813.41)

2.34

| attach at Appendix C the equivalent audit schedule dated 27 June 2002. | calculate the profit
percentage to be only 2.8% against an expected profit of around 8%, as follows (taking figures
from the spreadsheet):

Opening stock of foreign currency £7,102.62
Foreign currency remitted £107,927.35
Less closing stock £(31,893.54)
Total currency sold £83,136.43

A “profit” to POL of 2.8% (£2,313.58 / £83,136.43).

These profit levels are much lower than would have been expected (as a result of the transactions
with Mr Whitehouse). | have seen no evidence that this fact was identified at 27 June 2002 and
brought to anyone's attention, not least to Mr Page.

In conclusion, if the work carried out by Royal mail constituted an audit, more would have been
done to check and substantiate the “opening balances” at 8 January 2003 before seeking to rely
upon them and the dramatic lack of profitability in the foreign currency transactions would have
been identified at 27 June 2002.
