Yes, thanks Graham. Needs to go to SSC afterwards to assess impact on any existing tooling.

(AKA Appsup role)

Andy

Bit of a convoluted email but if you asking if | care if we remove APPSUP access - Then the answer is no - It is not an issue in LST
test.
And if it is then | guess we will find it out and raise a peak to get it sorted in some way.

So happy to raise a peak :- Requesting removal of APPSUP role and permissions referencing PC208119 and routing to ISD to confirm
they are happy with the approach which may incur more overtime. All this as in Steve Parkers point 1 below

1) This needs to be accepted by Belfast Operations: Potential for more overtime for them to set the required access up for SSC when
we are working on issues out of hours.

Is that the sort of wording you want on the peak?

Where does the peak need to go after ISD? Host Dev ?

“Subject RE: 9b - Deloitte audit (AKA Appsup role)

Hi Graham,

Given the focus on this issue please could you review the approach again, as we must remove the APPSUP role from individual

FUJ00087220

support user accounts. If you have any concerns with this, then any suggestions to move this forward would be gratefully received.
Otherwise please could you raise a new PEAK, referencing PC208119, and send to Belfast Operations to assess Steve's point 1)
below.

And the platform owner (me) says:-

This is an historical issue (carried over from Horizon into HNG-X) highlighted in a previous audit, see Peak PC208119, which was
supposed to resolve the APPSUP issue on BRDB, but seems to have withered as Test rejected the PEAK fix and it got kicked out of
R6 (PC0221150 ), see below (copying Graham in). We need Test team to agree this approach is valid for HNG-X databases and allow
Host-Dev to redeliver the scripts for new SSC users (if they haven't made it into live). We also need a subsequent MSC to mop up
removal of APPSUP from any outstanding SSC users as stated in the PEAK. Steve Parker is correct that we need SSC to
revisit/identify any possible tooling remaining that relies on APPSUP and address any issues in SSC/Host-Des&Dev, e.g. via
supporttooluser.

Note APPSUP actions are audited via SYS$AUD.

>>>>>>
PC208119 Date:01-Feb-2011

Date:10-Apr-2013 11:20:18 User:Andy Beardmore The initial motive for this PEAK was to ensure all SSC users had the SSC role
assigned to be able to execute the data correction toolset on BRDB. Initially the SSC users were manually set up incorrectly against
the HNG-X BRDB HLD, being given the same permissions as per Horizon, and had too many privileges via the APPSUP role. Host-
Dev have delivered the live scripts to ensure new SSC users have the correct permissions, but a follow-on MSC is required to adjust
the privileges of existing users. Graham Jennings rejected this response as the approach is not consistent across the older Horizon
DB's. The fact is that HNG-X did not include this change to these Horizon environments, so | believe this to be a mute point for this
PEAK but more of an interest for PCI and other Audits. As such | am transferring this PEAK to the new security architect Dave
Haywood for further consideration of tidying up any existing SSC users on BRDB with APPSUP role, only to have RESOURCE & SSC
roles.

If there isn't an existing open PEAK on this, please can whoever is driving the Deloitte Audit fixes initiate one, referring to PC208119,

review the tooling for possible Host-Des/Dev implementation of platform fixes. SP item 2&3 will need addressing separately when we

Hi Gareth,

After my conversation with you on Friday Afternoon, could you comment on Dave's statement below. | think they all sound very
reasonable but | realised this was a HOST DEV area rather than Audit then it seemed sensible to run it past yourself first.

Russell,

> Attached is the Appsup doc Paul S dug out which | believe is the
> centre of the below debate.

Controls:

4.3 Fujitsu support staff will have privileges of only inserting balancing/correcting transactions to relevant tables in the database. SSC
will not have any privileges to update or delete records in the database.

4.12 SSC will have privileges of only inserting balancing/correcting transactions to relevant tables in the database. SSC will not have

any privileges to update or delete records in the database.

Question:
Deloitte phase 1 asked: "1) Evidence that the APPSUPP roles are the only roles which have access to update / delete records of

balancing transactions."

Proposed response (Needs agreement with Paul Stewart / Stuart Honey & Steve Parker):

APPSUP is a legacy role not used by the SSC, the team responsible for running transaction queries and corrections. The SSC use
transaction correction tool scripts as defined in DESAPPSPG0001 sec 5.6. The scripts operate as the Oracle
OPS$SUPPORTTOOLUSER and usage is audited. Any changes are made under change control.

Background (not for transmission):

The access to the Oracle APPSUP role is described in DES/APP/SPG/0001 v10.3 (sec 5.6 ) and DES/APP/HLD/0020 v6.0 (sec
5.6.2). | do not believe this role is relevant to the current SSC access and therefore Deloitte are really asking the wrong question,
which should be something along the lines of: "1) Evidence that the SSC roles are the only roles which have access to update / delete
records of balancing transactions."

Accessing the APPSUP role (Oracle user OPS$SUPPORTTOOLUSER) gives the user access to the roles table(s) for the current
database only. In reality, a number of scripts (see DESAPPSPG0001 sec 5.6) are used to make changes to the database when
authorised by POL; for example the removal of failed AP/ADC sessions. Use of the scripts and database access are audited and
changes are made under change control.

DES/APP/HLD/0020 v6.0 (sec 20.2.9) states APPSUP: "Used by the SSC (3rd line) users" and (sec 20.3) states: "Role has been
defined for use by ISD Support which will act as first line support team for the Branch Database". This is historical and it is believed the
APPSUP is no longer required in BDB.

DES/APP/HLD/0020 v6.0 (sec 7.2.12.1) states: "The shell script " (TCT BRDBX015) "will be owned by Linux user “supporttooluser”
and it is deliberately kept separate from the standard $BRDB_SH directory so that access to the script and the associated components
can be restricted to authorised users. The PL/SQL package PKG_BRDB_TXN_CORRECTION will be owned by Oracle user
“OPS$SUPPORTTOOLUSER’. The PL/SQL package PKG_BRDB_TXN_CORRECTION will execute with the permissions of the
OPS$SUPPORTTOOLUSER account and can only insert rows into the transaction tables as controlled by an entry in
BRDB_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS. The account will not have update or delete privileges."

FUJ00087220

There is nothing | can find in DES/APP/SPG/0001 or DES/APP/HLD/0020 that states the APPSUP role access is only available for
the time of the correction and must be removed afterwards. | therefore cannot see why we are not compliant with the current design.
Stuart, do you have a document reference / section that articulates your concerns around current SSC access to BRDB?

Because of the para above, | am inclined to retain the current level of SSC access on the basis the access is audited, performed
under change control and we are not violating any (that we know of) current design statements.

It is believed that the APPSUP role is no longer required (and in fact was probably never required) in the BRDB. We should plan to
have this role withdrawn from users and removed, assuming the platform owner agrees.
