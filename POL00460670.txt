Good Afternoon Jane and Tim

Ahead of the upcoming GE update, please find attached a deck outlining the update that needs to be provided to GE.

Slide 4 is a hidden slide — I’ve just included my thoughts on the back of the team charter activity, hopefully this
includes some helpful narrative that will reassure individuals that the new office space will work.

Included in the deck is
© Plan ona page for all project activity
* Summary of the guestimate of numbers that will be using Wood Street across the week
* Wood Street working principles for discussion
* Transition timeline
© Induction plan
* Comms plan
* Next Steps

For reference I’ve also included the office comparison and FD usage over 150 in the appendices.

Let me know your thoughts

Thanks
Juliet
