Problem caused by a storm of ‘timeout' events (KEL JSimpkins338Q). This is the third time this branch has had this problem in the
hast 5 weeks. PC0126376 already with development (Escher) .

spoke to PM, when they retried the balance this morning, all was ok (Cleardesk stops Riposte and clears the lock). They transfer
as not accepted in twice, so they have not got a receitps and payments problem. However she says the green giro reports aren't
consistent with the cash account - I'll check this.

[Start of Response]

problem is just between counters 2 and 7 - no messages done on counter 2 after 16:48 BST have replicated to counter 7 (which is
the one with the event storm, starting 16:48). Counter 7 does have messages from all the other counters.

It've advised the PM that the office reports done on counter 7 won't include cut-offs or transactions done on counter 2 after
16:48. Also that call e-0509210898 is still open and we are continuing to investigate. PM is happy for this call to be closed,
Jnowever I'11 keep it open for now to see if I can extract any further useful evidence.

EMPTY 31/01/06 17:40 UK957089 HSH2 Information: PM called in states a clerk has been logged on to 2
counters without being tranferred. 31/01/06 17:40 UK957089 HSH2 Information: Adding this update may assist you.

the timeout events are apparently fixed in a new Riposte version released at S90 - see PC0126376.

t've looked at problems reported on 31st Jan - can't see why the system reported disconnected nodes, nor why the same user could
Hog on twice (except that this followed a session transfer which silentlyt failed, for no obvious reason). I don't think there
ere any ill-effects.

It think the best thing now is to see what happens after $90. I'll continue to keep this call open to remind me that this site
should be checked then.

Since $90 was distributed, the number of these timeout events over the whole estate has gone
individual counter. So it looks as if the Riposte change has been effective.

closing this call at long last.
