1. Welcome and Conflicts of Interest

1.1 A quorum being present, the Chair opened the meeting and noted that
participation was solely by conference call given the current Government
guidance on home working. However, given the requirements of the
Company’s Articles of Association, the location of the meeting was agreed
to be the Company's Registered Office.

1.2 The Directors declared that they had no new conflicts of interest in the
matters to be considered at the meeting in accordance with the
requirements of section 177 of the Companies Act 2006 and the
Company’s Articles of Association.

1 participation in the meeting was entirely via Microsoft Teams from participants’ personal addresses. In such

circumstances the Company's Articles of Association (Article 64) require that the location of the meeting be
deemed as the chair’s location. However, it was not deemed appropriate to record personal addresses on the
Company record. As such, the Registered Office is recorded as the meeting location.

Postmaster Policies

2.1

Amanda Jones, Tim Perkins and Tracy Marshall introduced the paper,
which had been circulated previously and was taken as read. The following
points were summarised for the Committee:

How the policies work in practice and how compliance and

assurance checks were built in was a point of discussion at the Risk

& Compliance Committee. Therefore the appendices included

examples of the complaints dashboard and _ self-assessment

controls.

- The Guide to Policy Standards (the Guide) worked to pull together
all the Postmaster policies in one document in a way that was easy
to understand for Postmasters. It was recognised that this needed
to be more sophisticated and integrate with the Postmaster Support
Guide. This was the next piece of work, alongside the work to
update the operating manuals for Postmasters, led by Tracy
Marshall. Ultimately to be an effective, modern franchisor Post
Office needed better “how-to” guides for Postmasters covering
contractual obligations and how to run their Post Offices more
effectively.

- The intention was to roll out the Guide alongside the Support Guide
in the next six to eight weeks. This would be in the format of a hard
copy ring binder and digital offer (following feedback from
Postmasters), with regular updates available online. It was
recognised that some Postmasters would read it cover to cover,
whilst others will only refer to it as and when needed. The Chair
noted it was key that any hard copies were kept up to date. In
response to questions from Tom Cooper, it was confirmed that the
policies were not for publication to Postmasters, but were internal
and set out the standards Post Office was to meet. It was expected
that the Guide would lead to requests for copies of the policies from
Postmasters, but all policies had been prepared with this in mind,
including a caveat that they did not form part of Post Office’s
contractual obligations to Postmasters.

- Nick Read highlighted that key to the success of the Postmaster
Support Guide and Policy Guide was that it was simple such that it
could be used as a tool and become part of the Post Office’s DNA.
It was an important cultural change.

BF

2.2

The Committee then discussed the following points:

- Zarin Patel questioned how these policies would be applied to the
new express and basic models of Post Office and whether a cost-
benefit analysis had been considered. Tracy Marshall explained that

the work was on-going on these formats and she and her team were
working with the Propositions team to understand the new models
and how the policies might need to be tailored accordingly.

- Termination Decision Review Policy: It was agreed that it should
be made clear that the review panel was an independent appeals
panel not a decision-making panel. Amanda Jones explained that TP
discussions were still on-going on the make-up of this panel
(whether it be internal, external or a mixture of the two). It was
also agreed that Tim Perkins would revisit the timeframe outlined
in the policy for a 14 day termination period (see para 3.1 of the TP
policy) as Zarin Patel felt this was too short.

- Network Transaction Corrections Policy: The Chair noted the
importance of this policy. Tim Perkins outlined that an example
process flow (used internally) had been shared with the Committee
in the Reading Room to show that process maps are in place for all
processes in his area. It was agreed that Tim Perkins would amend
the policy to make it clear what the service levels are and how long
it would take to move through the stages of the transaction TP
corrections process.

- Qnboarding Policy: In response to a question from the Chair, Tracy
Marshall confirmed that the policy recorded the current practice but
that the onboarding journey for Postmasters was being reviewed
given the outcome of the Deloitte review. Continual feedback
throughout the process was also being solicited from Postmasters
who were currently being onboarded.

- Training Policy: Tracy Marshall explained that following the Risk &
Compliance Committee discussion, it was the intention that a
trainer would be on site for the first cash delivery, collection and
monthly balancing process. There were some questions at the Risk
& Compliance Committee over sufficiency of training and this was
still being reviewed. There was a view that classroom training
should be increased, but feedback was being sought from
Postmasters before any decisions were taken. Making certain
training mandatory took Postmasters away from their business so
this needed to be balanced against the need for the training. It was I TP/TM
also requested that the policy be updated to include minimum
control standards.

- It was noted that improvements in the 3% party / external scores
on the dashboards would be the ultimate measure as to whether
the improvements in training and onboarding were working. Further
it was key that the new Postmaster Non-Executive Directors made
sure these policies were operating effectively.

- Johann Appel commented that the minimum control standards
seemed to be quite high level, questioning whether there were more
specifically documented controls. Tim Perkins explained that the
minimum controls standards were high level and the self-
assessment controls had been prepared to ensure the teams meet
the standards set out in the policies. Appendix 11 included an

example of these and it was greed that Tim Perkins would share the
other control process mapping work with Johann Appel.
- It was requested that the Complaints Handling Policy be updated to TP

There were no questions or comments on the Network Transaction
Cash and Stock management policy.

2.3 Accordingly, the following policies were APPROVED by the Committee,
subject to a further legal review and changes/comments as outlined by
the Committee at its meeting:

Whistleblowing Policy Review
3.1 Sally Smith introduced the paper, which had been circulated previously

and was taken as read. The following points were highlighted:

The major changes were that Zarin Patel, as an independent Non-
Executive Director, was to be appointed as Post Office’s
Whistleblowing Champion and a new dedicated whistleblowing
manager was being recruited. The policy has been updated to
reflect these changes and to align with the Investigations Policy.
The Policy has also been externally reviewed by Protect.

The focus in this area over the next six months was to be on training
and awareness via an employee training module on SuccessFactors
and working with HR to ensure whistleblowing was part of line
management training.

Comments have been received from Zarin Patel outside of the
meeting to make some amendments to section 1.9 of the policy to
clarify the wording and make clear that the Whistleblowing
Champion is an independent Non-Executive Director. These
amendments had been agreed prior to the meeting.

Zarin Patel also questioned whether the policy should be
benchmarked in June given the level of activity in the business and
that this policy was still quite new. Ben Foat explained that he was
keen to get this done given the upcoming Public Inquiry. The
external review had shown gaps in training and engagement and
benchmarking would help the team understand what more needed
to be done.

It was also flagged that whistleblowing was not noted on the
corporate website. Sally Smith confirmed that this had also been
raised in the review along with the suggestion that whistleblowing
be part of the Annual Report and Accounts. The team was
considering these suggestions carefully to ensure a coordinated

approach, for particular consideration with the new Whistleblowing
Manager. This would be resolved within the next six months.

- It was agreed that this matter should be reviewed by the Committee
in six months’ time. ss

Accordingly, the Committee:

i. NOTED the whistleblowing review and its conclusions as part of its
role in monitoring the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s
whistleblowing systems and controls; and

ii. APPROVED the proposed amendments to the whistleblowing policy
(subject to the amendments agreed with Zarin Patel via email) and
the appointment of the Whistleblowing Champion.

Worldline, IT have requested the re-establishment of quarterly CEO-CEO

Andrew Paynter introduced the External Audit update covering the FY
2019/20 audit completion and commencement of work on the 2020/21
audit, which had been circulated previously and was taken as read. The
following points were discussed:

- The 2019/20 accounts were now completed and had been filed with
Companies House.

- PwC's fieldwork on the 2020/21 audit was due to start on 23 April
2021.

- PwC's view was that Post Office should look to approve its 2020/21
accounts in June/July 2021. The Committee discussed the likelihood
of this suggested date being met. Al Cameron explained that
whether this could happen would depend on whether Post Office
could be considered a going concern at that point as Government

funding was only agreed for 2021/22 and it was unknown when the
next Government spending review would be. This would make it
hard to make the going concern judgement for the next 12-18
months (12 months was required, but 18 months was usually
included). Otherwise, the accounts would need to be finalised in the
winter to meet the December 2021 filing deadline. Tom Lee was
completing a piece of work to consider whether Post Office could be
considered a going concern to January 2023 without Government
funding. The outcome of this would inform whether the accounts
could be completed in su i
completed in. April. 2021.

Ultimately, the point was
still being worked throueh by Finance and PwC and the Committee
would be updated in due course.

- Additional fees for the 2019/20 audit of £150,000 were included in
the paper and the Committee was asked to approve these additional
fees for onward submission to the Board.

- The budget and fees for 2021 were still being discussed, with
Finance and PwC discussing a joint approach to deliver efficiency as
a fixed audit fee was difficult in the current Post Office environment.

The Committee thanked the auditors, Al Cameron and Tom Lee for their
hard work on the 2019/20 accounts.

Accordingly, the Committee:

i. NOTED the External Audit update; and
ii. APPROVED the additional fees of £150,000 for the External
Auditors for the FY 2019-20 audit, for onward submission to the

Board.

Risk, Compliance and Internal Audit Updates
5.1 Risk Update

Mark Baldock introduced the paper, which had been circulated previously
and was taken as read. The following points were highlighted:

- The cover paper provided the Committee with a helicopter view of
the “big” risks facing Post Office.

- Strategic: This was largely focused on the ongoing impact of GLO
and the Public Inquiry. Central Risk were heavily involved with the
HMU and IDG.

- Postmasters: This was particularly highlighted by the Deloitte
Postmaster Journey review and the Central Risk team are involved
in the Voice of the Postmaster group. The Postmaster Policies (see

paragraph 2 above) articulate a number of risks and work was now
being undertaken to ensure these were correctly rated, mitigated
and tracked.

- Commercial: Mitigations were in three key areas: (1) the joint
venture with Yoti, (2) launch of click and collect trail with Amazon
and (3) sale of the Telco business. There was still adverse trading
performance, particularly for Post Office Insurance.

- People: Central Risk were particularly supporting on the culture
work and the Future of the Workplace project, considering, also
commercial and technological risks.

- Financial: Signature of the 2019/20 accounts confirmed Post
Office’s going concern status with net liabilities, but there was still
a longer-term uncertainty.

- Risk appetite: Central Risk have been supporting Tim Perkins and
Amanda Jones in relation to Postmaster risks and ratings as well as
providing some constructive challenge on which risks should be
focussed on. This will be presented to the Committee in May 2021.
The technology risk appetite would then be worked on.

5.2 The Committee then discussed the following points:

- The Chair was concerned that the technological and legal risks had
been recognised in the 2019/20 accounts as key risks but were not
highlighted as key risks on the Dashboard, noting also that the
Board papers for the same day also highlighted many technological
risks (including disaster recovery, PCI, Strategic Platform
Modernisation (SPM)). Mark Baldock explained that the 2019/20
accounts covered that period and given the other risks highlighted,
these risks had not been highlighted as key. However, it was agreed
that this would be reviewed by Mark Baldock ahead of the next
Committee meeting in May 2021.

- Tom Cooper questioned how well the risk appetite work was joined
up with the business risk work, noting that the risks (Competition
law and Modern Slavery) highlighted in the Legal & Compliance Risk
Appetite paper did not appear in the business risk report. It was felt
that the team had done a very good “bottom up” exercise, but the
“top down” piece was still needed. Al Cameron noted that there had
been a discussion at the Risk & Compliance Committee about how
this work should be prioritised, noting the other pressures on the
business. The Chair noted that care needed to be taken to ensure
that the process of assessing the risks did not prevent the business
and Committee “standing back” to determine if the resultant report
correctly covered all the key risks facing the business. It was urgent
that the quality of conversation on key risks improves. A wider
discussion about key risks was required and this needed to line up
with the risks that were being presented to the Board. It was agreed
that Mark Baldock and Al Cameron would consider this point,
alongside the prioritisation issue, with input from the Chair as
required for update at the Committee in May 2021.

The Committee otherwise NOTED the current status of key risks, the risk
appetite activity and GRC implementation (as detailed in the report).

5.3

Risk Appetite Statement: Legal & Compliance

Linking to the discussion on risk appetite under the Risk Dashboard
section, Ben Foat further explained that operating outside of risk appetite
was not the same as breaching the law. With Competition law and Modern
Slavery the issue was really about understanding why these areas were
considered outside of appetite and what controls were needed. For
Competition law, it was very much about training and engagement. There
were quick wins in this area that would bring the risk within appetite but
there was also a question of prioritisation given current pressures.

The Committee NOTED the latest position on the Post Office’s appetite to
corporate Legal & Compliance risks and the response to the comments
provided by Committee in January 2021, along with the proposed Next
Steps and timeline. Otherwise it was requested that Ben Foat and
Jonathan Hill consider the “so what” factor in relation to the risk appetite
ratings.

5.4

Compliance Update

Jonathan Hill introduced the paper, which had been circulated previously
and was taken as read. The following points were discussed:

- Controls Framework: A decision has been made to pause this work
given other work pressures and funding requirements. It will be
reviewed again after the summer. Compliance were still assisting
the business with controls, including the Postmaster policies. In
response to a question from the Chair, it was also confirmed that
the financial control framework was being moved from TriAction to
ServiceNow and, with the GRC implementation, IT controls would
also be on ServiceNow. In moving these controls, the system has
been set up such that it can be used for other areas. Part of the
reason for the delay in the framework was that it was felt it was
better to put all controls onto ServiceNow rather than using an
interim solution. This was a big piece of work which also required
funding and the Investment Committee had decided it was better
to look at this later.

The Chair and Zarin Patel raised concerns about the dependency on
manual controls and the recent organisation effectiveness work,
highlighting the need to understand what controls were in place for
the top 10 risks, such that the Committee could be comfortable with
this project being delayed. Al Cameron agreed that this was a
difficult choice in the short term and one key area for more clarity
was relationships with Postmasters which was a key focus of the
organisation at present. Jonathan Hill was asked to consider if there
were other key control areas that needed frameworks whilst the
wider project was paused. This should be updated in the next
Compliance report in May 2021.

Zarin Patel also noted that there were a number of control issues in
Post Office Insurance and it was agreed that the Chair would talk to
Amanda Bowe, Post Office Insurance Audit & Compliance
Committee Chair, about this issue and particularly how the culture cs
was being set from the top by the Board for consideration in the
next substantive paper.

The Committee was also concerned about the controls in Supply
Chain and asked Al Cameron to bring a paper on the issue to the
Committee in July 2021. AC

- Telco: The sale of this business was now complete and prior to
completion there were two matters outstanding: the comms
incident, on which Ofcom have now confirmed they will not
investigate and PSD2 registration for which an exemption has been
granted by the FCA.

- Data: On cookies, the website banner has now been updated to
ensure the agreed “middle of the pack” approach was adhered to
and the Digital team has confirmed the changes have negligible
commercial impact.

- Financial crime: The business was seeing increasing levels of
Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and investigations. This was
partly because detection has become more sophisticated and partly
due to the economic downturn (which often leads to more reports).
Tracking was done across branches and branches were also
encouraged to support. Where a particular issue was identified,
direct engagement was mobilised. The team was working closely
with the authorities and, particularly, with the banks and the Post
Office’s Banking Framework team. It was noted that the FCA
seemed more interested in what was being done by the banks and
the challenge for Post Office was to get the banks to stand up to
their obligations. In Banking Framework 3 negotiations and
discussions with the FCA, it has been made clear that Post Office is
an agent for the banks and that it could support with anti-money
laundering measures, but the accountability fell to the banks. Nick
Read explained that he believed the FCA recognised the role of Post
Office and viewed it as an issue of negotiation between Post Office
and the banks. However, the FCA were being lobbied by other banks
so Post Office needed to find a balance between supporting and
maintaining that it was not accountable. One option to improve the
situation would be the use of chip and pin for identification but so
far, only one bank was using this option.

Accordingly, the Committee NOTED the Compliance Update.

Johann Appel introduced the paper, which had been circulated previously
and was taken as read. The following points were discussed:

Internal Audit have been asked to support the IDG work and
accordingly, three audits in Q4 have been delayed into next year.
In response to a question from Zarin Patel, it was confirmed that
the approach being taken was that Internal Audit would review
improvements once they had been certified by the action owners
and the IDG as complete. Then Internal Audit would validate the
effectiveness of the improvements. Those actions with the highest
impact on Postmasters were to be examined first. The review would
consider the design of controls and their operating effectiveness.
The review would not consider whether the improvement legally
supports the issues raised in the CIJ.

The Qi audit deliverables were already underway, subject to the
approval of the 2021/22 Internal Audit Plan (see paragraph 6
below).

Three audits have been completed and reported in this cycle. The
Postmaster Reporting audit report was highlighted, noting that this
was a known issue, but the audit was rated as needing significant
improvement as currently the Management Information (MI)
provided to Postmasters was not fit for purpose. Tom Cooper
questioned what Postmasters should be getting that they were not
receiving. Johann Appel explained that there were numerous issues
including quantity, frequency (there was inconsistency between
branches based on their size) and format (Excel, rather than PDF
to allow manipulation). The key recommendation was for a self-
service option. Hugo Sharp also explained that Deloitte had looked
at this area as part of their review. The issue seemed to be not that
the data did not exist, but that it was hard to obtain. Ideally, there
would be a basic layer i.e. remuneration and then value add layers
to help Postmasters run a better business.

Al Cameron explained that there could be an opportunity with
Belfast Exit, SPM or Branch Hub to consider self-service
functionality, but there were big, costly decisions to be made. Nick
Read noted that management were setting up co-creation teams
with Postmasters to get them to articulate what they want, but the
challenge would be how to provide them.

It was agreed that what MI Postmasters should be provided with as
a minimum should be considered and an overview provided to the
Committee at its meeting in May 2021.

On the Historical Matters - Set-Up and Governance audit report,
Zarin Patel questioned whether the governance and process being
put in place was too much. It was agreed that Johann Appel and
Zarin Patel would have a further discussion regarding this.
However, it was explained that Internal Audit’s concern was the

time it has taken to put governance in place, noting that the role of
the unit had evolved over time, with the resolution of issues now
moving to the business and HMU retaining its “shine a light role,”
managing the Inquiry response, Historical Shortfalls Scheme and
criminal convictions appeals.

- There were no overdue audit actions.

The Committee NOTED the Internal Audit update, specifically progress
being made with delivery of the Internal Audit programme and completion
of audit actions.

6. Internal Audit Plan 2021/22

6.1 Johann Appel introduced the paper which had been circulated previously
and taken as read. The plan was summarised as follows:

- The audit plan was risk based and Postmaster centric, taking into
account post GLO activities. It has been adapted following the
request to provide IDG assurance. Much of this work would cover
the Postmaster processes previously proposed for the plan. Once
the IDG work was completed, Internal Audit would consider which
Postmaster processes required deep dive audits.

- There would be 24 audits: 16 core and 8 change assurance reviews.
SPM was a major area with 2 audits in this area. There was also a
request for ongoing assurance on SPM which was still being
discussed.

- This would be a dynamic plan which would start with priority audits
and a rolling plan, to be reviewed at each Committee meeting.

6.2 The following points were then discussed by the Committee:

- The Chair was concerned that some BAU audits were being put on
hold to support IDG work. Johann Appel explained that the team
were largely still catching up following the impact of COVID-19 and
the plan had been restated due to the IDG work. A shortlist of audits
(the rolling plan) to bring forward if the IDG assurance work was
less than expected had been developed. This included: review of
Horizon application controls (interim review until SPM), IT controls
framework and financial controls framework, review of ServiceNow
implementation (would cover the two frameworks), Postmaster
onboarding and remuneration. It was agreed that Johann Appel
would consider the resource and cost implications of bringing this
work forward and report back to the May 2021 meeting.

- Tom Cooper questioned whether the payroll audit (planned for
2022/23) should be brought forward given the pensions issue.
Johann Appel explained that a high level information review had
been completed to ensure previous actions were resolved but that
in his view, the pensions issue was resolved and there was no need
to bring the audit forward. This was particularly as the payroll
processes have recently been reviewed and were just embedding.

Internal Audit could review after this work was complete to ensure
it had worked.

- For the SPM assurance work, in response to a question from Zarin
Patel, Hugo Sharp explained a multi-line defence used, with a
rigorously checked controls framework and then Internal Audit
reviews via intermediate reviews and sitting on steering
committees.

6.3

The Committee APPROVED the internal audit plan for 2021/22, subject
to the comments made above regarding the rolling plan.

Update from Subsidiaries: Post Office Management Services (ARC)

The Committee NOTED the update from the Post Office Management
Services ARC with the Chair briefly providing a summary. Jonathan Hill
noted that the joint principal report covering the oversight of Post Office
Limited as Appointed Representative mentioned in the update was still in
draft and due to be finalised in April 2021.

Business Continuity Review

Jonny Lonsdale introduced the paper, which had been circulated
previously and was taken as read. The following points were highlighted:

- Jonny Lonsdale has undertaken a gap analysis on the Post Office’s
Business Continuity Management System (BMCS) alignment to the
BSI ISO 22301 (Business Continuity) standard.

- The Gap Analysis found that the overall status of the Post Office
BCMS was non-compliant with some aspects of the industry
standard, particularly Business Impact Analysis (biggest area of
concern as this includes the Horizon system), Business Continuity
Plans, Governance Framework and Exercising and Testing.

- The paper included next steps required to get up to the ISO
standard.

- Al Cameron explained that this work was part of a plan to formalise
business continuity, which previously had demonstrated Post Office
was good at reacting to a crisis but did not have a formal, forward-
looking risk assessment.

The Committee NOTED the summary findings of the Business Continuity
Gap Analysis review for Post Office Group.

Deep Dive: Dangerous Goods

Amanda Jones, Mark Siviter and Andy Kingham introduced the paper,
which had been circulated previously and was taken as read. The following
points were discussed:

- The Committee agreed that the paper was clear and they were
pleased to see progress in this area. It was recognised that the
issue was fixing the dangerous goods transaction journey so as to
address compliance. It was noted that in general there was a need
to improve the general commercial/customer journey on the Post

Office system to ensure it was manageable in a retail environment.
As such other journeys were also being reviewed.

- The changes to Horizon (menu-based alternative to the manual
scanning of the dangerous goods laminate) (Phase 1) was due to
be rolled out on 6 April 2021. This was expected to see radical
improvement in compliance and mystery shopping results. Phases
2 and 3 were longer term changes. Phase 2 (printing of dangerous
goods labels via Horizon) was dependent on approval from the Civil
Aviation Authority (CCA), who were supportive of the idea, but
wanted to run a pilot, which was now being developed. This change
was expected to improve mystery shopping results as many
mystery shopping issues are caused by the mystery shopper not
seeing the label applied. Andy Kingham was confident that the
deadline as set out in the paper (mid-June 2021) could be met.

- The Chair questioned the reliance on IT and particularly, Ingencio,
resources. Mark Siviter explained that as it currently stood,
Ingencio allocated sufficient resources and that this work was
running side by side with their other work at Post Office.

- Mark Siviter, Andy Kingham and Amanda Jones were asked to
return to the Committee in September with a further update on I MS/AK
progress and particularly an update on the improved compliance /AI
results.

Accordingly, the Committee NOTED:

i. the activity undertaken and planned in order to improve
conformance to the required process; and

ii. anticipated improvement in mystery shopping conformance as a
result of the proposed system changes.

10. Committee Terms of Reference Review

10.1 Rebecca Whibley introduced the paper, which had been circulated
previously and was taken as read. It was noted that the outcome of the
review of Terms of Reference was that most matters had been complied
with in FY 2020/21, save for a few matters which were outlined in the
report. Minor amendments to the Terms of Reference were proposed to
align these to the actual responsibilities of the Committee.

Zarin Patel highlighted particularly the need to review the quality of audit
and requested that Internal Audit should have an independence policy.
Johann Appel was asked to develop such a policy for consideration by the
Committee (for update to the Committee in May 2021).

The Committee:

i. NOTED the outcome of the review against the Terms of Reference,
confirming that the responsibilities under the Terms of Reference

11.

Foreign Currency and Hedging

11.1

This paper was presented to the Committee for noting and as such, was
not presented, however, the following points were discussed:

- The Chair questioned whether the Committee ought to be
concerned about the need for a manual revaluation process. Al
Cameron explained that an automated solution had been put in
place, but that this had not worked as required and accordingly, a
manual revaluation process had to be put in place. No money had
been lost, there was just a delay in recognising the Profit & Loss
and Balance Sheet split. Finance were presently putting in place a
stronger Treasury team to have more control of hedging, which was
previously being managed by the commercial business. It was
noted that the team were talking to Accenture on remediating the
issue associated with the automated system.

- Tom Cooper questioned the need for hedging at Post Office, noting
that it retains a level of stock in the system at all times and the
resource cost of this activity. Al Cameron was therefore asked to
consider this question and look at the material difference in FX value
over a material period versus the resource cost of hedging and the
degree of volatility hedging removes from Post Office’s results with
a paper to be brought back to the Committee in May 2021.
