Yep - let's do that.

In the meantime, please find attached my thoughts on who is responsible for the immediate next steps - I have

triangulated this with the team and hopefully it should help clarify matters.

On the broader issue, my general view (though Jane M may have a different view!!) is that:

1) The Project Sponsor is the GC

2) The project manager is Belinda C (however, it is the case that in recent weeks Belinda has not been sighted on
a number of key developments/discussions — eg through lack of visibility of meetings and email chains

splitting etc)

3) SME is provided by legal, comms (who have a very large role to play) and Angela VDB

4) Overall strategic and sometimes tactical direction is provided by the CEO, subject to the views of the Board

sub-committee

Hope this helps.

Cheers
Chris

Subject: Urgent - Sparrow

Both

This will probably be an unwelcome note for which apologies.
lam very worried indeed about Sparrow.

It isn't clear who is leading on it and as a result things are falling through the cracks. The latest is the rebuttal to the SC
which needs work.

The second is the team are in desperate need of resource. We are facing a concerted campaign against us but don't
have the bodies or support to handle it as we should. The latest SS interventions are deeply troubling but our

response isn't there yet because of the demands of the WG and other.

Finally we need to sort out the Patrick B and Tom position. All are now confused about who does what and we will
lose Patrick if we do not act soon.

We are also not using Belinda as we should. She is unclear about what is wanted from her before she leAves and yet
she is the key to all this.

I am sorry to raise this - but I must. Please can we discuss? We also need clarity on SRO.
