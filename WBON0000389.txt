Steve
I’ve gone through all of these documents.
I note that the key message in your response is a s follows:

“The POL Bracknell Team had no access to the live system therefore could not conduct any of these
transactions.”

However, the previously supplied emails appear to suggest that the Bracknell team could process, possibly on an
overnight basis, transactions on the live system.

Please see the following extracted quotes from the emails previously supplied:

“Although it is rarely done it is possible to journal from branch cash accounts. There are possible P&BA
concerns about
how this would be perceived and how disputes would be resolved.”

“Can you permanently disable the ACC for Forsinard PO 2528401 with immediate effect please?

I visited this branch yesterday and have sent money back for which the value of £5550 is still sitting in the
suspense
account.

This branch does not have CViT transportation and despatch rem pouches via shared service only and this
was the
cause of their previous TC's being issued which then resulted in a special audit being undertaken”

“Apologies all round. This was originally fastracked to the incorrect FAD code.
This will be done overnight and the Branch should be able to scan Special Delivery barcodes tomorrow.”

“Howard — can you remove the non-core links for Parcelforce services from this branch asap please.)

Giro deposits/withdrawals are a little different — the Partner screen contains these because I believe a
couple of the

Partner branches do offer these services to specific business customers so we were asked to put these on.

Unfortunately it can’t be varied for individual branches — all Partners see the same screens.”

At the moment your response is inconsistent with what is being said in emails sent between Bracknell team
members.

Can you look into this urgently and address this apparent inconsistency in an updated response?
I will also look again at the email data and see if anything else clarifies the issue

Many thanks

As discussed during our conference call this morning, attached is a re-worked response to Spot Review 5 and
supporting Fujitsu security and controls documentation.

Although probably of limited value, also attached is the Horizon test plan from 2008 — providing some relevance as

what projects were in the test space during 2008 — and an example test plan and report document (MoneyGram,
2006).
