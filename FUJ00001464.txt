This section details the Deliverables and Services that are the subject of this

5. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This section lists the identifier of each Acceptance Criterion that will be
demonstrated by the Acceptance Test. It also lists the Acceptance Test
Conditions that are used to determine whether (or not) the Acceptance Criterion
has been met together with the applicable test Phase, Technical Test, or Live
Trial.

Acceptance Criteria are split into three sets of tables according to the nature of
the acceptance method, one set for those tested by Acceptance Trial, a second
for those tested by Acceptance Review and a third which lists those criteria which
are for Acceptance at a later release. The Release on which Acceptance is to be
conducted is defined by reference to the Release Contents Description included
in the Associated Documents section of the Acceptance Specification.
Exceptionally, it may be necessary for one particular Acceptance Criterion to be
tested by a combination of trial and review in which case there are entries for
Trial and Review.

Acceptance Specification Version: 3.0
Date: 27/11/98

5.1 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA AND TEST CONDITIONS

Conformance of the ICL Pathway to TIP Interface Acceptance Criteria will be
demonstrated through Acceptance Trials and/or Acceptance Reviews.

Tests conducted by Acceptance Trials comprise practical tests using prepared
test scripts. If applicable the Test Condition(s) appropriate to a criterion are
specified in section 5.1.1 together with a description of the test. Detailed
composition of the test in terms of sequences of Test Conditions is contained in
Section 10. In the tables in section 5.1.1 the rows labelled Function Run Entry
will be populated immediately prior to the running of the Acceptance Trials ina
working version of the Acceptance Specification. These will provide invigilators
with references to the checklists used to monitor the progress of the testing. The
order of running of Test Conditions will not necessarily correspond to the order
presented in HLTPs because of the “physicalisation” of the testing. The Function
Run Entry will allow the invigilator to read across from the criterion to the
checklist.

Tests conducted by Acceptance Review comprise typically document reviews,

site visits or presentations. If applicable the Test Condition(s) are described in
section 5.1.2.

5.1.1 Description of tests conducted by Acceptance Trial

No tests are conducted by Acceptance Trial

5.1.2 Description of tests conducted by Acceptance Review

The table below shows which Acceptance criteria are to be met by Acceptance
Review. Each Acceptance Test will use the latest baselined version of any
document referred to in section 0.2 or below.

6. ACCEPTANCE INCIDENT SEVERITY

This section identifies the guidelines to be applied during the analysis of
Acceptance Incidents, in order to establish the severity of such Acceptance
Incidents.

6.1 HIGH SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a substantive impact
on the service received by the Customer, e.g. failure to pay benefits to the right
person, at the right place, at the right time.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a major impact on the
ability of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or where
there was a major impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES
necessary to overcome that impact on their business, e.g. failure to support
accurate POCL accounting.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would impact the security of the
service where there is no acceptable procedural workaround.

FUJ00001464

ICL Pathway The ICL Pathway to TIP Interface Ref.: CR/ACS/009

Acceptance Specification Version: 3.0
Date: 27/11/98

Consistent failure to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds for Service Levels,
e.g. where particular transactions do not meet the minimum Acceptable
Threshold under normal loading.

6.2 MEDIUM SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which is visible to the Customer and is
likely to give rise to an adverse public perception of the service, but does not
substantively impact the service received by the Customer, e.g. incorrect spelling
on a receipt.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a medium impact on
the ability of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or
where there was a medium impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or
AUTHORITIES necessary to overcome that impact on their business, e.g. non-
production of a weekly report, resulting in its manual transcription, which causes
additional resource or effort at every outlet of the average duration of one hour
per week per outlet.

Occasional failure to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds for Service Levels,
e.g. at peak loading, some transactions fail to meet Minimum Acceptable
Thresholds, but on average all transactions within the service do achieve
Minimum Acceptable Thresholds.

6.3 LOW SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion that is neither visible to nor has
substantive impact on the service received by the Customer e.g. presentational,
style and other cosmetic faults that are only visible to the user.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a minor impact on the
ability of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or where
there was a minor impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES
necessary to overcome that impact on their business, e.g. non-production of a
weekly report, resulting in its manual transcription, which causes additional
resource or effort at ten or fewer outlets of the average duration of one hour per
week per outlet.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would impact the security of the
service but where the workaround is as secure as the original solution (i.e. the
only impact on risk is in ensuring that the workaround is performed, but where
procedures have been agreed and are in place).
