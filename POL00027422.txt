CEO’s Report - January 2015

1. Introduction to this month’s Board and overall strategic priorities

e We start the new calendar year on firm foundations as we accelerate our turnaround
plans; this report provides more detail, but in summary:

o we have made significant progress reshaping the business and reducing our cost
base. Thanks to the efforts of staff across the organisation, we’re now only £13k
from our target to find £60m of run-rate savings in 2014/15;

o we have also reached an agreement with the CWU on Supply Chain and Admin
pay — without prolonged industrial action — which secured the union’s co-operation
on Business Transformation, complementing the agreement with Unite;

o our first wave of staff efficiencies is well under way, and there is good progress
across the business in changing the way we work, in preparation for the move to
our new building at Finsbury Dials. The building has itself been designed to make
us work in a more open, agile and efficient way. The first teams move in 6 weeks’
time;

o growth in Financial Services is key and this month we have launched the new Post
Office Money brand. Project Hawk remains central to this and plans are underway
but timings are under pressure.

e Iam pleased to welcome our new CFO, Alisdair Cameron, and Jane MacLeod, General
Counsel, both of whom will be part of the new strategic Group Executive which I am
introducing from the 1°' February. This will help me lead the business with clearer
accountabilities and ensure effective decision making at pace. I am also reviewing our
executive governance arrangements to ensure we continue to step up our focus on
becoming a commercially sustainable business.

Key issues for discussion at this Board:
e We have four substantive topics for discussion at this Board meeting:

e Firstly, Alisdair will lead an initial discussion on the budget for next year. Building on
the business transformation analysis presented to the November Board, we have
developed next year’s budget with the goal of maintaining year-on-year improvement in
EBITDAS on our flightpath to commercial sustainability. The paper highlights areas
where we have challenged for income growth and continues our expectations of further
cost reduction.

e The paper also provides an interim update on our three-year projections which will be
refined as part of the work to produce a 3-year operating plan. This is intended to help
establish a stronger framework for medium-term financial and strategic planning, and to
strengthen the culture of financial management across the business.

e Secondly, I have asked Lesley and Alisdair to provide a paper updating the Board on
progress implementing our IT strategy. The Board has previously agreed a strategy to
transition the business away from its disparate legacy IT systems to a more secure
platform, which will meet the evolving needs of our customers and agents and, critically,
reduce and variabilise our IT cost base. The paper summarises progress to date and
the forward work plan, as well as recognising the significant risks to delivery. Lesley
will describe how we are mitigating the risk specifically around exiting Fujitsu as an

CEO’s Report January 2015 1

POL-0024063
POL00027422
POL00027422

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

incumbent supplier as we procure the new Front Office IT platform. The paper also
draws out the actions we are taking to improve governance of IT change and
integration with the wider business transformation programme.

We will then be discussing a draft risk appetite statement for the business. The
statement is an integral part of work to develop our risk management capability to
become compliant with the risk elements of the UK Corporate Governance Code by the
end of this financial year. The various statements attempt to capture our risk tolerances
across a range of dimensions and have been refined following very helpful discussions
at both the ExCo and ARC. Work is now in hand to embed the statement into business
decision making. The ARC approved the statement for discussion and formal adoption
by the Board. If adopted, it is proposed that the Board review the statement bi-annually
in the first year, and subsequently on an annual basis.

Finally, we will review progress on Winning in Mails. The paper notes that whilst we
have made good progress on the operational and technical elements of product
simplification and network extension, we have made no progress in securing the
necessary commercial agreements with Royal Mail. This is despite the best
endeavours of the team and engagement at the highest levels between our two
organisations, and we believe it reflects a fundamental misalignment in our respective
parcel strategies. We are therefore accelerating work on a broader commercial options
analysis, building on thinking from our Plan B options. In parallel we will maintain
engagement with retailers and the NFSP, however we propose to pause rollout of
further access points and concentrate in the interim on a cost reduction/margin
improvement approach. The options analysis will form the basis for a strategic review
of our approach at the Board in May.

2. Commercial and business performance overview

Overall performance

As the CFO’s Performance Report sets out in detail, December trading was below
forecast but showed an improvement on the same period last year. Net income was
adverse to budget across all pillars but the focus on cost reduction meant operating
profit in the month was favourable to budget, reducing the overall shortfall for the year
to date.

Our focus is now on securing the EBITDAS target of £99m over the next ten weeks. We
held a Teamtalk event with the SLT on the 13" January to brief them on the latest
financial performance and galvanise them and their teams to rise to this challenge.

Mails focus

Mails income in Period 9 was ahead of last year, driven by the extra day’s trading in
Christmas week and supported by the Christmas marketing campaign and Christmas
Makers out in branches. Home Shopping returns grew by 24% year-on-year,
outstripping the market, however this remains a relatively small proportion of our overall
mails income.

The focus is now on growing income through Q4. This includes more targeted training
for Post Offices and poorer performing colleagues in the bottom 1,000 branches. We
are also currently evaluating the potential for scaling up a planned online campaign

CEO’s Report January 2015 2

POL-0024063
POL00027422
POL00027422

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

targeting SMEs and eBay sellers to maximise the impact of the small parcel price
promotion.

FS focus

e Banking services continue to perform well and the ongoing positive publicity is helping
raising awareness of our services. Another round table with Vince Cable and the
banking community has been scheduled at the end of January, providing a further
opportunity to discuss how we might expand our partner banking offer on a basis which
is commercially sustainable for the Post Office.

e All preparations to launch the Post Office Money Brand have now been successfully
completed. The Post Office Money website has gone live (www.postofficemoney.co.uk)
and the nationwide PR campaign will ramp up from the end of January, with the first TV
advert airing on 1%' February. The new brand is being supported in the business with a
renewed focus on learning and development through the launch of the Post Office
Money Academy.

Telecoms focus

* The Telephony business increased Line Rental prices by £2.00 per month from 1°"
January, and reduced the Broadband package price by £2.00. As a result Broadband
Dual Play customers saw no increase in price, while our Home phone customers saw
the full £2.00 increase. This will raise £8 million in Annual Revenue/EBITDAS.
Notwithstanding this increase Post Office remains the lowest cost provider in the Home
phone market, and we have not seen any material increase in churn.

3. Other issues and updates

Industrial Relations

e The long-running dispute in Supply Chain and Admin is now formally settled. The
CWU's Postal Executive endorsed the 'negotiators' agreement' struck on the 23rd
December and the subsequent membership ballot resulted in a resounding 93.3%
'YES' vote, on a turnout of 64.4%. The deal which was agreed with the CWU remained
within the mandate agreed with the Board.

e The result means we will not need to negotiate on pay in Supply Chain and Admin until
shortly before April 2017. More importantly, this confirms the CWU’s co-operation on
Business Transformation, while retaining our right to make colleagues compulsorily
redundant.

e lam sure the Board would like to join me in thanking Neil Hayward and his team for
their hard work in landing this milestone agreement.

e Neil Hayward and the IR team have now started a review of the CWU’s Facility Time, in
line with the IR Strategy approved by the Board last year. The aim is to improve
relations between our two organisations and to reduce the cost of facility time to the
business. The team presented their proposals to CWU Representatives in
Bournemouth on 14" January and aim to have a new framework agreed by April 2015.
Our parallel review with Unite is on track to conclude with an agreement by the end of
January.

Office move to Finsbury Dials

Significant work has been undertaken over the last 6 months as we prepare to move
out of 148 Old Street. The project remains on track to complete to agreed timescales
within the agreed budget, with savings being made on furniture and fit-out costs.

The Network Transformation team moves to its new site in Clapham with the first official
operational day scheduled to be 23 February. The remainder of our colleagues will
move from 148 Old Street to Finsbury Dials in a phased sequence between 9" March
and 27" March. Our next Board meeting on 25" March will be held in the new office.

Staff engagement is a key part of the project, including changing ways of working
(furniture, dedicated spaces etc) before we move. Most teams have embraced this
enthusiastically. We will begin weekly communication to ensure colleagues are well
prepared for the move itself. The new building and new ways of working should help us
become more agile, collaborative and ultimately more effective. New ways of working
include hot-desking, remote working and greater use of technology and we will draw on
lessons from trials over the last 6 months.

We are also preparing a stakeholder narrative, which puts potentially negative views on
the move and associated costs in the context of wider business challenges.

Government Services

PayPoint have challenged DWP on the use of the Front Office Counter Services
(FOCS) Framework Agreement. They have claimed it is an inappropriate contracting
vehicle for POca, on the basis that FOCS does not cater for Banking Services.
PayPoint have not challenged the award itself. This has led to a delay in DWP signing
the new POca contract with POL.

DWP have made a “robust” response to the PayPoint challenge and assured us this
presents a delay to the process rather than a serious challenge. BIS colleagues share
this view and have shared advice from the EU Commission confirming they regard
FOCS as a suitable contract vehicle for POca. The risk from a delay is that the £9.8m
additional POca revenue negotiated for 2014-15 may be at risk. Currently we regard
this risk as low but are monitoring the situation daily.

DWP officials have indicated they expect to enter into formal discussions on the Call-
Off Agreement later in January, confirming their intention to continue using the FOCS
Call-Off Agreement process.

Sparrow

We have now completed investigations for all cases in the Scheme. To date, we have
found no evidence, nor has any been provided by either an Applicant or Second Sight,
of either faults with the Horizon system or unsafe convictions, and we are not aware
that any convictions have been appealed.

The strategy agreed with the Board last summer has, not unexpectedly, resulted in a
concerted attempt by JFSA to use MPs and the media to apply pressure on Post Office
to mediate all cases. Although JFSA have said that they plan to stay in the Scheme,
we believe that they are gathering information through the Scheme to use in litigation
against us.

Media interest to date has been limited but unwelcome and distracting. The coverage is
being generated by a small number of journalists. We are taking a very proactive

position in challenging journalists, combining legal and editorial approaches, including
to senior figures in relevant organisations. We will maintain our communications
strategy focussing on providing a firm, measured and proportionate response to key
audiences on the central allegation of faults within the Horizon system.

e We have been invited to attend an evidence session of the BIS Select Committee on
the 3 February, which will be an opportunity to state our case for the formal record.

e Mark Davies and Chris Aujard will provide a verbal update on Sparrow at the Board
meeting.

4. Update on key change programmes

Detailed updates are provided in separate Board papers this month for a number of the
change programmes:

a) Crown Transformation Programme

b) Network Transformation Programme

c) ‘Win in Mails’

d) Business Transformation

f) IT Transformation

To minimise duplication, this report summarises progress on the other programmes.
e) Separation

Status overview: The programme remains on track to deliver against the revised MSA
deadlines. Progress on migrating to a dedicated Post Office admin IT Network is
progressing well, and at the end of Dec 145 (of 352) sites have now been fully separated
from Royal Mail. The remaining sites are planned to migrate through Q1 2015. Our Contact
Centre estate is now also separated from Royal Mail, and the programme continues to
provide operational warranty support prior to handover into business as usual.

5. Market, political and external developments

e Retail — Christmas Trading Reports. In 2014 customers spent £104bn on e-retail, a
14% growth on the previous year. During the Christmas Trading period (2/11 - 27/12)
customers spent £21.6bn, an increase of 13% on last year. These rates of growth are
being translated into the Home Shopping Returns market which has grown by c8% on
last year. Online e-retail now accounts for 24% of retail sales and next year is expected
to grow by 12% to £116bn. However, within these numbers are some interesting
emerging trends.

o Whilst the overall Christmas performance is in line with expectation,
December trading was only 5% up on last year. This is being linked to the rise
of Black Friday which saw 17% of Christmas sales happen in the w/c 23
November, with an estimated £810m being spent on Black Friday (alone the
biggest ever day for on line sales).

o Sales via smartphones and tablet devices recorded a 55% growth on the
same period in 2013. £8bn was spent via mobiles this Christmas, compared
to £5.1bn last year. 37% of online sales are now made on a mobile device; an
estimated 8.9% of total retail sales.

e City Link entered administration. The parcel delivery firm entered administration on
Christmas Eve. Administrator Hunter Kelly, of Ernst and Young, said, "City Link Limited
has incurred substantial losses over several years. These losses reflect a combination
of intense competition in the sector, changing customer and parcel recipient
preferences, and difficulties for the company in reducing its cost base."

e BT signals intent for mobile market with exclusive negotiations to buy EE. BT has
decided to pursue negotiations to buy EE for £12.5bn. The sale of the acquisition has
raised concerns about the potential control BT will have of Britain's airwaves. Barclay's
analysts estimated synergies would be worth £5bn. It is thought BT will use Wi-Fi
hotspots, new miniature masts and whole sale deals to use the EE 4G network to
undercut rival mobile operators. BT sees negotiations to buy EE as an accelerator for
its ambitions in the mobile market and ultimately its quad-play offering.

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD

2014-15 Financial Performance and Scorecard

1. Purpose
The purpose of these papers is to update the Board on:

1.1. the financial performance in December 2014 and YTD;

1.2. the expected financial outcome for 2014-15; and

1.3. the expected outcome on the performance scorecard.

2. Results

2.1. I The performance for December 2014 and YTD and the implications for the full
year outturn are set out in the attached slide deck. In addition, the standard
performance reporting pack is attached, with the usual appendix available in
the Reading Room.

2.2. In summary, income continued below budget for December 2014. However,
income was slightly ahead of the prior year, including in Mails. Improved cost
focus started to deliver benefits and the YTD profit shortfall to plan narrowed
from £18m at the end of Quarter 2 to £13m. The business is on track to
deliver run rate cost reductions of £60m by the year-end.

2.3. The full year profit forecast has increased from £85m to £95m and the
business is seeking to recover to £99m during Q4, hitting plan. In addition to
delivering the core trading result, this requires the business to deliver a
number of one-off items, including the DWP signature on POCA. This has
been challenged by Paypoint and the impact if the contract is not signed is
estimated at £9.8m per annum for 2014-15 and 2015-16.

3. Recommendations
The Board is asked to:
3.1. note the performance and improved full year forecast; and

3.2. note that there are a number of key dependencies for this to be achieved.

December 2014

(Ceadtines

Operating profit before exceptional items in the month was £8.1m, £0.5m favourable to budget, bringing year to date operating profit to
£54.5m and decreasing the YTD shortfall versus budget to £13.2m (£34.6m adverse year on year, including NSP decrease of £30.0n).

~

Net income in P9 is adverse to budget by £5.9m, but £0.9m favourable to last year. This reflects the continuing shortfall in Mails and Retail
of £3.9m (mainly labels and delayed rollout of ebay returns). Telecoms was £1.9m adverse due primarily to lower customer numiers and
lower average revenue per customer. Government Services was £0.1m behind budget mainly due to fewer active POCA accounts than
budgeted. FS is adverse by £2.4m with shortfalls across all areas except savings. To achieve the FYF of £880m, net income for the
remainder of the year needs to average slightly above budget each month and £6.8m better than prior year each month.

Net income year to date has worsened to £45.8m behind budget and £7.2m below this time last year (excluding NSP).

Total expenditure (before project costs) in the month was £7.2m favourable driven by the favourable subpostmaster costs relating to lower
income, and the VAT recovery relating to improved recovery rates.

Total expenditure (before project costs) year to date remains favourable to budget by £35.3m.

‘The £60m savings task remains challenging but now with only £0.4m still to be underpinned, and with £1.2m in the ‘hopper’ tobe validated
(see page 7).

* Subpostmasters’ costs are favourable by £40.6m reflecting lower sales volumes and improved VAT recovery.
* Staff costs are adverse by £1.3m reflecting under-delivery of savings tasks primarily in Supply Chain and Commercial.

* Non staff costs are £4.1m adverse driven by a £10m provision for client compensation, shortfall in savings task delivery, {3.0m for the
Mails Segregation penalty payment accrual and other increased costs including postage. This is partially offset by increasedVAT recovery of
£12.0m relating to last year and £4.3m relating to this year.

* Project One Off Costs are adverse to budget by £3.3m reflecting unbudgeted spend for Sparrow and the ‘Journey to 2020’ straegy work.

CFO Forecast
The 03 forecast shows an improvement of £10m since Q2 to £95m (EBITDAS loss of £65m). This is driven by the anticipated newPOCA
contract and some further cost savings offset by further reductions in Mails revenue and a £2m reduction in FS revenue.

Crown Profit

The YTD Crown profit is £9.8m adverse driven by lower Mails income and higher staff costs and higher property costs due to tle delayed
savings for the new Facilities Management contract as shown on page 6. The Q2 CFO Crown forecast is a loss of £13.8m which is€4.9m
behind budget. This is aligned to the assumptions used in the business CFO forecast but excludes the contingency.

Network Transformation
The programme is ahead of plan at P9 both for contracts signed and branches transformed,

(Summary »
Income:

Income is £7.4m less than plan
At a business level this is predominantly driven by adverse variances in Mails, including Labels, Home Shopping Returns and Lottery, Government Services and Telecoms, with a favourable variance in Financial Services.

Line by Line variances are as follows:
Variable sales income is £3.9m less than plan principally due to (i) Mails - Lower parcel volumes, Retail sales and Home Shopping Returns, (i) Financial Services ~ shortfall from Life Insurance, Home Insurance and variable

sales of Savings products. There is a corresponding upside in savings retention income due to the income guarantee with Bank of Ireland. Premium Bonds and Mortgages are also performing above target. (ii) Government
Services ~ predominantly due to higher Passport check & send transactions. However, there is a variance in ‘Other Income’ that partially offsets this due to an element of the Passports target being held centrally in Other
Income

Fixed income is adverse due to lower than planned LIBOR rates for Card Account commissions,

Retention income is adverse due to a lower customer base and Averaged Revenue Per User for HomePhone, partially offset by favourable Savings retention income.

Other income is adverse due to the delay or phasing of new products, predominantly Energy. Passport Check & Send (actual income in variable sales) is the other key driver. There was also a central Financial Services,
target that is held here and being delivered within Financial services variable income

Costs:

Costs are £2.6m higher than plan.

+ Staff costs £2.0m adverse primarily due to timing of the roll out of Franchising and the impact of the pay review settlement where associated efficiencies are on going, this is partially offset by Crown branches vacancies,
including Financial and Mortgage specialist.

Other branch costs are on target

Property costs £0.1m adverse due to the delayed savings for the new Facilities Management contract which started in October

Central Costs are £0.3m adverse due to a provision for client compensation, impact of centrally held savings not being achieved, accrual for Mails Segregation penalty and higher postage cost, partially offset by improved
VAT recovery rates

Cost Management update
December 2014

Progress since P8 update
Value and confidence

The Cost Reduction Group (CRG) has continued to drive focus on cost management and after
further assessment of opportunities the gap between the in-year delivery of “line of sight”
initiatives and the total cost reduction challenge has reduced to £0.4m (from P8 report of £6.6m).
This includes £7.4m of non volume related saving in the Agents Cost line of the P&L.

Original Cost Management Programme £34.2m
Additional Cost Challenge to achieve budget £ 60m
Central Stretch to achieve budget £5.9m
Total Budget Cost Challenge £46.1m
Additional Challenge from Q1 EBITDAS gap £ 7.0m
2 underperformance adjust ment £ 69m
Total Current Cost Challenge £60.0m
Current ’Line of Sight’ forecast £59.6m
Gap to £60.0m £0.4m

Delivery and governance

Regular 121 meetings continue to drive focus on in-year cost management opportunities and
delivery of existing initiatives. The weekly CRG reviews business wide opportunities and potential
acceleration of the 2015/16 BTP benefits into 2014/15

Work continues to ensure benefits are built into operational plans for the 2015/16 budget
submission.

Strategic initiatives for FY15/16 and beyond

The overall Programme has progressed through Stage 3, designing the financial glidepath to 2020.
Work is ongoing to;

41) Identify a portfolio of incremental cost saving opportunities to achieve the £60m in-year
improvement target placing all the cost saving initiatives under the scrutiny of the programme to
ensure the expected improvement has the requisite effect on the 2014/15 EBITDAS outturn.

2) Ensure the benefits from these opportunities are sustainable in order to meet 2015/16
EBITDAS targets, moving towards £100m of sustainable run-rate saving by
March 2016.

3) Deliver the target operating model that will ensure the cost efficiency targets for the
programme (to 2019/20) are realised.

the FCA's when signing up the retailer as well as the regional managers focussing on these messages for those already converted

Agent

+ Customer sessions indicate that retailers are benefiting from greater footfall that should support their retail growth.
+ The footfall is delivering quicker but lower value Post Office sales which in tum should allow the retailer to utilise theirstaff in different ways or reduce their staff costs.

Customer

= Customer Satisfaction, extended opening hours and queue times all remain positive.

Products such as bill payments, etop ups, cash withdrawals and moneygram have delivered growth for these branches - with associated footfall. This has been offset in income terms by poorer performance

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD

Update on the 2015-16 Operating Plan and Three Year Operating Plan

1. Purpose
The purpose of these papers is to:
1.41 update the Board on the preparation of the 2015-16 annual Operating Plan;

1.2 set out the proposed approach to the three year plan and provide an interim
update on our latest financial projections through to 2017/18.

2. Background

2.1. The plan for 2015-16 is in development. A pack setting out the plan detail will
be circulated to the Board in February. Board members will be offered
individual review sessions prior to formal Board approval in March, both of the
plan and the associated performance scorecard.

2.2. At the meeting in March the Board will also be asked to review the first Three
Year Plan for the Post Office.

3. Budget - progress update

3.1. The attached slides set out the current financial expectations for 2015-16
relating to income, costs and cashflow, flagging some key questions on the
performance scorecard. The deck sets out progress in improving the
profitability of POL, the impact of the ongoing focus on costs and the
challenges, risks and opportunities in the recommended outcomes.

3.2. I The Executive Committee is recommending an EBITDAS target of (£35m),
delivering a year on year improvement of £30m to match the reduction in
Network Subsidy Payment. This requires savings in line with the Business
Transformation Programme, some of which are currently unallocated and
some allocated but ungrounded.
3.3. Further reviews of income, costs, capex and exceptional items are scheduled
with the CFO in the next 2-3 weeks. In addition, the Executive Committee will
finalise a recommended performance scorecard and bonus targets for 2015-16
4. Recommendations
The Board is asked to comment on:
4.1. the proposed financial shape and risk profile of 2015-16;
4.2. the questions relating to the 2015-16 scorecard; and

4.3. _ the proposed approach to the Three Year Plan set out in the slides.

POL-0024063

POL00027422

Objectives for the 3 year operating plan

v

* Key aim is to establish a stronger framework for medium-term financial and strategic planning across the
business, providing tighter control of our flight path to commercial sustainability. Specifically it should:

establish an updated bottom-up view of our 3 year financial projections (which have not been comprehensively
reviewed since the numbers for our Strategic Plan were prepared in Spring 2013);

identify, track and manage the key risks and opportunities to these projections, including the alternative levers for
driving profit improvements;

allocate and control the drawdown of capital from our balance sheet, ensuring projects are consistent with our
strategic priorities and funding constraints;

maintain live tracking of the subsequent benefits delivery of these projects, providing us with clear line of sight
through to the impact on overall EBITDAS;

provide an overarching view of our channels strategy (e.g. in terms of how we expect the split of income between
branch and digital to evolve over the next three years); and

identify where further work is required to refine and develop aspects of our strategy to respond to our evolving
market environment.

Proposed format and contents

Updated P&L, investment and balance sheet projections for the next three years (with the first year aligned with the
annual budget), taking into account the latest market and trading data, the impact of the Business Transformation initiative
and the other strategy work underway.

A log of the material risks and opportunities to these projections, which should be quantified as far as possible to
enable us to understand the range of potential financial outcomes and to plan accordingly. As part of this we will identify
which products/business lines have been included in our base case projections and what options are being held on a
reserve list pending further exploration (with a clear timetable set for reviewing them).

i. A3 year balanced scorecard - identifying the financial, channel, people and customer metrics that define the organisation
we expect to build over the next three years, enabling us to track progress along the way.

iv. Our overarching milestones plan - identifying the key steps we will be taking to transform the organisation.

A concise narrative overview of our overall 3 year strategy - including a description of the key transition states as we
move towards our target end state design and what this means in terms of customers, channels and products.

The plan will be a living document which is updated annually to cover a rolling 3 year period, but also actively
reviewed within each year to reflect new information as it emerges (e.g. project benefits tracking).

POL-0024063
POL00027422
POL00027422

Key principles for testing the plan

* While the plan itself will be regularly updated, we would propose testing the outputs against some fixed principles that
define the acceptability of our financial flight path and are not subject to continual review.

* We will provide a recommendation to the Board on these principles in March, which are likely to build on the following
principles which were discussed with the Board in November (see slide 20 of the Business Transformation deck):

Y no reopening of the existing funding settlement up to 2017/18 (which requires close control of our overall cash
position);

Y clear year-on-year improvements in EBITDAS demonstrated throughout the plan period, with breakeven
achieved by 2018/19 at the latest; and

v the profit run rate and balance sheet position in March 2018 should be consistent with a declining subsidy
requirement in subsequent years (off the baseline of £140m in 2017/18).

Key points:

+ Latest projections show us achieving breakeven in 2017/18, driven
by strong growth in FS and telephony offsetting the gradual losses
in mails and government.

+ Agents pay declines from 48% of net income in 2014/15 to 42% in
2017/18, as a result of NT, the shift in portfolio balance and
customer journey simplification.

+ Staff and non-staff costs are improved through the Business
Transformation measures, but offset by the costs of new income
growth (particularly FS) and inflation assumed at 3% pa.

+ Crowns savings have been scaled back to reflect a less extensive
franchising programme which delivers a better payback - a full
update will be provided in March.

+ A 30% contingency has been applied to the other savings measures
to reflect the level of delivery uncertainty at this stage.

* The income contingency line is a provisional allowance covering
around 25% of the aggregate impact of the following risks:

* more aggressive action by RM to reduce our fees;

+ failure to execute Hawk;

* further delays in the roll out of IDA;

+ slower growth in telephony (both HPBB and mobile).

* If all of these risks materialise then this contingency would be
insufficient and our ability to deliver breakeven by 2017/18 would
be undermined. We are reviewing and quantifying these risks in
more detail as part of the further work between now and Marc!

Key actions underway to improve balance sheet position:

¢ We are undertaking further work between now and March to de-risk the investment projections, identifying
which lower value programmes could be scaled back or stopped, and which areas need greater contingency

to allow for risks.
We are also conducting a review of our working capital management, which will report to the Board in May,

NB The cash reserve numbers shown in the table above differ from those presented at the November Board in that we have now takenthe
more cautious approach of excluding debtors (worth c£160m to the starting balance in 2015/16)- however these assets would in principle be

accessible if our cash position demanded.

¢ Updated strategy for the Crowns, covering the opportunities across both cost and income to help maintain a positive
operating margin over the next three years (to be discussed with the Board in March)

* Review of the opportunities for expanding our business banking service, which will be progressed alongside further work
on our supply chain strategy given the interdependencies

* Development of full business case for our digital strategy, which will articulate in more detail our annual targets for
increasing the share of income generated from online channels alongside the associated financial implications

* Review of our strategic options in the HomePhone, Broadband and mobile market (reporting to March Board)

The operating plan will also be informed by the further work underway to develop the detail underpinning the Business
Transformation initiatives and the work with Commercial and FS to explore the scope for new income opportunities.

‘End State Design’

1.6

There have been no changes to the ‘end-state’ design presented to the Board in
November. However a number of initiatives are being progressed within specific
Transformation themes in Q4 2014/15 to validate aspects of the overall design. They are
summarised below:

. Reduce Central Costs — Consideration of the merits of accelerating the plan to
BPO central support functions aligned with a review of IT Transformation proposal
to outsource back office applications [BOAT]. A verbal update on progress will be
provided to the Board at the January meeting.

° Win in Mails / Commercial Strategy - A review of our overall mails strategy and
the potential ‘Plan B’ alternatives to the current partner arrangements, which will be
discussed with the ExCo in February and with the Board in May.

° Reduce and Variabilise Network Costs - The development of an updated
strategy for the Crowns beyond the end of this financial year, covering the
opportunities across both cost and income to help maintain a positive operating
margin for the network, which will be discussed with the ExCo and Board in March.

. Grow FS - An initiative being led by the FS team to explore the opportunities for
expanding our partner and business banking service. Alongside the additional
income this could generate, we will need to assess the cost implications for the
supply chain business, and compare the net EBITDAS impact against the
alternative options for reducing demand on cash services.

° Win in Mails / Commercial Strategy - Further work to develop a full business
case for our digital strategy, which will articulate in more detail our annual targets
for increasing the share of income generated from online channels, alongside the
associated implications for capex, opex and income. This is also due to be
presented at the March ExCo.

° Win in Mails / Commercial Strategy - A project to review our strategic options in
the HomePhone, Broadband and mobile market. This is due to be reviewed by
ExCo in February and the Board in March.

Investment decisions in January

1.7. The Board is not being requested to ratify any investment decisions related to
Transformation at the January meeting.

Extrapolation of Cost Savings:

1.8 The cost savings, as outlined in the Transformation roadmap in November 2013 will be
baked into the POL operating plan. The plan is scheduled to be reviewed and agreed with
the Board in March 2015

1.9 The plan will re-affirm our commitment to realise a minimum of £100m of annualised,
recurring cost savings by the end of the financial year 2015/16 which is integral to the
overall strategy to deliver a commercially sustainable business within the plan period to
2019/20

Transformation Governance:

1.10 As outlined in the November update to the Board, the transformation roadmap is
structured into six themes to balance certainty of outcomes, benefits, cost to deliver and
risk. Accountability for the business outcomes, benefits and costs associated with the six
themes is held by specific individuals, with each theme led by a member of the POL senior
leadership team [SLT]. The six themes and their sponsors are summarised below:

Reduce central costs — Alisdair Cameron

Transform the organisation — Neil Hayward

Lean IT; via technology transformation and digitalisation - Lesley Sewell
Reduce and variablise network costs — Kevin Gilliland

Win in Mails — Martin George

. Grow Financial Services — Nick Kennett

1.11 The overall Transformation will be managed by a small centralised co-ordination team led
by the Transformation Director, who is a direct report to the CEO. The search for a
permanent Transformation Director is underway. In the interim the role will be performed
by David Ryan.

1.12 The Transformation Director will be assisted by a small management team, comprising
leads for five related capability groups covering;

Business Analysis and End State Design

Portfolio Management and Reporting (including the oversight of ‘small change’)
Business Case and Benefits Management

Programme Assurance

Stakeholder Management and Communications

1.13 Assignment of individuals to key roles is well advanced and is expected to concluded
before the end of the transition phase (31 March 2015)

1.14 The cost of the central coordination team will be funded, in part from the rationalisation of
the existing POL Business Analysis and Change delivery capability and leverage capability

Executive Summary

We have an IT strategy agreed with the Board to:

+ Separate our IT from RMG and build our own digital platform
+ Move to a streamlined and modernised IT architecture & supply chain model
+ Maintain continuity of service whilst transitioning services to the new model
This strategy delivers significant benefits in cost, capability, service continuity and customer experience

The case for change is strengthened by more focus on costs, an ageing IT legacy, availability of new and disruptive technologies
and rapid changes in customer needs

We have already achieved a great deal both in terms of outputs and outcomes and are learning as we go
Further significant investment is required over the next 3-5 years to complete delivery of the strategy

Future work will be complex, with significant risk — especially in simultaneously replacing front office hardware, software, supplier
and data centres

Mitigations are in place including integration through business transformation and tighter governance, supplier management,
business-wide pipeline management and plans for additional in house capability

Choices are still to be made about phasing and on rollout of further capability, all of which will be aligned with our Business
Transformation plans to create an integrated change portfolio

The challenge — an ageing infrastructure which we need to fix and align with
the new capability needed to enable our business transformation

CONTINUITY & COST

= Over 60 suppliers, contracts on poor
commercial terms and 80% expiring

= Key operational platforms at end-of-life
and could stop working

= Competitiveness has been killed in some
areas by IT costly to change and run

= Dated point of sale IT means we cannot
meet customer needs in the Digital Age

= AData Centre which is end of life

= Aheavy dependence on Royal Mail
Group systems and a need to separate

eBusiness, new contact centres

An Horizon support agreement to March 2017 was
secured with Fujitsu. 30% of Data Centre refreshed
to sustain service.

Procurement of the new supply chain initiated. 5
contracts awarded and in delivery. Key capability in
place for Service Integrator and End User Computing.
Offshoring of call centre capability.

Delivered £8m of the £27m committed benefits and
capability uplift through the Systems Integrator (Atos)

3. Our Transformation Journey ’

We are acting upon key learnings from the delivery of our IT
Transformation and Separation Programmes

Both IT Transformation and Separation have helped mature our approach to managing complex change
delivery. Anumber of key learnings are being taken into our planning.

ee ee

Strong governance to ensure timely decisions and challenge scope creep

Effective Business engagement and communications to manage change and mitigate impact
Incremental delivery to drive focus and early benefit realisation

Challenge to test and flex the delivery as we learn

Continually testing the business case and being prepared to stop

Securing key skills and resources; Post Office experience is critical and should be locked in - don’t
do as part of BAU

Strong dependency and release management as many changes overlap, impacting the same
suppliers, processes and colleagues

Risks to be actively managed — focus on delivering mitigations

Active management of our incumbent supply chain to minimise risk and cost escalation through
transition and exit

3. Our Transformation Journey ’

Our vision — what it will feel like for customers, colleague and partners

For customers

Technology will be key to transforming customer experience across the channels,
propositions and branch models, potentially including:

+ Customer journeys start online, complete in branch
+ Self & assisted access to more services

* Convenience e.g. book a place in queue via mobile
+ Browse online catalogues in branch

+ New services e.g. digital passports, identity

+ Book an appointment online

+ Virtual FS advisor accessible in branch or online

For colleagues & branches For Partners & Clients
Digital tools will transform productivity & user Modern digital technologies will
experience for colleagues centrally and in branch allow Post Office and it’s clients

and partners to connect our
products and services seamlessly,
improving competitive advantage.

+ Branch communications move online, easier
to access and saving print & distribution cost
* Social tools enable collaboration across the
central and branch communities J
+ Branch learning moves online, to be ;
accessed via mobile, PC or tablet ry
+ Manual and repetitive tasks automated,
freeing colleagues up for higher value work

This means we can share data,
plug in new applications faster,
and join up customer journeys
e.g. from the Post Office website
across our partner sites.

Customisation of platforms/solutions only when it
clearly enables growth, enables cost-out or mitigates
risk

So we will simplify, standardise and digitise our
business and our technology

We will exploit the value chain using partner and
supplier capability

Business IT needs are managed centrally and aligned
with IT strategy. Drive towards enterprise solutions.
Functional requirements driven from the business,
processes standardised across the operating model

New capability will have to be justified by the
EBITDAS impact and its enterprise wide benefits

Drives value for money.
Allows us to be more agility
We will be ‘right-sized’

To drive growth and cost efficiency

We are dependent on the business to
drive process efficiency

Our cost reductions a predicated on
digital, enterprise wide delivery

This drives value and builds
relationships

Business do not have to worry about IT.
Helps remove duplication.
Strategic platforms leveraged.

For us to deliver new capability or grow
a platform/service, the justification must

Key Points

* The investment spend is front-loaded to deliver early benefits, this drives a significant volume of change in 2015-18
Lean IT will reduce the cost to run technology, though with some cost added back in by new business requirements
Model assumes a simpler operating model, reduction in legacy systems, resulting in simpler and therefore cheaper IT
Fujitsu Estimated one off investment to support extension of Fujitsu data centre

There is much uncertainty around the requirements from the business programmes, may be somewhat lower or
higher

Many of the proposed changes are at the initiation stage and still require business case approval

Our Front Office supplier transition will be disruptive to our business, this was
anticipated and we have an approach to mitigate the risks and impacts

Background

Post Office is procuring a Front Office IT provider as part of IT Transformation. Fujitsu were part of that process, but
have now withdrawn, a risk we were always aware of and have planned for. We have 3 credible bidders for Front
Office - CSC, IBM and Accenture, and will be coming to Board in May 2015 to present the outcome.

Key elements of our Risk Mitigation plan:

- Proactive management of Fujitsu exit - Lead appointed and has started work

* Fujitsu service extension being negotiated, 6 months segments from March 2017 to Sept 2018

* Simplification of functionality, allowing us to use standard “ready-made” IT components for faster delivery

* The technology solution will develop and extend our Common Digital Platform rather than starting afresh

* Security and integrity will be key requirements in the procurement

* Potential incentives to new Front Office supplier to achieve faster delivery

* Close collaboration with our Communications team to manage external impacts e.g. Sparrow

* Selection of a capable supplier — all three bidders are credible, we will sign contract in May:

Summary

Key Points

The IT Strategy delivers key benefits; we have made significant progress in delivering our Separation, IT
Transformation objectives

We have made good progress in identifying the capabilities and approach to support BTr

A key dependency is simpler products and standardised processes across the organisation, without these our
benefits could be significantly eroded by building customisation into systems during transition

There remain significant risks to be managed. Q4 FY 2014/15 is the key period to establishing the plan and
mitigations, working closely with the Transformation Management Office (TMO)

The transition away from Fujitsu is technically and commercially challenging but can be managed. Action has
been taken to secure relevant expertise and to build an exit management and transition strategy

The Board is asked to:

Note the progress against the key initiatives within the 2020 Strategy (slide 5)
Note the progress on implementing the IT Strategy and alignment with BTr (slides 6-15)
Note the key risks, mitigations and contingency plans (slide 16-18)
Note that we will come back to the Board:
+ March 2015 — Strategy update alignment to Operating Plan
* May 2015 -—to seek authority for the Network Tower award
* May 2015 -toseek authority for Front Office Tower award

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD

RISK APPETITE STATEMENT
1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

1.1. Seek board approval for the risk appetite statement developed by the
Executive Committee (ExCo) and considered and recommended for
submission to the board by the Audit & Risk Committee (ARC).

2. Background

2.1. Defining an organisation’s appetite for risk is a fundamental part of the risk
management framework, setting the parameters for acceptable levels of risk
taking and identifying those areas where there is little or no appetite for risk
taking.

2.2. This definition of parameters, aligned to the Post Office’s strategic objectives,
provides a clear steer for management and improves decision making in the
organisation.

2.3. Setting the risk appetite is an intrinsic part of meeting the board’s obligation to
determine the nature and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take in
achieving its strategic objectives, as set out in section C2 of the UK Corporate
Governance Code.

3. Current Situation

3.1. The Post Office approach to developing its risk appetite statement began in
August 2014 with a presentation from PWC to the ExCo describing the
purpose of having a risk appetite statement and a proposed plan to develop
one. The ExCo tasked the risk function with developing a methodology for
articulating risk appetite and a straw man statement for review. This was
completed through a combination of researching accepted best practice and
input from individual in the business drawn from both ExCo and the Senior
Leadership Team (SLT) colleagues. Several iterations of the paper at both
ExCo and the ARC were required to get to the final version appended to this
paper for consideration.

3.2. The final framework introduced four levels of risk acceptance, ranging from
‘risk seeking’ through to ‘risk averse’. These definitions are explained in the
appendix to this paper (appendix A).

3.3. The framework also defined nine categories of risk. Whilst there is no
accepted standard for the number of categories we believe that the ones
selected cover the vast majority of risks that the business is exposed to.
These categories are set out in the appended paper, together with the Post
Office risk appetite statement for each.

3.4. Where possible, positive statements have been used to express appetite;
however, it should be noted that some of these statements deliberately set out

Risk appetite statement Chris Aujard Page 1of2 20/1/2015

POL-0024063
POL00027422
POL00027422

Strictly Confidential

to indicate unacceptable levels of risk and therefore the use of apparently
negative statements is unavoidable.

3.5. It is important to note that the risk appetite statement explains the level of
acceptable risk-taking in the organisation and should not be confused with, for
example, the commercial appetite for new business.

3.6. The debates at ExCo in developing this risk appetite statement were often
difficult and challenging. In the course of discussions tensions were identified
between different categories of risk and the willingness to take risk in each of
these areas. By way of example, the requirement of taking risks to achieve
growth (risk seeking) contradicted the appetite for risk taking in respect of the
social purpose of Post Office.

3.7. Once the risk appetite statement is approved by the board, the risk function
will co-ordinate a range of activities to embed risk appetite into the process
and procedures of the business. Examples of such processes are: investment
appraisal; business performance review; induction, appraisal and
development procedures. A detailed plan for implementation will be tabled at
ExCo by the end of this financial year.

3.8. I The board should also note that the articulation of risk appetite may change
over time and that it is common for different aspects of risk appetite to be
flexed up or down according to the strategic direction of the organisation at
the time; consequently, the risk appetite statement will be tabled for review by
the board on a six-monthly basis.

4. Recommendations
The Board is invited to:

4.1. Adopt the risk appetite statement as appended to this paper

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD

Winning in Mails Update

1. Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to:

1.1. Update the Board on the latest developments regarding Post Office Ltd (POL)
plans for Winning in Mails.

2. Background

2.1. At the June 2014 Board we presented a strategy outlining how POL would respond
to the growing competitive challenges and threats in the Mails market. At its core
this strategy centred on retaining Mails market share and improving margin to
create a commercially sustainable Mails business.

2.2. This was principally to be achieved by improving convenience through rapid
network expansion, particularly in urban areas, and radical product simplification
which would reduce costs in the existing network and make the creation of low
cost Mails access points commercially attractive.

3. Current market conditions

3.1. There has been a slowing of growth in competitor networks. Our activity in the
market (particularly our discussions with multiple retailers about network
expansion) has given us more time than we originally anticipated. Our main
competitor failed to meet its self-imposed target for expansion in 2014 and
potential retail partners are telling us that they are considering all providers before
deciding to enter into medium term contracts.

3.2. It has become very clear following engagement with most of the target multiple
retailers that our Mails access point proposition is most attractive to them, and
their customers, when combined with bill payment capability. This has
demonstrated that we must at least match the proposition provided by Paypoint
(Collect+) to be competitive. We know that MyHermes are paying retailers a fee
per parcel of at least twice Collect+ as a result of their lack of a bill pay proposition.

3.3. We still believe that convenience, particularly in urban population centres, is the
key battleground in the Mails market. POL will achieve this convenience through a
combination of network expansion (competing directly for the best multiple and
independent retailers), existing Network and Crown Transformation, new and
improved digital customer journeys and simplified products across its entire
network. POL’s current shortcomings in these key areas mean that we are still
losing volume share although the rate of loss has slowed considerably from
financial year 2013/14.

4. Development since September 2014

4.1. Since the last ‘Winning in Mails’ Board update in September 2014 work has been
progressing to simplify products and customer journeys as well as developing in

Winning in Mails Update Martin George Page 1 of 4
January 2015

POL-0024063
POL00027422
POL00027422

Strictly Confidential

branch technology to give POL the ability to develop new branch operating models
which provide the foundation for network expansion and help reduce costs in
existing branches.

4.2. A proposition has been defined which will provide the foundation for network
expansion through the development of low cost access points. This will form the
basis for reducing costs in the existing network through the deployment of
simplification and improved customer journeys. The proposition includes the
products which will be available in low cost access points and for Mails products
the digital channels through which they will be sold. This proposition is informed by
a substantial piece of customer research and has been agreed with Royal Mail
Group (RMG).

4.3. The capability will be launched in three phases. Phase one is mails only
acceptance where the products are purchased online in advance and dropped off
in store. Phase two will also see the inclusion of bill payment. Phase three is
planned to include mails purchased in store, cash withdrawals and foreign
currency. This capability, together with product simplification, provides us with the
opportunity to launch trials and support contracts with multiple retailers and reduce
cost in the current network.

4.4. The technical solution has been defined. The supplier (Ingenico) is engaged and
working on detailed designs for release of phase one (Mails products only) in
April/May 2015 and phase two (Mails products and bill pay) in November 2015.
The technical solution will be a new Paystation device which has the capacity to
deliver Electronic Point of Sale (EPOS) integration with multiple retailers systems.
This was assessed against, and selected ahead of, the tablet solution indicated in
the September 2014 update. The selection of Paystation was made based upon
the relatively low cost of the device compared to a tablet, combined with the
relative ease with which EPOS integration can be achieved and feedback from
potential retail partners on its simple usability.

4.5. Operational requirements have been agreed with RMG which include agreement
in principle to remove the need for weighing, sizing and segregating of parcels in
new access points. A joint online strategy has also been agreed with RMG
(although details of data ownership are still outstanding). These are both
significant steps forward as they allow POL to compete on operator and product
simplicity with its main competitors.

4.6. The solution has been designed with a view to the potential benefit of its use in the
existing POL network. Once this is achieved, the potential savings as a result of
shorter transaction times are substantial. A dedicated programme is now being
established in line with business transformation delivery to expand this
simplification work to include all product pillars, alongside product rationalisation,
refinement and new developments.

5. Current situation

5.1.We have achieved the roll out of 150 home shopping returns access points
(Project Ivy) which has provided us with some valuable learning points particularly
regarding training and branch support. However, it is clear that these access
points are not a commercially sustainable model as volumes are very low due to
the restricted product range and low customer awareness.

January 2015

POL-0024063
POL00027422
POL00027422

Strictly Confidential

5.2. It now appears inadvisable to expand the network to 12k outlets by April 2015 (as
per the conditional agreement with the Shareholder Executive) as we do not
recommend the roll out of any further access points which offer only the home
shopping returns product as they are commercially unsustainable.

5.3. The September 2014 update indicated that we expected agreement with the NFSP
to be reached by the end of 2014; this has not materialised and negotiations on
network expansion continue. It is believed that the NFSP are keen to reach an
agreement but at a cost to POL. An options paper is currently being considered by
ExCo along with a request for a negotiating mandate. The urgency of reaching this
agreement has lessened as the growth of competitor networks has slowed.

5.4. The gap between RMG and POL on the commercial terms combined with mixed
messages from RMG on their support for network expansion makes it unlikely that
we can deliver the original plans in a commercially appropriate way. Nonetheless,
RMG and POL agree that a sustainable future requires a combination of simplified
products, improved multi-channel customer journeys, a better retail experience
and more urban access. There is therefore reason to believe that a win-win
strategy can be negotiated. However, any such negotiations will be complex and
could escalate to cover the existence and terms of the Mails Distribution
Agreement (MDA). We do not have a sufficient understanding of RMG's strategy
or of the implications for our business and network to engage in such discussions.

5.5. We have therefore decided to slow down the broader discussions with RMG on a
variety of fronts while we build a negotiating strategy. This will require complex
modelling and as such we will build models that can be used in multiple 'game
theory’ iteration. This will be supported by appropriate third parties, including
people with more direct knowledge of RMG and other competitors. Draft Terms of
Reference for this exercise are attached at Annex 1.

6. Next steps

6.1. POL will reconsider its approach with RMG in light of the work described in Annex
4. An update on this work will be provided to the Board in March with final outputs
to be presented to the Board in June. This will allow POL to maintain momentum
with network transformation, product simplification and developing the access
point proposition while re-appraising its approach to the commercial agreement
with RMG.

6.2. POL will continue to develop low cost access points capitalising on product
simplification. The outputs of this work will be used to; agree contracts for new
access points with key multiple and independent retailers, trial an urban area
flooding exercise to assess the impact on POL and its competitors. We will also
pursue opportunities to deploy simplified products and customer journeys through
the existing network.

6.3. Negotiations will also continue with the NFSP with a view to getting agreement to
access point roll out by the end of March 2015. This will allow the team to
conclude memoranda of understanding and contracts with the first multiple and

Annex 1 — Terms of Reference for reviewing strategic options for the Post Office in
the Mails market and its relationship with Royal Mail

1. Background

There is currently a misalignment between RMG and POL’s commercial strategy in the
parcels market: RMG believe POL should increase convenience for customers primarily
through increased opening hours and improvements to the customer experience. POL’s
recent approach to improving commercial performance has been focused on network
extension and product simplification, as well as continuing with the Network Transformation
programme.

POL and RMG see “Online Mails” as an increasingly important channel to the individual and
SME market: one which potentially reduces RMG dependence on POL as well as associated
POL income as it moves from a ‘sale and accept’ payment to a significantly lower
acceptance fee. There is a risk that, if we cannot reach an agreed joint approach with RMG,
they will pursue an active campaign to push volume and income away from POL branches.

It is also noted that, more generally, RMG’s approach to POL is increasingly characterised
by a focus on cost reduction e.g. calculation of annual count, format changes for
International Mail from labels to stamps, mailwork renegotiation.

In light of the potential implications of these issues, it is timely to step back and assess the
options available to POL that best position us to achieve our objective of commercial
sustainability in the Mails market.

2. Key questions

Given the material financial risk to POL’s future business strategy, the Exco would like to
understand -

¢ What is our ‘unconstrained’ view of the market that POL could pursue?
To include:
o Avview of how the market will evolve (including competition)?

o Which market sectors should POL compete in (where do we have a right to
play)?

© Which elements of the value chain?
« What is RMG’s overarching strategy?

o What are RMG's priorities in terms of channels and market segments?

What role do RMG see POL playing in their future?

What is their next best alternative to POL as a channel?

Where are our interests converging, opposing or neutral?

What value do RMG add to POL (and vice versa)?

How could we act as ‘one mails organisation’ and create “Win-Win” (e.g.

around product/journey simplification)? What would it take to do this? What
is the size of the benefit?

e Is the MDAa barrier to growth?

°

°

What more can we do within the existing MDA to create more value for POL?

What does our desired end state look like and what are the risks and
opportunities?

What would a rebalancing of the MDA mean in terms of P&L impact,
payments to postmasters? What do we each want? What do we offer?

How long would each option take to implement and what are the
dependencies?

Should we start again with a new MDA?

« What are the alternatives POL should consider if we fail to reach strategic
alignment with RMG? What are the financial and structural implications of
these alternatives?

To include:

°

°

°

°

3. Approach

‘As is’
Expansion without RMG support (‘expansion light’)
Renegotiate MDA

End exclusivity with RMG

The Commercial and Finance teams will use “Game Theory” to better understand RMG’s
strategy and develop “What if scenarios” to shape our thinking, negotiating tactics and model
impacts and outcomes. The deliverable will be a negotiating remit and ‘decision-tree’ of
possible outcomes and our potential response.

A thorough process of evidence collection and preparation will be undertaken with an
independent third party to help provide the best outcomes.

Key inputs will include a) market analysis — e.g. segmentation, growth, market size and
competitor analysis b) value chain analysis — where is value generated and shared across
RMG/POL/Agents.

Network Transformation, Model Performance and Crown Transformation Q3 2014

1. Purpose

1.1. The purpose of this paper is to update the POL Board on Network Transformation,
performance of the new models and progress on Crown Transformation.

2. Network Transformation — converting mains and locals

2.1. At the end of Q3 the programme remains ahead of target for contracts signed and
branch openings for both mains and locals. At the 28" December there were 4,622
contracts signed (1,947 local, 2,675 main) and 3,579 branches open (1,440 local,
2,139 main).

2.2. Throughout Q3 branch opening rates have been consistently strong: despite the slow-
down in activity leading up to Christmas, an average weekly beat rate of 37 has been
achieved. Strong performance is set to continue in Q4. The end of year target of
3,708 (1,650 during the financial year) should be achieved in late January, with the
forecast at year-end now at 4,000 branch openings. The programme also remains on
track to beat the overall end of year target of 4,800 contracts signed: the year-end
forecast is now at 4,950 contracts signed.

2.3. Engagement with transitional local branches (those modelled as locals with poor retail
and facing compulsory exit) has continued throughout Q3, with 350 branches now in
the process. This is more than half the affected branches, with the remainder due to
enter the process in Q4. To date, the majority of postmasters have accepted that
staying as they are with limited or no retail will not be possible in the future as income
levels reduce and competition intensifies. As such, the majority have either chosen to
leave the business on a voluntary basis (40%) or develop a plan to improve their retail
business and convert (30%). A further 23% of branches have expressed an interest in
selling their branch or are in the process of appealing against their model
classification. For the remaining 7%, where the postmaster has not agreed to leave,
convert or sell, Post Office is proceeding to advertise the branch against the wishes of
the postmaster and seek a suitable alternative operator. The engagement approach
with branches — coupled with proactive engagement with MPs and other opinion
formers — appears to be working as the negative PR associated with transitional
locals so far has been limited, considering the number of branches involved.

2.4. To date there have been 236 applications to the Community Branch Fund (156 of
which have been approved and 38 completed), with many postmasters seizing the
opportunity to increase overall sustainability through improvements to retail and
added convenience for customers. 81 completed applications have now been
received for open plan improvements with 6 of these already implemented and
delivering additional opening hours for customers. 60 applications have also been
received for enhancements to the host retail offer with 42 of these already underway.
Other improvements made include new signage, increased storage space to
accommodate Click & Collect services, and improvements to accessibility in branch.

3. Introducing additional compulsion for the last groups of branches not yet engaged
with Network Transformation (the ‘cliff’)

3.1. The principle of the cliff, as agreed in 2013, was to add further aspects of compulsion
to Network Transformation in order to maintain the momentum of the programme
through to the end. Excellent progress has been made with NT: the forecast of 4,950
contracts at the end of this financial year compares with a predicted range in 2013 of
3,750 to 4,400 at this point. Indeed, 4,950 is fewer than 300 contracts behind the fully

compulsory approach that was not pursued in 2013. It is therefore sensible to
accelerate the cliff if possible.

3.2. More than half of the remaining contracts needed to complete the transformation from
next year will not require additional compulsion: they are replacements for leavers
that will already be in process (either from volunteers or the transitional locals process
above). However, the cliff remains an important tool to complete the transformation.
There will likely be around 1,500 branches in scope for additional compulsion who
have not engaged with Network Transformation:

¢ 750 modelled as locals who have retail (600 indeps and 150 multiples)
e 450 modelled as mains who have retail (300 indeps and 150 multiples)
e 300 modelled as mains without a significant retail offer

3.3. The proposal is simple and straightforward:

e Notice will be served on these branches that they will be moved onto fully
variable main or local pay six months later (the optimum operational time
between announcement and action to allow branches to convert voluntarily).

e As per the approach and lessons learnt from transitional locals, we will take a
localised approach to engaging with agents and stakeholders. All 1,200
independent agents will be visited by the field teams soon after announcement to
discuss their individual circumstances and agree a timetable for each branch,
minimising the scope for misunderstandings and negative coverage.
Stakeholders will be engaged in the same time frame.

e Any branch who has not signed a contract or committed to leave by the deadline
will receive 18 months’ worth of their loss in pay (if any) in compensation at the
contractual change date (e.g. 1.5 times the loss of core tier payment for locals).

3.4. Branches have six months to engage again on realising the benefits of the investment
and compensation available to them through NT. We expect some to opt to leave for
26 months’ compensation, but most operators with retail will want to keep the footfall
and so should opt to convert. For branches modelled as mains without retail, we
expect most to leave.

3.5.In terms of timing, Post Office’s preferred approach is to serve notice on
subpostmasters as soon as practical after the election i.e. in June 2015. Delaying to
September 2015 — as per the intention of the 2013 agreement with NFSP and BIS —
or beyond has significant cost, at just under £2m in P&L impact per quarter's delay.
We have started to discuss this approach with BIS; subject to Board approval, it is our
intention to seek endorsement of the plans from the shareholder by the end of this
financial year.

3.6. It will be difficult and time consuming to try to secure agreement from the NFSP to
this proposal. Agreement is intrinsically tied up with the broader negotiations on the
NFSP’s future and network expansion. Slower or no agreement will increase the risk
that the current minister comes under pressure to prevent Post Office proceeding with
additional compulsion — or that a new minister post-election does so.

3.7. As well as the challenges of securing stakeholder buy-in, the other significant risk
stems from good retailers (independents and multiples) choosing to leave rather than
convert when they have to choose. This adds cost and generates a significant
replacement challenge. We will work closely with these retailers over the six months
after announcement to find a way to make the models work for them and provide the
benefits of Post Office footfall to their retail businesses.

4. Network Transformation — performance of the new models

4.1. Since the last performance update in October, model performance has continued to
improve, especially in local branches where the converted branches are now
consistently outperforming the control group (+2% in December, up from 0% in
September and -8% in January 2014). Mains continue to outperform their control
group (+7% in December, +6% in September, +4% in January 2014). Customer
session growth also remains strong, as both models offer increased hours and
convenience.

4.2. We are beginning to reach the peak of improvement that can be generated by an
improved customer environment and hours alone, and so have begun the next phase
of performance improvement, focussing on individual branch performance. We have
developed an individual branch scorecard that we have sent out to a trial group of 50
branches. This balanced scorecard focuses on customer, remuneration and
performance metrics to help identify areas for each branch to improve. It also points
them to relevant training and promotion material online, giving them the tools to
improve in a cost effective way.

4.3. By focussing on individual branch performance in this way, we anticipate getting a
greater lift on overall performance through a low cost and repeatable mechanism. We
are currently taking feedback from the trial branches on areas to improve and refine
the scorecard before rolling it out more widely. The encouraging results so far have
been the ease of attracting volunteers for the trial (nearly 70 volunteers replied in one
weekend to an advert placed on Subspace online, with many claiming that such a
mechanism would be very beneficial to them) and the willingness for postmasters to
interact indirectly (through email and Subspace), rather than the traditional and
relatively expensive methods of direct visits.

5. Crown Transformation- Programme delivery progress

5.

.CTP plan to deliver a total of 302 physical branch transformations. Of this, 287
projects had completed prior to the start of the 2014 Christmas trading peak, in line
with plan. The remaining projects are running during Q4.

5.2. Also prior to the Christmas trading peak, over 3200 staff had been trained under the
two-day CTP training programme. This formally completes delivery of the CTP
training project and this has now transitioned into business-as-usual ownership.

5.3. Income performance in those branches that have completed transformation has
consistently outperformed that of non-transformed branches. On average, income in
transformed Crowns has been increasing 4.0% year-on-year (YoY), versus 0.5% YoY
growth in non-transformed branches. A particular highlight is the 16% YoY growth in
Financial Services income in the transformed branches, a growth rate that is over 1.8
times that of non-transformed branches.

5.4. Despite some positives on income growth, the breakeven plan has needed to evolve
over the life of the programme to shift increasingly from income growth towards cost
reduction. As a reminder, our starting point at the time of the October 2010 Funding
Agreement was a position of a c£50m annual loss in the Crown network, which we
had reduced to c£40m by March 2012. The breakeven plan has had to iterate since
then, and the changes since March 2012, when CTP was formally established, are
shown in the table below:

(£m) (Em)
Income growth 18 8
Staff costs 12 20
Property costs 4 4
Franchising 6 8
TOTAL (£m) 40 40

5.5. Over the three years of the programme, the total staffing of the Crown network will
have reduced from c3900FTE to c2600FTE, a reduction of 1/3, through a combination
of efficiencies enabled in retained Crowns and staff exiting franchised Crowns.

5.6. CTP has delivered a reduction in the retained Crowns’ staff cost base of £20m across
the three years of the programme. Against the target of ending 503 full time
equivalent (FTE) counter staff roles from retained Crowns across FY13/14 and
FY14/15, 500 roles have so far been removed, and the balance will be removed
during Q4. There has also been a reduction of 66FTE branch manager positions from
branch templates, in line with plan. Staff have exited the business under voluntary
redundancy (VR).

5.7. A large proportion of the staff saving benefit was enabled through the rollout of over
500 of the new generation self-service kiosks. The rollout is substantively complete
and support of the devices has moved into business-as-usual IT. Branches with the
kiosks are, on average, conducting 60% of their mails and retail sales through the
devices, as opposed to requiring customer interaction with a counter clerk. During the
peak Christmas trading period, over 2.5 million items per week were sold through the
devices.

5.8. New duty sets have gone live in branches, synchronised with both the transformation
of the branch and the exit of colleagues under VR. Customer satisfaction has been
closely monitored through Voice of the Customer feedback whilst the new duties
embed, with “rapid response” teams in place to resolve any teething issues. The
overall satisfaction score in the transformed branches was 82% during Q3, a level
marginally higher than before staff exits from the same branches began in April 2014.
The “acceptability of wait time” score in the same branches was 85%, which is the
same score as in April 2014 despite the staff exits in the intervening period.

5.9.Work to progress the remaining mergers and relocations within CTP’s scope is
progressing well. November 2014 saw branch relocations go live in central
Manchester and Edinburgh, as well as the closure of High Street Sutton branch, with
its services transferred into Sutton’s Grove Road branch. A relocation of the Crown
branch in central Glasgow is also planned by CTP for delivery during Q1 of FY15/16.
An eviction notice received for our King’s Walk (Chelsea) branch has resulted in a
planned force majeure closure in February 2015, on which a public consultation has
now completed.

5.10. In terms of franchising, of the 70 branches originally planned to be franchised:

e 31 branches have so far gone live as franchises.

e A further 13 branches are planned to go-live during Q4.

e Between 7 and 12 further branches are expected to have contracts signed by the
end of Q4, for go-lives in the first half of FY 15/16.

e 12 branches have so far been informed that they will be retained as Crowns.
Whilst applications were received for running these branches, none were able to
meet all three of the success criteria required for an appointment to be made
(suitable premises, credible business plan and successful interview).

e In any other cases where a suitable franchise partner cannot be found before the
end of the programme, the most likely contingency will be to retain the branch on
a minimised staff and property cost base. This could be up to 7 further branches
retained.

A number of mitigations have been put in place to reduce the Crown P&L impact of

this gap, meaning that despite the fact that not all branches will be franchised, over

90% of the planned Crown P&L benefits associated with franchising will be realised

(c£7.3m of £8.0m).

6. Crown Transformation- Forecast Crown P&L position

6.1. Despite the programme's delivery successes and the outperformance of transformed
Crowns versus non-transformed, the rate of income growth budgeted this financial
year has not been achieved. Full year Crowns income is forecast to be £7m below in-
year budget. (A £7m outturn below budget would broadly align to a whole -business
outturn of £880m.) The primary drag is underperformance on mails, where income
has declined 2% YoY in transformed Crowns and 3% YoY in non-transformed
Crowns; against a budgeted 9% YoY growth.

6.2. The in-year shortfall on income will also impact the breakeven run-rate calculation.
This combined with the shortfall against franchising benefits, and the impact of
allocated costs of the central business not reducing to plan, would result, if
unmitigated- with the retained Crowns being at a run rate of an £8m loss at the end
of this financial year.

7. Crown Transformation- Programme response to forecast P&L position

7.1. A number of mitigations against the emerging income gap were mobilised during Q3,
some of which included new areas of programme scope. These are currently
expected to deliver £5-6m of additional run-rate benefit by March 2015 (down from
£6-£7m forecast in October):

e Changes have been made to the distribution of Financial Services (FS)
specialists’ costs between the Crown network and FS management teams. This
has reduced resource costs on the Crown P&L by £2.2m.

¢ Property maintenance budgets have been reduced and further reallocations of
property costs have been made for any space in Crown branches that is in use
by other parts of the business. This has delivered £0.9m of benefits.

¢ Further counter staff savings are being generated through the “Leaving the
Business with Dignity” programme.120FTE are planned to leave the business
and be replaced by new hires during February and March. The differential in cost
between leavers and new joiners will generate £0.6m of benefits.

e The force majeure closures completed at Albermarle Street (Mayfair) and
planned for Kings Walk (Chelsea) will generate £0.4m of benefits.

« Losses in those Crown branches which are not open to the public are being
significantly reduced. New contracts have being agreed with Royal Mail which will
eliminate POL’s losses for the two branches in The Royal Household. A bespoke
contract has also been agreed for the Post Office service in the Scottish
Parliament, which has eliminated that branch’s losses. With regards to the three
branches in The Palace of Westminster, a number of different options are in
negotiation with the Palace of Westminster authorities. These options have ShEx
and ministerial backing, and are designed to result in a break-even position. This
effect of all these changes results in £0.5m of Crown P&L benefits.

« Four branches are being transformed into Post Office Concept stores, sponsored
by the Commercial directorate. This will mean £0.3m of costs off-charged from
the Crown P&L.

e New product launches during this financial year provide only a part-year income
effect in-year. The full-year effect of this income was previously expected to allow
POL to justify an additional £2m income flow-through in the run rate calculation.
Although the budgeting process for 15/16 is still in progress, it is clear that
business-wide income will be budgeted to grow less from 14/15 to 15/16 than
originally planned. In such an environment, it is not possible for POL to claim
such a significant upward trend in Crowns income in the run-rate calculation.
Income flowthrough is now expected to be a maximum of £1m, driven by UKVI
and Mortgage product growth which disproportionately advantages Crowns over
other channels.

e Further potential mitigations were assessed but discounted due to them either
being unachievable within the programme’s timeframes; or them requiring POL to
break public commitments about programme scope.

7.2. In the event that income targets for this financial year had been met, these additional
actions would mean the P&L of the retained Crowns would be at a runrate of a £4-
£5m profit by the end of this financial year. However, the current forecast is for this
run rate to be at a £2-£3m loss.

7.3. However, it should also be remembered that CTP’s franchising project delivers an
additional bottom-line benefit to POL that is not visible on the Crown P&L: the like-
for-like change in profitability of Post Office services at the 373 Crown locations that
existed at the start of the programme produces £2.5-£3m of additional profit from
franchised branches. We forecast that by the end of this financial year CTP will have
sufficiently improved the run-rate profitability of branches in these 373 locations to
eliminate all the Crown losses that existed at the start of the programme.

7.4. The retained Crown estate has grown income (+4%) whilst operating on a staff and
property cost base that has reduced by ~25%. We are developing a plan to optimise
the profitability of these branches. This will be through the delivery of additional new
initiatives to reduce costs by at least a further £2-£3m during FY15/16, whilst
achieving 15/16 income targets. Over £1m of the new savings required will come from
efficiency projects already identified and in train, with the balance primarily coming
from new changes to the network shape and staffing. The formal closure of CTP in
March 2015 means that the commitments made to staff and stakeholders at the start
of the programme regarding CTP’s scope come to an end. The expiry of these
commitments offers further flexibility in areas including staff redundancy, branch
mergers, closures, relocations and franchising.

7.5. The scope of changes to the Crown network shape under CTP was set out during
FY12/13. As we move towards FY15/16, the changed income position and the
availability of lease breaks or expiries beyond April 2015 mean that further changes to
the network shape to eliminate losses should be made in FY15/16 onwards. Although
no wholesale franchising programme is planned on the scale of CTP, it is likely that a
small number carefully selected mergers, relocations, franchises and closures will
assist in delivering this cost saving.

7.6. Furthermore, we are assessing the market for new technology to automate POCA
and business banking transactions, with a view to these being used in projects to
further increase branch profitability in 15/16 and beyond. This will build on our CTP
experiences with very quick customer adoption of new technology such as SSKs, and
our proven ability to reduce our staff cost base through technology enablers.

7.7. These concepts form part of the development of the long term Crown strategy for
2015-2020 and a more comprehensive update on this will be shared with the March
Board. This will require a programme of investment (albeit smaller than CTP) to
generate further savings, and this investment will be sought as part of Business

Transformation.

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD

Project Ultra: Voluntary contract change for traditional contract holders.

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

1.1 Update the Board on recent taxation changes to Postmaster fees and the
potential benefits to Postmasters and the Post Office

1.2 Outline the details of a pilot which we are proposing to use to test how these
benefits might be secured at pace, along with analysis of the associated risks

2. Background

21 Postmasters on NT contracts and nationally managed multiples charge Post
Office VAT on their fees. Postmasters on traditional contracts pay income tax
and National Insurance Contributions (NIC) on their fees.

2.2 As a consequence of separation from RM, Post Office has had to negotiate its
own VAT recovery method with HMRC, as a result of which it can now recover
100% of VAT on agents’ fees (compared to ~30% under RM’s pre-separation
method) which is financially beneficial for Post Office.

2.3 Because it is not possible for us to recover any employers’ NIC, there is now a
financial benefit if agents charge VAT rather than Post Office being required to
pay employers’ NIC.

2.4 Postmasters benefit from a VAT contract in terms of cash flow, and as a
company Director, they also benefit from reducing their personal NIC deductions.

25 It makes sense to offer contract change now, as the mutual benefit is that
Postmasters can avoid employees NIC being taken from their fees, and help
Post Office to avoid employers NIC, by agreeing to contract with us as a
Partnership or Company, moving the relationship into VAT.

2.6 The National Federation of Subpostmasters have been consulted and agree that
company and partnership type relationships on a voluntary basis are a good
idea; analysis by Deloitte shows smaller sites will not financially be in any
different position than today (but will be better off than if the concession detailed
at 2.7 is removed), but an agent in an average size branch with remuneration of
£40k will be better off by £3k to £4k pa for almost no outlay; there are also
additional cash flow benefits for Postmasters.

2.7 HMRC are now reviewing a concession they introduced many years ago which
allows agents to treat their Post Office income as part of their retail business
income for income tax purposes. If, as seems likely, HMRC remove this
concession, it will be disadvantageous for Postmasters because they will not be

able to deduct their Post Office costs for income tax purposes. We are meeting
HMRC on 6" February to discuss this.

3. Activities/Current Situation

3.1 Although the mutual benefits are clear, this is potentially a large scale change
and very significant gain, so we need to ensure that we have a strong plan to
maximise the opportunity, informed by a small scale pilot; this pilot will tell us
about take-up, and will inform what additional resource / incentives are needed.

3.2 We will to write to 200 randomly selected Postmasters from our prime target
groups to test a range of pilot offers with different approaches to maximising
take-up, including NFSP involvement, wic 2! February. We will make a final
recommendation in time for scale-up from March, including any additional
financial incentives proposed to maximise our opportunity informed by the pilot.

3.3 Although we don’t yet know what level of uptake there will be, we have
calculated the potential for Post Office accelerated savings in the following way):

Number of sites on ‘traditional’ contracts at March’15:~6,000

Number of small sites we believe would only receive a marginal gain from
change so are unlikely to change: ~1,500

Number of sites left that are likely to change: ~4,500
Estimated uptake from a ‘whole estate’ offer is 10% of that: ~450 sites.
Net benefit from these 450 in 15/16 after NT impact: ~£0.67m

The typical accelerated saving at each site will be ~£250 per month for
each month up to NT contract change; the pilots will typically cost us
~£250, with a range of £60 and £500 to effect the different pilot approaches.

3.4 There are three unknowns to consider when estimating the potential accelerated
benefit for 15/16:

e Level of uptake
« Who agrees to change
e When they change

3.5 Note that this is an accelerated benefit because for the sites likely to change
will change contract in NT, and move into a VAT arena when they change - all
NT contracts are in VAT, irrespective of how they contract with us i.e. individual,
partnership or company.
4. Risks/Mitigation
44 Taxation is changeable; the VAT recovery method may need to be changed if
the business activity profile of Post Office changes, ‘though it is very unlikely a

change in VAT recovery will be significant enough to turn this benefit into a cost
for Post Office.

PART (A) - CIVIL LITIGATION

POL00027422
POL00027422

TE NAM ESS UN)
Horizon claims POL/RW Belinda Crowe /IPOL has received various claims from I This matter will be the subject of a separate I Bond Dickinson
(aka “Project Angela van den I subpostmasters (SPMs) alleging defects in the I update to ExCo.
Sparrow") Bogerd Horizon system and POL’s internal processes.

These allegations were initially made in 5
claims brought through solicitors Shoosmiths.
Similar allegations have been made by the
“Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance” UJFSA)
and advanced through SPMs’ MPs.

Following discussions with James Arbuthnot
MP and JFSA, independent investigator Second
Sight Support Services Ltd (Second Sight) was
appointed in July 2012 to carry out a review
into these allegations.

On 08.07.13, Second Sight published a Report
finding shortcomings in POL's internal training
and support to SPMs on the Horizon system,
but no systemic problems with Horizon itself.

Following the Second Sight Report, on
27.08.13 POL launched a Mediation Scheme
(Scheme) aimed at resolving _ individual
complaints made about Horizon.

The Scheme received 150 applications,
which are being progressed under the
direction of a Working Group comprising
retired Court of Appeal Judge Sir Anthony
Hooper (as Chair), POL, Second Sight, and
JFSA. 110 cases are still being progressed
through the Scheme or are being scheduled
for mediation.

Mediations have been held for the first 7
applications. A further 9 mediations are
currently being scheduled. The POL project
team continue to handle the applications in
line with the Board's direction to take a
firmer position, informed by its legal position
and tighter control over timescales and costs.

To date, no claim has been made against
POL in the civil courts, and no appeal has
been made against any conviction in the
criminal courts, following Second Sight's
Report. There has however been significant
recent media activity, on which POL’s

PART (B) - CRIMINAL LITIGATION

PROSECUTION CASES

There are number of cases which could have been prosecuted (e.g. those with full and frank admissions to theft /fraud), but prosecutions were not
commenced to avoid adverse judicial comment.

Several cases have also been terminated while POL obtains an independent expert report on the Horizon branch accounting system (see below).

There are currently 14 cases which are being kept under review as to whether a prosecution (supported by an expert report) can be commenced.

EXPERT REPORT

New experts from Imperial College London have prepared a scope of work on which formal instructions and a protocol for requesting and receiving
information will be based.

Appropriate individual confidentiality agreements will be prepared for both the experts and POL employees involved in preparing the report.

Meetings to progress the report are taking place between the experts, POL and Fujitsu.

PROSECUTION POLICY

Former First Senior Treasury Counsel Brian Altman QC has drafted a proposed prosecution policy for POL. Brian Altman has reviewed
Comments from POL stakeholders and return the Draft for further consideration and approval by POL.

Current Situation

2.2

The majority of accidents fall into three main categories lifting and handling,
stepping and striking and outdoor falls. These are higher frequency events with, in
the majority, relatively low severity. The lower frequency types of incident can carry
the potential for very high impact, for example, assaults and road traffic collisions.

Performance up to and including P8 for 2014/15 indicates that ‘all accidents’ are
tracking on target and are forecast to outturn on the 5% reduction target. Absence
accidents are tracking adverse to target and as a result of two relatively weak
periods are now unlikely to achieve target reduction at year end. However severity
of the accidents, measured by ‘days lost’, is currently well ahead of target and
forecast to outturn ahead of the 5% reduction target.

significantly from previous years and in line with the low number of accidents
that result in sick absence. Claims involving members of the public have also
reduced. Comparison with a similar retail organisation indicates that the Post
Office claim rate is significantly lower in both public and employer's liability and
of those claims the ‘denial’ or ‘defence’ rate is significantly more successful.

The total number of road traffic collisions (RTCs) up to and including P8 is up
35 on last year. The number of incidents where the Post Office driver is ‘at fault’
is showing an increase of 11 compared to last year. (Table 3 refers) Road risk
reduction opportunities continue to be the subject of analysis at the Road Risk
Forum with a view to identifying improvement activities in addition to those
already in place. (3.1 below) Reversing incidents remain a cause for concern
and have been the subject of specific improvement interventions. Injuries as a
result of road traffic collisions are extremely infrequent. Road traffic collisions
account for less than 3% of the overall number of injury accidents, however
they have the potential for high impact in terms of injury and loss. Currently the
majority of incidents involve low speed — less than 25mph — and relatively low
levels of damage.

down 1 on last year with 4 of the 23 robberies enabled by the presence and/or
threat of use of fire arms and on no occasions were the firearms discharged.
Support for those affected by robberies is provided by trained trauma
supporters and professional support resources available through the
occupational health service provision. Risk reduction activities are identified at
3.2. (Appendix 1 — Significant Incidents refers)

2.7 Robberies and attempted robberies on the Post Office network, up to and
including period 8, are up 4 on last year to 67 of which 55% were successful.
Injuries sustained during robberies are down from 12 to 10. Robberies take
place predominantly at sub post offices leaving Crown branches largely
unaffected. Supporting activities have been introduced to continue to mitigate
the robbery risk and are identified at 3.2. (Appendix 1 — Significant Incidents
refers).

3. Act

ies
3.1 Road Risk

Current longer term activities to mitigate road risk are:

¢ Road risk forum in place to scope and develop road risk reduction initiatives
and activities supported by the risk management division of our insurers

¢ Analysis and deployment of interventions for reversing incidents to mitigate the
increased incidence rates, including yard assessments and technical accident
reduction interventions on new vehicles e.g. Reversing aids to reduce accidents

¢ Analysis and evaluation of data including risk profiling to identify drivers who
need additional support and to determine further generic accident reduction
interventions

e Safe driver of the year award to encourage and reward responsible driving

e Weekly case conferences to ensure consistent approach to accident
investigation, follow up activity and sharing of good practice

e Programme of driving and road risk communications to raise awareness of
current and emerging risks

3.2 Robbery/Burglary Risk

Current activities to mitigate robbery and burglary risk are:

e Active liaison activities with the police to understand ‘at risk’ areas and to
deploy surveillance teams

e Increased use of ‘advertising’ on vehicles of new deterrent technologies e.g.
DNA taggant — a solution that contains a unique identifier that is released
automatically in the event of a robbery, spraying those involved and enabling
identification of the individuals involved in the robberies

e Trialling new point of transfer arrangements to reduce exposure at Post Office
counters - the majority of robberies take place at the point of transfer which in
Post Office’s is the counter where there is ready public access. The new
arrangements allow for the cross pavement protection box to be emptied / filled
in a secure location.

¢ Significant reduction in opportunities for duress type robberies linked to the
introduction of single person vehicles — single person vehicles eliminate the

opportunities for Supply Chain employee duress type incidents which
historically have been the most violent and likely to involve injury.

3.3 Health and Wellbeing
Healthcare interventions:

« Second programme of visits to Crown branches, Supply Chain units and Admin
offices to offer health checks using equipment that provides a wide range of
indicators on physical wellbeing. The anonymised data is used to develop
future health and wellbeing campaigns and target interventions.

e The programme of visits is supported by an online ‘Wellbeing Zone’ health
check tool as a ‘self- help’ option

e Ongoing campaign of communications to promote a range of different wellbeing
issues

¢ Wellbeing events to promote general health, exercise and dietary initiatives

¢ Mental health awareness workshops — absence occurrences related to mental
health conditions as a percentage of all absence occurrences at P8 are down
from a high in P5 of 18.62% to 13.05% in P8. Mental health conditions remain
as the single most common cause of sick absence days as a percentage of all
sick absence days at 27.21%.

3.4 Safety

The Post Office occupational health and safety management system (OHSMS)
is certified by external auditors to the standards required by British Standard
OHSAS 18001.

On 13 November 2014, the Sentencing Council opened its 14 week public
consultation on draft guidelines for corporate manslaughter and health

and safety offences. If implemented, the guidelines will mean that large
organisations convicted of corporate manslaughter may face increased fines of
up to £20 million with those convicted of fatal health and safety offences facing
fines of up to £10 million. Updates will follow in due course.

4. Residual Risks
4.1 Driving activities have the potential for high impact/loss and therefore remain as
a significant residual risk. However, the actions identified in 3.1 above are
aimed at mitigating that risk and improving performance.
5. Recommendation
The Board is asked to:
5.1 Note the overall safety performance

5.2 Note the risk reduction activities.
5.3 Note the residual risks
