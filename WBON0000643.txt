Accompanying Notes:

This flowchart fairly reflects at a high-level the process for accounting for Transaction Corrections on
Horizon. There may have been minor variations to this process flow over the years. Transaction
Corrections did not exist before 2005 and the process for Error Notices was different.

(1) A SPM can also view outstanding TCs at any time after logging onto Horizon.

(2) The SPM at this stage can still select to cancel the TC process and deal with them at a later time
(except when the branch is at the end of a Branch Trading Period).
