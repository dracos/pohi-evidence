Hi Enifome,

Given we’re quite tight on time can we go with the following agenda please? I think there’s a feeling there’s a lot to
cover on the first two items so can cover Boland in more detail if necessary next time?

e Cost
e Compensation
e AOB

Many thanks,

Jamie

Hiya Jamie - hope you had a good weekend.

According to diaries, it looks like Minister Hollinrake is next due to meet with Nick Read on Tuesday 30th

April, 10:00-10:30.

I’m currently collating the briefing from my end so wondered if there are any items that POL would like to be

included in the agenda?

I'd be grateful for a response by tomorrow please, if possible.
