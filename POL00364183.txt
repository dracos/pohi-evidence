If Gideon thinks they’re problematic please leave them out. We’ve got a lot of good material and I don’t want it
undermined by taking points that don’t really work. What time tomorrow is this due to be served? I’m in an
arbitration hearing all day but I could look at any disputed bits over lunch (1pm to 2pm) if that would help.

Thanks Andy. Agree with the approach. Nonetheless, I have highlighted a few of these which I think we should
not include - some of them seem a bit problematic to me. But subject to that, from my perspective this is good to

go.

All best

All

As per my discussion earlier today with Gideon, we have added more sections of the Judgment to the attached
statement. Our approach has been to include anything that we might rely on, unless plainly not relevant to the
application. The objective being to avoid any challenge on appeal that a point in the Judgment was not put to
Fraser on the application.

All comments welcomed.

Kind regards

Andy
