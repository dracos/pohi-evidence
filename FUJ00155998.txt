1 INTRODUCTION

As part of the ongoing Meetings between POL and Fujitsu, this ISMF provides the forum to
update, introduce and resolve matters under the IG Security Banner where applicable.

1.1 Previous Minutes

The previous minutes were reviewed and where applicable historical items were closed and
removed to the Closed action section No other corrections were made.

2 ISSUES FOR DISCUSSION
2.1 1S$027001 Compliance /Registration

HP stated that the monthly compliance reporting is progressing and that further macros have
been added to the spreadsheet to provide assurances both internally and to POL. To further
provide assurance, prior to issuing the compliance report ( monthly pack), HP reviews the Audit
Progress report against the compliance areas.

PH then raised a point around the Audit assessment and specifically Event Monitoring. It was
discussed that there are inconsistencies around the Audit Progress report and the Security
Project plan. Without this, assurances cannot be given to POL;

ACTION: PS to provide the different types of Events to be monitored

ACTION: PS to work with colleagues for a presentation to both RMGA and POL at tbc on the
19" Feb to look at events

Conference room to be booked
ACTION: HP to speak with BE/MK with regards inconsistencies with Project Plan

2.2 IG Monthly Report

No issues were reported in the December reporting pack. HP stated that the monthly reporting
pack will be continuously reviewed to provide assurances to POL.

SL asked about the Prosecution witness statement. PS stated that a full investigation happened
and the outcome was to change the Witness Statement, as the original Statement was not
providing the correct Legal witness content. As part of this, a full analysis is happening with
regards past queries.

PS also stated that the Root Cause analysis was around code bug.

This will further be explained once all information has been gathered In Next months Information
Pack.

2.3. Security Policy

After the Security policy had been amended, this was then provided to POL at the latter end of
December 08 for review and comment. PH provided these comments back to BP. It was decided
that due to the type of comments received, HP asked for a conference call to discuss the point
and to make sure that the comments were understood. Actions were taken away from the
meeting where by BP sent several emails off within Fujitsu. HP was under the impression that
the document had been returned to POL on the 15 Jan 09. But after conversation with BP by
phone, this was corrected. BP has to provide updated document and comments week beginning
26 Jan 09.

HP then discussed the idea of providing a high level Security Policy (Summary) for the RMGA
Users to read and accept rather than reading the full Policy. PH stated that as long as the
contractual Security Policy did not change then it appeared like a good idea for a high level

policy.

2.4 Service Description

As the document is up for approval, PH stated that there appeared to be a couple of
discrepancies around Document references to Horizon and not HNG-X

PS stated that the document has been sent out for approval.

2.5 ISMS Manual

No Information added on this months Forum

2.6 Risk Treatment Plan, ISMS Scope, Risk Assessment

There have been several concerns with regards the RTP and Risk Management Approach
process.

To this end POL have asked for a workshop to understand via a walk through process of how the
Risk Management approach works.

ACTION: BP to arrange Walkthrough meeting

With regards to the Off shoring piece of work, PH asked why the Risk treatment plan does not
show the off shore actions. HP stated that this will be put back in under closed.

ACTION: BP to put Offshore RTP back into spreadsheet as closed

2.7. Risk Management Approach

Although this document had been reviewed and amended certain areas of the document do not
align to the overall process. AS per 2.6 (Above) PH as requested a walkthrough of the process

2.8 HNG-x
ACTION: OUSTANDING: SL will be sending an email to HP/ BM / JS, and CM to find out what
risk methodology they're actually using to identify the risks.

Due to discussions, PH provided the following statement with regards the current Risk
methodology used within the Post Office.

The Royal Mail Group set the policy for Post Office in this area. The preferred tool is under
review but the front runner is one of the versions of CRAMM

2.9 Security improvement plan
HP asked if the Secure email had been resolved, as it was understood that Bill Membery had
provided DK the information for completion. SL stated that she would speak to DK for an update

ACTION 35: HP to discuss Secure Email issues with BM and DK. HP to confirm DK has emailed
Bill with update.

PH queried why a risk on the SIP was RED and the only one left (relates to Event Monitoring).
After the discussion around this, it was agreed that the risk should be downgraded to amber as it
is work in progress. This also relates to the ongoing work with Event Monitoring, which is to be
presented to the client on 19" February 2009

2.10 Incident Response Plan

It was stated that a meeting had been arranged for the 22" January in Bracknell to discuss the
Incident management process and its component flow charts (i.e. PCI). The main point of the
meeting is to clarify the one document against multiple process documents and to provide
actions to close off

A workshop will be held on 22" January to discuss and agree the final output.

2.11 PCI Progress

In lieu of the PCI Bi-monthly meetings, there have been a series of PCI Workshops to provide
support to POL in readiness to the up and coming Audit in April.

AOB
Q PCI Scans
The test will be scoped against the PCI standards for Pen Testing.
