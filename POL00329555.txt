Stephen Bradshaw materials (Joan Bailey).zip

Dear Solicitor to the Inquiry

We refer to our letter sent earlier today (attached), which enclosed a note prepared by Peters & Peters. In that note
Peters & Peters stated that the transcripts of three audio tapes related Stephen Bradshaw’s interview of Joan Francis
Boiley (sic Bailey) would be informally produced as soon as the transcriptions were complete.

Please find attached those three transcripts, as provided to us by Peters & Peters. We note our understanding, from
Peters & Peters, that the audio files were in places of low quality, which has affected the clarify of the transcription.

This material will be uploaded by way of formal production to the Inquiry’s Egress site in the week beginning 2

January 2024.

Yours faithfully

Herbert Smith Freehills LLP
