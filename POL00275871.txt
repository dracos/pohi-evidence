Watts, Alani

Lets do what works but we need to

1. Set out strategy for remaining Horizon trial and how we best influence the Judge not to go beyond

the expert witness remit

2. Approve the appeal grounds and meet the new QC

3. Propose an approach to settlement (timing, approach, team, remit, governance)
4, Outline potential good bank/bad bank decision

5. Share prep for KT meeting

Thanks Al

Hi Al

We are in the process of arranging the GLO Subcommittee for next Tuesday.

As the trial is being heard on that day, could you indicate if you are happy with it to be before Court or after Court on
the Tuesday. The trial will not be heard on the Wednesday but I understand that Tim prefers to do Tuesdays and we

are otherwise in an all day GE session.
Thoughts?

Kind regards
Ben
