Dear Sirs

The Post Office Group Litigation
Recusal Application

We refer to your third letter of today.

We do not agree that the witness statement fails to comply with the Order. If your client wishes to
contend at the hearing that any argument made by Post Office goes beyond the witness statement
and/or amounts to an “ambush”, that submission can be made. We do not propose to provide a further
statement.

Yours faithfully

omble Bank Lhe. (uk) LIP
