Update for 10 Nov Delivery Meeting

Issues:
(Criteria [Issue IActions [Responsibility
I. IAI 298/1 1.Pathway dispute whether the Blue Screens (possibly Energis To be agreed at Delivery Meeting)
witch fail) should be included (78) failures counted)
2. There is an inconsistency in the derivation of the statistics. The
1548 aggregated target figure does not include allowance for
lbackoffice PCs installed in outlets, whereas the monitored call
opulation doers include calls related to backoffice PC incidents
B. IAT376/4 [Analysis of incidents to date is not complete. Pathway to present review of all incidents in next 376 report dueIPathway John

5. IAI 408/3 IThe method of reporting is in dispute. POCL believe that these {To be agreed at Delivery Meeting)

b. IAT408/5 [The agreed method of measurement has not been followed and _ {To be agreed at Delivery Meeting)
