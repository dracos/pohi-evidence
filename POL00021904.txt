Attachments: DRAFT Letter to Second Sight re Part 2 Preliminary Comments 12082014.docx; Part Two - DRAFT.PDF

All,
Please find attached a revised draft response to Second Sight’s Part Two report following Belinda, Andy and I speaking to
them yesterday. I have also attached the Part Two report for ease. This needs to reach Second Sight tomorrow so 1
would be grateful for comments today/overnight which I will consolidate.
Mel — as well as your comments can you also get Brunswick’s and send through a consolidated return?
A few points to bear in mind:

The letter is a work in progress and we will continue to tighten the drafting overnight.

We will finalise who the signatory will be once we have finalised the content and tweak drafting accordingly.

¢ There will be a second stage of comment on the draft Second Sight report and it is at that stage we will senda
tougher letter if the draft does not significantly improve.

Many Thanks

David
