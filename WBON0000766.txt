Andy - I have been giving some thought to how we might 'sort' what JFSA calls the 'toxic' cases. So a couple of things firstly given
that this is about reaching a conclusion I wondered if we could use either an arbitrator or a mediator - both would be independent tho
paid by POL, they could even sit between POL and SS?

Secondly we know that Castleton is on the list can you get one of the BD team to do a summary of the facts and suggest what we can
do...?

Thanks

Susan
