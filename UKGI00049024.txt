Postmaster Survey Summary

Overview:

* This year’s annual Postmaster Engagement Survey an between the 8* - 315t
March 2024 and was our fourth annual survey.

+ 1,917 postmaster responses were received (+17% vs LY) and is the highest
completion rate since the annual survey started in 2021.

UKGI00049024
UKG100049024

Off the back of enhanced engagement initiatives, this year’s results evidence
improved metrics across both response rate and overall sentiment vs LY.

Methodology:

+ The survey was managed by ‘Quadrangle’, an independent market research

agency, who designed the questions following a large-scale piece of qualitative
research with postmasters, to understand what drives their overall opinion.

* We have consistently measured overall postmaster sentiment vidwo key
questions, both of which postmasters respond to on a 7point scale (1 being low,
7 being high).

+ Firstly, we ask how they woulddescribe the relationship they have with Post
Office and whether it is as a ‘subordinate business partner’ or a ‘valued/equal
business partner.’

* Secondly, we ask how supported they feel by Post Officewhether they feel

Postmaster Survey Key Takeaways

Our focused engagement initiatives have driven improved metrics, with better response rates and overall
sentiment compared to previous years. Increased interaction with postmasters is proving to have a positive effect on sentiment, with
accelerated activity to support greater engagement, especially with the involvement and visibility of senior leaders. Beyond our
accelerated engagement initiatives, the business has made substantial improvements across other critical areas including the Branch
Support Centre (BSC), training, field team support and quicker IT fix times, all contributing to the positive outcomes

Despite these achievements, many external factors have impacted our scores negatively, highlighting
the need for continued improvement. Key external events such as the cost-of-living crisis, Royal Mail strikes, cyber-attacks, and media
coverage (ITV drama and inquiry) have negatively impacted sentiment scores.

The sentiment scores have shown significant fluctuations over the past four years, influenced by both
Post Office actions and external factors. Despite some improvements, there has been increased polarisation with more postmasters
scoring at the extremes of the scale. (See next slide).

Satisfaction with remuneration is a critical driver of positive sentiment among PMs. Despite some
increases, remuneration remains the top priority and the area with the lowest perceived improvement.

The main themes for improvement identified are ‘leadership and culture’, ‘reputation and trust’, and
‘future strategy’. Continuous engagement initiatives and feedback loops are planned to address these areas and further improve
postmaster sentiment. Over the last 4 years we have increased the number of postmasters attending various listening groups and
forums from 23 to 589, to help address underlying issues and create solutions.

Over the last 5surveys, we have seen our relationship with Postmasters
fluctuate, with a greater polarisation of views more recently.

How would you describe the relationship you have with Post Office? How supported, or not, do you feel by Post Office?

There appears to be 2 main reasons for the polarisation of opinion:

1) Firstly, PUDO seems to have divided the network - those postmasters who have PUDO services seem to be happier and positive aboutthe future,
whereas those who don’t have the services are clearly aware of the services and the benefits that it brings but are frustrate that they cannot offer
them.

2)

Secondly, a culmination of the cost-of-living crisis, the ITV drama and inquiry, the various disclosures of bonus payments and the racial document
have increased negative sentiment considerably.

Built by Postmasters for Postmasters

Postmasters have provided us with useful feedback on why sentiment might be low,
and we are focusing on these key areas to drive action and improvement. From
postmaster listening groups over the last 18 months, we are seeing a positive reaction
to new approaches and therefore fully expect the underlying sentiment to improve.

The action plan for 2024 has been built in collaboration with 20 postmasters generating ideas
to improve against the key themes highlighted in the survey.

Although we have made annual increases to remuneration, with a commitment to increase
variable remuneration as a % of variable income, remuneration remains the top priority for
postmaster — it is spontaneously mentioned as the main improvement postmasters would like
to see and is the poorest performing of the top priority areas in terms of perceived
improvements.

We plan to continue to hold listening sessions, as well as other ongoing engagement initiatives,
ensuring a continuous feedback loop to ensure we understand postmaster’s concerns
throughout the year, such as Adopt an Area, Regional Forums, working groups and the
Postmaster Experience Forum.

The next Postmaster pulse survey is planned for October 2024.

Colleague Survey Headlines

86% overall completion rate, this is +21pts from the 2023 Pulse (65%) and +50%
from the 2022 Engagement Survey (36%).

Colleague engagement is down 11% to 57%.

This is driven by colleague pride being down 22% to 43%.

Colleagues are still more motivated to do their best at Post Office than employees in
other businesses.

58% of colleagues intend to stay longer than 5 years.

UKGI00049024
UKG100049024

Colleague Survey Key Takeaways

43% of comments from colleagues on improving their experience at Post Office related to
communications. Communications issues are undermining colleagues’ confidence in the business
and in senior leaders.

Colleagues are asking for a refreshed strategic intent beyond 2025 to be communicated.

Tech is less of a barrier for colleagues than it was previously, dropping by 17%, and colleagues’
experience of their Line Manager has improved in 6 of 7 measures.

SLP and Band 4 colleagues describe Post Office as ‘bureaucratic’ and ‘political’ and are the most
‘under strain’ at 81% and 77%. Compared to Admin colleagues who describe Post Office as ‘friendly’
and ‘supportive’ and only feel 34% under strain.

Colleagues with a disability are least likely to feel included at Post Office, diverse ethnic background
colleagues are less likely to be positive about career progression, and senior women are the most
likely group to have received an unwanted comment.
