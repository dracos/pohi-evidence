Charles, please see if there's a straightforward paragraph we can write on this (should go in my name) rather than giving
them the whole insurance paper.

Thanks,
Chris

Martin

I'm afraid the para on insurance does not answer the question which was about PI cover for the PO not D&O cover for
the directors.

The key question is does the PO have insurance cover in the event of a material claim (or perhaps a ‘class action’ type
claim)? Probably easiest if I pick up directly with Chris.

Regards

Alasdair

> Apologies all, it should have been this version of the note attached to yesterday's email, which incorporates the
insurance information (at paragraph 31) rather than leave that in a standalone note. It also includes a couple of additional
sentences on accounting arrangements at paragraph 24.

> For the benefit of the other Board members I had a very good review with Susan and Alwen earlier this week focused
mainly on the history and immediate actions we are taking to dealing with the urgent case review. I was reassured by the
energy, resource and prioritisation of the work we are doing and I think it's fair to say on this we are working through as
quickly as is practical.

>

> In our discussion with Susan, Alwen explained why the case review was only going back to 2010 and the significance of
a Horizon upgrade (full reconciliations across every site etc). Could Alwen please elaborate on this point as a critical
issue will be determining how far back we need to go.

verified) and have we taken any action (noting that they have offered to pay£100k in support of costs)?
