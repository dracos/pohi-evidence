2. Compensation principles

+ Limitation - claims over 6 years old are generally irrecoverable at law.
Should settlements be offered on old claims?

+ Causation —At law, SPMRs need to show that their complaints have
actually caused, or at least materially contributed to, the losses claimed.
This is more difficult for claims relating to, say, a lack of training and
support. Should Post Office insist on evidence of causation?

+ Remoteness - Peculiar or excessive losses that are unforeseeable to
POL may not recoverable at law. Should POL compensate these types
of losses?

+ Mitigation - At law, SPMRs are obliged to take reasonable steps to
reduce their losses (for example, minimising decline in retail business).
Should POL be looking for evidence of mitigation before offering a
settlement?

SPMR identifies a specific

have a clear or established
operating practice.

SPMR shows that they have
sought support and that the
support did not (1) solve the
issue and/or (2) POL failed to
follow its established practices.

standard training are not

identify special circumstances
that made training inadequate.

Issue is confined to the specific
circumstances of an SPMR so less
