Draft POCL/BA/ICL Heads of Terms

attach for your comments a discussion draft of the Non-Binding Heads of Terms
among POGL, BA and ICL, together with an index of the documents which have been
incorporated in the Heads of Terms. I also attach fur your information a copy of the
acceptance flowchart sent to me yesterday by Masons.

The Heads of Terms are based on the latest draft of the heads of terms sent to BA on
2nd December, 1998. I have moved the terms of the BA/POCL agreement to a separate
document and have not made any changes to that document. You will see rhat there are a
number of issues which POCL should revert on before the Heads of Terms are circulated
ourside POCL. 1 would stress that the attached document is for discussion purposes only and
that Jeff and I may have further amendments.

Please would you arrange for a copy of the agreed veto grounds for acceptance to be

e tome.

As discussed earlier this week, I will leave it you to circulate the attached document for
comment within POCL. I think it would be worthwhile to have a meeting to discuss the
Heads of Terms once you and the others have had a chance to review it.

Regards,

Paul Lam-Po-Tang )

c Benefit Payment Guarantees

[Before the payment guarantee provisions are re agreed, the new. acceptance
regime will need to be'settled.] :

1. BA will guarantee the following aggregate payments (the “Benefit Payment

Guarantees”) for CMS, PAS, BES and OBCS over the Horizon Platform:-
Year Aggregate Guaranteed Payment
2001/2 £78m
2002/3 i £80m
2003/4 £80m.
2004/5 “1 £80m
2005/6 £72m.

[The above figures are.based on the figures which BA provided to KPMG for the
purposes of the Corbett proposal.) [Attach Corbett figures.]

2. The Benefit Payment Guarantees for BES and OBCS are to be made to POCL *
and POCL is to give back to back guarantees to ICL Pathway.

3. The amounts for the Benefit Payment Guarantees have been prepared on the
basis of actual prices in the relevant year after taking into account any
discounts and then multiplying these adjusted prices by the expected volume ~
and by 75%. [The figures also assume that inflation will be less than 6%.)

{BA and POCL to confirm whether guarantees are to increase if inflation is
6% or more.)

4 The Benefit Payment Guarantees are dependent on the system remaining fully
functional in accordance with the Related Agreements.

{How will adjustments'be made?]

The Benefit Payment Guarantees will commence from the date on which
[national rollout of NR2 and [NR2+] has been successfully completed] OR
[there is full acceptance of all contracted functionality from Pathway.
“Contracted functionality” for this purpose means the full contracted .
functionality for all BA services under the contracts and the full contracted
functionality for all POCL services under the contracts excluding the Logistics
Feeder System.] .

{Once the Benefit Payment Guarantees have commenced, BA will pay
guarantees based on each card enabled post office with the contracted
functionality to which multi-benefit migration has been completed. If the delay
to completion of multi-benefit migration to any individual post office is solely
due to the default of BA any of its contractual responsibilities, then BA will pay
guarantees for that office as if that delay had not occurred. DSS payment
guarantees for an individual post office will be assessed on the basis of the
percentage of that post office's business in relation to the UK total of DSS/SSA
business. The relevant PIVOT (or replacement). data will be collected for the
Jast available complete year before full acceptance as defined in paragraph
C4(ii) above. POCL will make such DSS/SSA data readily available to ICL
Pathway and BA and such DSS/SSA data will be available within six months
after the relevant year end. Back to back guarantees by POCL for BES and
OBCS will also be made on the same basis. Whatever the circumstances the
maximum of the guarantees. payable in any year will not exceed the sums sct
out in paragraph C(1) above.]

POCL agrees to pay quarterly in advance (as a payment on account of the
actual sum duc in respect of the relevant quarter) that part of the Benefit
Payment Guarantees in respect of BES and OBCS. To the extent that BA does
not pay POCL in respect of such Benefit Payment Guarantees, ICL Pathway will ~
reimburse POCL for the amount paid by POCL to ICL Pathway in respect of such
unpaid BA amounts.

Non-Benefit Payment Guarantees

POCL will in addition guarantee the following aggregate payments (the “Non-
Benefit Payment Guarantees”) for all POCL services, including core business
(excluding BES and OBCS), banking business and new products, over the
Horizon Platform:-

Automated bears to the total volume of transactions at all post offices, in each
case as ascertained by reference to the latest PIVOT data for those post offices.
{9. Until the completion of national rollout of the POCL Infrastructure, the .

Non-Benefit Guarantee Payments will be calculated as follows:

(i) For each post office, there shall be calculated the percentage (the “Non-
Benefit Percentage”) which that post office’s annual total non-benefits
business (i.e. services other than BES and OBCS) over the Horizon
platform represents of the national total annual non-benefits business
for all post offices over the Horizon platform for the year ending 31st
March, 1999 as recorded on the PIVOT system at the end of that year.
For post offices where a full year's data is not available (including,
without limitation, because there are new post offices that were not
trading at the start of the year) the average value for post offices with
the same number of counter positions will be used.

Gi) For each calendar month, the monthly extent (the “Monthly
Proportion”) of completion of roll-out of the POCL Infrastructure will be
calculated by adding the Non-Benefit Percentages for all post offices at
which implementation of non-benefits services shall have been
completed before the start of that month. This will be 100% in months
after full completion of the roll out of POCL Infrastructure. °

(iii) For each year ending 31st March, the annual proportion (the “Annual
Proportion”) of roll out of the POCL Infrastructure will be-calculated by
adding the Monthly Proportion for each calendar month in that year and
dividing by 12. ‘This will be 100% in complete years after full
completion of roll out of the POCL Infrastructure.

(iv) The Non-Benefit Payment Guarantees that apply in each year ending
31st March after acceptance of NR2 will be calculated by multiplying the
Non-Benefit Guaranteed Payment for that year in paragraph D(1) (as
adjusted by paragraph D(7)) by the Annual Proportion for that year.)

(10. If the planned rate of roll out is not achieved solely as a result of POCL
contractual default and if POCL shall have failed to mitigate the consequences
of such default (including, without limitation, where one post office cannot be
automated on the due date because of a POCL contractual default, POCL
making another post office with the same volume of business available for
automation in its place) then the guarantees will be calculated as if the delay

caused by that default had not occurred.) .

multibenefit), PAS and On-line CAPS (emergency payments and stop notices)
[but excludés On-Line Enquiries (OLE) and Soft EVP].

[ICL Pathway’s view is that OLE is covered by CCN 124 and to be delivered

Agree.)

“NR2+” means modifications and enhancements of NR2 functionality [(other
than in respect of Acceptance Incidents relating to NR2)], Soft EVR AP Smart
and support of PSTN connected Post Offices.
{The parties acknowledge that there is no Acceptance of NR2+ in the same way
as NR2 because the consequence of any particular facility in NR2+-not passing
through Release Authorisation is that.it will simply not be put into service.)
{What is meant by “contracted functionality"? Is it the same as NR2?)
“Single Benefit Live Trial Period” means, in respect of NR2, the period

ii) the payment guarantees in respect of non-benefit services will
commence in accordance with paragraph D of this document.

Once Release Authorisation for NR2 hasbeen given, full national rollout of NR2
shall commence. Acceptance is not equivalent to Release Authorisation. °

SCHEDULE 3

AMENDMENTS TO CONTRACTS TO FACILITATE BORROWING

{This schedule is primarily based on the POCL funding paper Gwhich has not been wholly
agreed by ICL) with reference to the second ICL funding paper in respect of compensation on
termination.]

2.2

Conditions

The changes in this schedule will not come into operation until the Pathway
system has been fully accepted, National Rollout [check definition used in the
acceptance schedule] has taken place successfully and financing has been
successfully raised.

Termination by the Authority

Termination by the Authority will be as set out in the Related Agreements.
However, the parties will review and seek to agree: .

(i), changes to the trigger events for termination (to add materiality); and
ii) what constitutes serious or persistent breaches of service levels.

[This process should, if possible, be finalised before this document is settled.
ICL Pathway to revert on proposed changes.]

“Force Majeure” is to be defined by strict reference to the draft Treasury
Guidelines, which define Force Majeure as:

e War, civil war, armed conflict or terrorist attack affecting the United
Kingdom; or

. Nuclear, chemical or biological contamination; or

. the effect of pressure waves caused by devices travelling at supersonic
speeds.

Force Majeure conditions would only apply if the above events occurred and
resulted directly in ICL Pathway being unable to perform its contractual
obligations. In such circumstances, ICL Pathway would mitigate any loss
suffered and not claim relief from liability unless the effect of Force Majeure
events prevented ICL Pathway from being materially able to comply with its

Compensation on Termination

[The following changes are based on ICL Pathway’s proposal which BA and
POCL are yet to accept but are included for discussion purposes.]

For clarification, this section addresses the circumstances in which
compensation payments are made to ICL Pathway (or the lenders) from either
the Authority or Fujitsu. Provisions regarding compensation payments from ICL
Pathway to the Authority shall remain as stated in the Related Agreements
(subject to resolution of commercial issues, including the adequacy of the
current limit on IC's or ICL Pathway’s liability given the increased scope and
duration of the Related Agreements).

The provisions on compensation payments set out below are subject to a
specific, detailed financing plan being agreed with ICL Pathway and arranged
by lenders. It is also subject to Pathway agreeing to mitigate any loss suffered.

{ICL Pathway to provide financing plan.]

The following definitions in the proposed compensation payment regime will
apply:

“Lender Liability” means third party limited recourse financing to the extent
that the aggregate does not exceed £[ @];

“Equity”. means ICL equity or loan stock and third party equity raised to the
extent that the aggregate does not exceed £[ @ J;

“Return on the Equity” means £[ @ };
[For refresh costs, see paragraph B of this document.]

(i) Voluntary Termination and Termination on Authority Default
{If there is voluntary termination by the Authority or termination on
Authority Default, then the compensation paid to ICL Pathway should be
the aggregate of Lender Liability (to the extent raised), Equity and
Rerum on the Equity, together with breakage costs of any funding and
hedging agreements of ICL Pathway relating to the Lender Liability.]

(ii) I Compensation on Pathway Default

(if the Authority terminates the Related Agreements for Default by ICL
Pathway, then a comparison (the “Value Test”) of the costs of replacing

the Pathway system against the costs of rectifying/repairing the Pathway
system will be carried out. ~

If it is cheaper to repair rather than replace, then ICL Pathway shall
transfer to the Authority [(or to’ its order)] the assets comprising the
system (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not only include the
physical assets but also IPR, licences and any other contracts or
information required to operate the Pathway system).

If it is not cheaper to repair than replace, then the Authority shall have
the option to require ICL Pathway to transfer the assets (as defined
above) to the Authority.

The Authority shall pay to ICL Pathway in return for the assets an
amount (the “Asset Price”) which reflects the expected future cashflows
of the Project less the costs of the Authority to continue with the Project
under the terms of the Related Agreements. This is without prejudice to
any other claims and liabilities arising as a result of the termination.

The application of the Value Test and the method of calculating the Asset
Price will be determined in accordance with the Annex to this
Schedule.]

iii) Termination on Force Majeure

{Where termination is as a result of Force Majeure then the Authority

shall be obliged to purchase the assets (which for the avoidance of doubt
@ B shall include not only the physical assets, but also IPR, licences and any

other contracts or information required to operate the Pathway system)

and the Authority shall pay to Pathway in return for the assets an

amount equivalent to the market value of the assets to POCL. OR [use

Value Test and Asset Price as above]}

5.3 Payment of the Asset Price to Pathway shall be made netof any set-off in
respect of any claim whatsoever. .

upon partial termination.

Tf an Authority's Default precludes ICL Pathway from fulfilling an obligation
under the relevant Related Agreement, ICL Pathway will be provided with
additional time to perform that obligation (provided causality between the
Authority’s Default and ICL Pathway’s failure to perform can be proven) and
will be paid the higher of the guaranteed payments and transaction payments
based on the actual number of transactions during the continuation of the effect
of the Authority’s Default.

7. Direct Agreement and Lenders’ Security
POCL accepts in principle the request for a Direct Agreement (im a form
satisfactory to the Authority), which would allow lenders:

(i) to step-in and undertake ICL Pathway's obligations under the Related
Agreements (provided they remain.within the existing timescale for
remedy);

(ii) to appoint a substitute entity to replace ICL Pathway (provided they
remain within the existing timescale for remedy and the Authority
consents to such appointment (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld)); and

(iii) to take security under the Agreement. Such security shall be limited to
ICL Pathway’s assignable rights and benefits under the Related
Agreements, and shall not include any other assets.

8. Corrupt Gifts

8.1 Subject to any applicable statutory requirements (including, without limitation,
the Prevention of Corruption Act 1889-1916), if an employee or sub-contractor
provides a-corrupt gift (which shall be of a material amount) without any
connivance by ICL Pathway, ICL Pathway shall be allowed 30 days to [terminate
the contract of the employee or sub-contractor] OR [remedy the corruption],
and if it is not remedied within that time frame, the Authority may terminate
the Agreement.

8.2 Lin the event of corporate corruption i.e. corruption involving the board of ICL I ©
Pathway, the Authority may terminate the Agreement without a 30 day.cure
period.)

RESOLUTION OF OUTSTANDING DISPUTES

Unbundling/Transaction Metrics

The transaction metrics are to be defined in accordance with the.Annex to this
Schedule. In return, Pathway is to be granted’a further price increase which
equates to a £35 million NPV on the volumes assumed in the Corbett
discussions (but, for the avoidance of doubt, has a greater value if actual
volumes are greater). This price increase is to be achieved by increasing the
Servicepoints for the Counter Terminal column of the Scorecard by 1.1, giving a
new figure of 6.7.

[Attach copy of letter dated 21st December, 1998 to D. Murphy of Societe
Generale from K. Baines of POCL?J . .

Modifications .

Pathway will meet the first £37 million of the cost of modifications (inclusive of
the’ cost of providing flat screens in non-Crown offices and inclusive of the
contribution referred to below). POCL will meet the next £6 million. Pathway
will meet any remaining costs. ‘ :

Pathway agrees to cover the costs of any additional modifications needed to
accommodate PIN pads, on the public side of the counter, for post offices in’
which surveys are carried out after the date agrecd for installing PIN pads.

‘The costs of Pathway out of hours working-where required are to be.agreed.
The reasonable costs of maintaining power supply at National Lottery node Post
Offices are to be borne by Pathway. ,

As acontribution to modifications POCL will pay £5 million on a phased basis

as modifications are carried out at a unit rate to be agreed over the total period
of the modifications. .

It is acknowledged by the parties that they intend to manage modifications with
a view to minimising all the costs thereof.

Training

Pathway has agreed to provide further training in accordance with CCN 286(b)

or an alternative method of providing additional training costing Pathway no
more than CCN 286(b).

. ANNEX TO SCHEDULE 4

Ao

TRANSACTION METRICS FOR CHARGES

It is proposed that transactions should be courted for charging purposes according to
the following rules. The default is that 1 customer-facing transaction in reference data
= 1 chargeable transaction. The following are the main exceptions:

Transaction items: 1 chargeable transaction per transcash item. For the avoidance of
doubt, there will be no chargeable transaction associated with the fee payable on the
transcash item. -

Postal orders: 1 chargeable transaction per customer session, regardless of number of
postal orders sold. For the avoidance of doubt, there will be no chargeable transaction
associated with the fee(s) payable on the postal order(s). Where postal stamps are
sold to make up the odd amount of a postal order value (e.g. the 27p of a postal order
of value £35.27), these stamps will be counted as a chargeable transaction in
accordance with the metrics for postal stamps (see below).

Phone cards: Sales of phone cards to be rolled up within a customer session, according
to value to determine chargeable transactions. For example, if a customer busy 2x
£2.00 cards this would be 1 chargeable transaction, however if the customer buys 1x
£2.00 and 1 x £5.00 cards this would be 2 chargeable transactions.

Saving stamps: 1 chargeable transaction per client, per customer session regardless of
the quantity and combination of saving stamp values sold. For example, if a customer
buys 1 x £2.00 and 2 x £5.00 British Gas saving stamps and 2 x £2.00 BBC licence
stamps this would result in 2 chargeable transactions.

Postage stamps: Sales of postage stamps within a customer session to be rolled up into
1 chargeable transaction regardless of quantity and combinations of stamps sold. For -
the avoidance of doubt, postage stamps includes definitive and special issue stamps of
all values, stamp books, and postage-paid stationery. It does not include other postal
products such as datapost or special delivery. For example, if a customer buys 2 x 1st
class, 42p of other postage, 3 x stamp book (10 x 2nd class) and a book of 10 x 1st”
class stamps, this would be 1 chargeable transaction.

Because it is recognised that the volumes of postage stamp sales in the Workload Brief
js subject to statistical uncertainty in deriving the average value of transactions, the
charges will if necessary be adjusted retrospectively as follows:

© The actual average value of stamp sales per transaction will be calculated by
dividing the total value of stamp sales recorded on Horizon by the number of
customer sessions in which stamp sales were recorded.

© The intended average value of stamp sales will be calculated as £2.51 multiplied by
the average RPI for the relevant invoicing year and divided by the RPI for the year’
ending February 1996. uC

© The adjusted amount payable for postage stamp sale transactions will be calculated
by multiplying the charges by the actual average value and dividing by the intended
average value, any under or over payment will be included as an adjustment to the

* ‘next monthly invoice.

© This adjustment will be calculated annually during the roll-out, and a final
adjustment factor, to apply in all subsequent years, will be calculated-at the end of
the first full invoicing year following completion of roll-out.

Retail items sold over the post office counter: Charged as 1 transaction per line, i.e. 1
item of each of 2 different lines = 2 transactions, 2 of the same line = 1 transaction.

Entry of sales not transacted through Horizon: i.e. postshop, vending, lottery etc.
Charged as 1 transaction per-batch entry for each product (e.g. 60 lottery ticket sales
and 60 vending items = 2 transactions).

Reversals: Where transactions are subsequently reversed, the transaction itself will be
chargeable as usual, but the reversal will not be chargeable, but any related fresh
transaction will be chargeable. ”
Use of scales: Each price look-up for postage items using the scales link or by manually
keyed input will incur a transaction charge for the EPOS Scales transaction in the Day
1 scorecard (scoring under Terminal, EPOS, Scales, SIS batch and no other columns)
(—) unless the counter clerk aborts the transaction without proceeding to a subsequent
stamp sale transaction. These scales transactions will only be initiated by the clerk
_selecting them from the screen or keyboard, anid will not be initiated by customers ~
placing items on the scales without clerk intervention.

Premium Mails Services: Each item requiring separate entry will count as 1 transaction
(e.g. posting 3 datapost packages which require separate recording). Where items are
entered as multiples (e.g. posting 2 parcels of the same weight with recorded delivery
to the same zone) these will count as a single transaction.

Scales, premium services, and postal order transactions are additional to any related
sale of postage stamps, but no more than 1 postage stamp sale will be recorded per
customer session regardless of the use of those stamps.
