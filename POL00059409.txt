Dear Sirs

Re: Regina (Post Office Ltd) v. Khayyam Ishaq
Bradford Crown Court
Date of next hearing: 25 February 2013 for Trial

Thank you for your letter dated 1st November 2012. We look forward to receiving a
revised defence case statement which particularises the issues, if any, you may have with
the Horizon system, as indicated by HHJ Rose at the PCMH on 4th September 2012. We
will then gladly review our disclosure obligations accordingly.

We appreciate that you received the core data covering the operational period of the
indictment on the 26% October 2012 in the form of a disc and accompanying password and
look forward to receiving your expert report from the forensic accountant as soon as
possible.

Should you require any assistance, please do not hesitate to contact Rachael Panter at the
above office on!” "GRO

Yours faithfully

Cartwright King
