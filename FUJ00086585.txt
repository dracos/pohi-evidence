showing

jas a £12686.14 surplus.

ate:17-May-2000 13:27:00 User:Steve Warwick
IF) Response =

jtooking at the message store it seems that Stock Unit DD has failed to
alance properly. The rollover records for the stock unit on 27th April

include only records for Cash, Stamps (Product 21) and Discrepancies (Product

145). These records are present only because they were the values of the

Jdeclarations used prior to balancing, all other stock, receipts and payments

alues are missing from the rollover records. At the time of declaration,
the values declared for Cash and Stamps were converted to discrepancies,
resumably because the system had failed to accumulate any current stock
jolding for either product.

jthe call needs to be looked at in detail by the EPOSS team in order to

jestablish why the system appears to have failed to locate any transactions

for this stock unit in CAP 5.

fter my first run through, the StockBalancing process has worked
uccessfully as of 27-Apr-2000. BEFORE PASSING THIS BACK WITH THE EVENT LOG,
MAY I REQUEST THAT THE MESSAGESTORE FOR NODE 1 IS RETRIEVED DIRECTLY FROM IT.
IT suspect there is a serious problem (Ripostewise??) with this as opposed to
the correspondance view of it.

jt shall still continue looking at subsequent weeks to see why the situation
never recovered itself.

[this is another instance of PC0038631 where Dataserver trees have failed to
build. This has now been fixed in CI4 and in conjuction with CP2587 (where
ithe data tree rebuild is minimised to 2 attempts instead of 4) should return
jan abort right back up to the user to retry the balancing process. Instances
where this can potentially occur is for example if the Riposte service has
jstoped/failed/unable to complete an IO request issed etc.
