1.0 Introduction

The Horizon system generates significant amounts of data that is of interest to Internal Audit and other
groups. The Horizon System Audit Manual [2], and the supporting Audit Data Catalogues [4-8]
provide further information on the structure, form and content of this data, referred to in this document
as ‘audit data’.

Subject to certain constraints the audit data must be made available to CGIA or other authorised
groups within time scales established in the Audit Data Retrieval Requirements (CSR+) [3] and the
Network Banking Internal Audit Requirements [10].

This document establishes the process for requesting audit data extractions and subsequent activities
undertaken to locate, retrieve, extract & filter and prepare for despatch on behalf of authorised
requesters.

2.0 Scope

Should future releases of Horizon bring about changes to the way that data is extracted this process
will be updated to reflect those changes.

This process applies to ALL audit data extraction requests from outside Pathway. Requests for audit
data extraction from within Pathway will also be subject to this process although use of the Request
For Information (RFI) form is optional.

3.0 Terminology
Within this process certain terms are used which have specific meaning within the Horizon Audit
Solution. They are:

Gatherer :

Sealer :

Hoarder :

Retriever :

Extractor :

Legato :

The module responsible for collecting the audit files from the hosts, agents, correspondence
servers and interface mechanisms. This module is also responsible for the application of the
audit file naming policy.

The module responsible for calculating the checksum seal of each audit data file before it is
written to DLT (tape) by the Hoarder. This value is recalculated by the Retriever and
compared to the original value when first sealed. Used to ensure data integrity during
storage on DLT.

The module responsible for writing audit data files onto DLT at pre-defined intervals.

The module responsible for retrieving audit data from the buffer file where it is placed by
Legato when requested by the Audit Workstation.

Retriever brings back complete files or groups of files from the DLTs. Further work may
be required to filter out unwanted information, especially true of the TMS files, using a
number of tools available on the Audit Workstation.

Legato Networker is the storage management application selected by Pathway to store and
manage audit data onto DLTs.

A more complete explanation of these modules can be found in [2].

4.0 Audit Data Integrity

The integrity of audit data must be guaranteed at all times from its origination, storage and retrieval to
subsequent despatch to the requester. Controls have been established to provide assurances to
Consignia Group Internal Audit that this integrity is maintained.

During audit data extractions the following controls apply:

a Extractions can only be made through the three Audit Workstations, which exist at Feltham and the
2 Data Centres, These are all subject to rigorous physical security controls appropriate to that
location. Specifically, the Feltham AW — where most extractions will take place — is located in a
secure room subject to proximity pass access within a secured Fujitsu Services site.

Q_ Logical access to the AW and its functionality is controlled by dedicated Logins, password control
and utilises the NT and Pathway security features defined in the overall Horizon security policy.

Q All extractions are logged on the Audit System and supported by documented RFIs, authorised by
nominated persons within CGIA. This log can be scrutinised on the AW.

Qa Extractions will only be made by individuals previously notified to CGIA. Currently this is limited
to Pathway Audit and Pathway CS Security personnel. Any additions will be notified to CGIA.

Q Agreement has been reached with CGIA regarding their rights to witness extractions without
warning or to request repeat extractions that they can witness.

Q Checksum seals are calculated for audit data files when they are written to DLT and re-calculated
when the files are retrieved.

Fujitsu Services AUDIT DATA EXTRACTION PROCESS Ref: TA/PRO/004
Version: 1.0

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 29/05/02

6.0 Overview
The process assumes that audit data has been Gathered, Sealed and Hoarded onto DLTs by the Audit
Archive Server. The five main types of files are :

a. Flattened and compressed TMS Journals from the Correspondence Servers.
b. Flattened Oracle tables output from regular OBCS database purging cycles.
c. Transaction files to and from PO systems and their associated FTMS control files.

d. AP Client Files
e. Tivoli Event files
All file types are referenced in the audit catalogues [4-8]

The process is invoked through the receipt of an RFI into Pathway CS Security. Expressed in business
terms, the RFI must be interpreted into its component Audit Points and Sub-points. This then enables
specific files to be identified which, through the Legato index, targets a specific DLT. Data is retrieved
by the Audit Retriever, formatted as appropriate and then further Extracted against the RFI criteria.
Depending on the extraction method the data can be extracted to standard MSOffice products before
being placed onto CD-W or floppy disc for despatch to the RFI originator.

The following paragraphs present an overview of each step in the extraction process and are ordered to
reflect the actual processing of a Request For Information (RFI) by Pathway CS Security.

6.1 Request For Information

All CGIA requests for audit data must be made via the Request For Information form. This will contain
a description, in business terms, of the times, outlets, events, items activities and required Excel
reporting format that the Auditors are interested in. This request has to be interpreted by Pathway CS
Security and mapped onto the Audit Points and Files described later in this document.

Internal requests (e.g. from Pathway investigations personnel) will typically be in the form of a PinICL
on the ‘Dataextraction’ stack for CS Security.

6.2 Marking Files and Tapes

Based on this interpretation as many files of audit data that are needed to satisfy the request are
‘marked’ for retrieval. Legato is notified of these files and it in turn identifies the DLTs containing
these files. Legato provides system prompts for Operators to load tapes and it copies the data into a
local buffer area.

6.3 Audit Track Retriever

Polls the Legato buffer area and retrieves any data files found into temporary disk on the Archive
Server prior to the extraction of relevant data for use by the auditors. The Retriever provides a second
copy of the file which is input to the Check Seal function.

Version: 1.0

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 29/05/02

6.4 Audit Data Check Seal

To assure the integrity of the audit data while on the DLT the checksum seal for the file is re-calculated
by the Audit Track Sealer and compared to the original value calculated when the file was originally
written to the DLT. The result is maintained in a Check Seal Table.

6.5 Audit Trail Extractor

This is a facility that uses various tools to extract or reform the retrieved audit data in accordance with
the RFI. It also places the information onto a CD-W, or other suitable media, for despatch to the RFI
originator.

Version: 1.0

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 29/05/02

7.0 Retrieving & Extracting Audit Data
7.1 Receiving the RFI

a) All CGIA requests for audit data extractions must come to Pathway CS Security in the form of a
Request For Information. An example of this form can be found at Annex A. The RFI may be mailed,
faxed or e-mailed to Pathway.

RFIs will only be accepted from the following named individual :

Graham Ward : CG Internal Audit

or one named delegate, to be confirmed in writing by CGIA Internal Audit.

If other parts of the Post Office, or other organisations, require audit data extractions they must be
channelled through CGIA to Pathway CS Security at Feltham.

Contractual turnaround times for the provision of data apply.

b) Internal requests will be in the form of a PinICL, allowing the requestor’s identity to be verified.
Requestors should state what media is acceptable (e.g. CD-W, email of WinZipped file up to 500kB)
The despatching of confidential data is bound by Fujitsu Services policy. For TMS files - also referred
to as “message store” or “Correspondence Server”- they should also specify the output file format(s):
text, MS-Excel or MS-Access. (See Section 8 for more information).

CGIA and Internal requests are recorded on the Data Extraction Spreadsheet. They should be
logged to record the following information: Request id (e.g. PINICL no. or RFI no.), the date the
request was received, the urgency of the request, the FAD and date range to search. Turnaround times
are agreed rather than covered by contract.

7.2 Interpreting the RFI

It is necessary to interpret the RFI by identifying the audit points and sub points that generated the
records that are required and, through the Audit Data Catalogues [4-8], the files produced at those
audit points and sub points.

7.3 Login Audit Workstation

Carry out following procedure to Login and obtain necessary shares

1. Login 1 Beer HH
2. Password  : ***#####*
3. Domain: PWYDCS

At this point the SecurelD Authentication is invoked. See [9].

Carry out the following procedure to authenticate yourself as an authorised user

{L. Enter passcode :<personal 6 digit PIN and 6 digit SecureID token display> ]
The AW will present a blank desktop with a START icon in the bottom left of the screen. Using pull
up <Programs> will reveal the extent of products available for any subsequent extraction work.

7.4 Preliminary Housekeeping
It is highly likely that an average RFI will need a significant number of files to satisfy it. To avoid the
AW filestore becoming clogged with hundreds of files it is strongly recommended that a working
directory is established on the AW to hold all files relevant to a particular RFI :
1. Select <Windows_NT_Explorer> from the drop down menu.

2. Set up <New Folder> as D:\audit data\RFI Reference No.

7.5 Cluster Determinant

Note that this step is only required if (a) TMS files are involved and (b) the Legato User Interface is

being used.
It is recommended that this step is carried out BEFORE entering the Retrieval GUI.

Access the Secure Id Admin workstation and use Tivoli Event Console which links in to the oracle
database, to identify the cluster id of a particular FAD.

7.6 Targeting the Data Files

At this stage of the retrieval procedure the AWO can choose to use the Pathway Legato User Interface
(Para 7.7), a Pathway developed intelligent front end, or the standard Legato User Interface (Para 7.8).
While there are no hard and fast rule around which interface to use the PLUI has obvious benefits when
attempting to identify and mark a large number of files for retrieval.

Note that if you are using the standard Legato User Interface it is still necessary to register the RFI on
the RFI database.

It is highly unlikely that a single file will hold the information required by the RFI. Indeed, the broader

the date spread or complexity of request the greater the number of files that will have to be retrieved
from DLT.

7.8 Using the Standard Legato User Interface
The RFI must be registered on the RFI database before commencing the retrieval activity.
1. Select <Audit ExtractorClient.CMD> from the main program menu.

2. At dialogue SELECT DATA CENTRE select <Data Centre> required.
3. At dialogue AUDIT EXTRACTOR select <Request> from title menu.

4. Select <New> if new RFI

more than I hoarding instance then they have to be retrieved on a hoard instance basis. For example, if
3 hoarding instances happened in a day and all 3 contained files of interest to a particular RFI there
would have to be 3 separate retrieval runs.

1. Select <Legato_Client_Bootle.CMD> from main program menu

2. Select <Directed Recovery> from <Operations> drop down menu
3. Confirm <mboarc01> as Source Client in dialogue. <OK>
4. Confirm <mboarc01I> as Destination Client dialogue. <OK>
ote that Bootle is assumed as the primary retrieval location. There is no difference in the
laudit data held at each Data Centre. If Wigan is selected then the <Legato Client Wigan
ICMD> should be selected and <mwiarc01> used to confirm Source and Destination dialogues.
5. Select <Change Browse Time> from View drop down menu
6. Select appropriate date button
7. Select appropriate Hoard time (note 7:30p)
8. Locate files through Legato directory structure and naming convention [3]
9. <Mark> files using <“> button on toolbar
10. Select <Recover Options> from Options drop down menu

11. Enter d:\Archiveserver\INTERFACES\RESTORED._AT into dialogue box

12. Select <traffic lights> button on toolbar

Note: The ‘View Versions’ facility on the Legato User Interface can be used to identify when
hoardings took place.

7.9 Targeting the DLTs
Most Retrievals will be made from the TMS18Mnth, NonTMS18Mnth and NON TMS7Yr tape pools.

In order to achieve next day loading ISD must be notified before 1200hrs, using the OCP form. See
annexe 2 for a template OCP form. The following fields must be filled in and then emailed to ISD;
1. Requested by — requesters name

2. Date raised — today’s date
3. System id —mwiarc01/mboarc01
4. Requested tape serial number — must be TMS number followed by tape serial number.

ls. Date required —

6. Required until — (this is not mandatory)

[7._ The reason for tape load — to satisfy Pathway internal audit (PO/RET#/00)

Note: The ‘View Versions’ facility on the Legato User Interface can be used to identify whether the
DLTs containing the data are in place.

For example, following the directory tree down as far as the ‘TMS Pool’ branch will show an entry
“TMS”. Highlighting this enables “View Versions’ to be used.

7.10 Reformatting Retrieved Data

Before detailed extractions can take place using R-Query, Wordpad, Discoverer or other appropriate
tools it is necessary to ‘re-format’ the retrieved data into a format suitable for access. There are three
options :

a. TMS Re-formatter to rebuild a pseudo Correspondence Server.
b. Winzip for flat files that were zipped prior to Hoarding.
c. Oracle Table Re-formatter to rebuild Oracle tables.

7.10.1 Reformatting TMS Journals

Once the TMS Archive files have been deposited in EXTRACTED_AT they must be ‘built’ into a
pseudo Correspondence Server for R-Query to access. Further filtering is available to restrict the
number of Outlet records that are included in the re-build activity based on the original RFI.

The utility is evoked with the use of the Pathway Audit Extractor GUI
1. Select <Audit Extractor Client> from the programs menu

2. Select <Message store>, <Reset Message Store>
When it has reset successfull
3. Select <Message store>, <Generate Message Store>

4. Enter start date for messages

[End date for messages

PO FAD

{5. Generate Message Store ]

Unzipping Zipped Flat Files
It is strongly recommended that files to be unzipped are transferred from the AS to the AW in their

zipped state and unzipped on the AW. This can produce space savings of the order of 90%.
1. Select <Winzip.CMD> from main program Menu.

2. Select <Open> and identify zipped file through dialogue screen.

7.11 Checking the Seals

This step is only required if the Legato User Interface is being used. There is a File Status button on
the Pathway Legato User Interface

When using the Legato user interface to recover a file from DLT a copy is made and subjected to a re-
calculation of the integrity seal. This value is compared to the original value on the Seal Database and

7.12 Despatch of Audit Data

Despatch of the extract data is by the most appropriate means depending on the nature and volume of
the extracted data, and subject to any special requests made on the RFI.

The Audit Data Extraction Spreadsheet must be updated to record the date that the extraction activity
was completed.

The media is despatched to the CGIA contact using Royal Mail Special Delivery. This ensures that a
receipt is provided to Pathway confirming delivery.

For internal requests, it will usually be convenient to email the extracted data file to the recipient,
although in the case of large files (>100kB) this is ideally done at the end of the working day. The
alternative is to arrange despatch/collection with the recipient.

8.0 Introduction to R-Query

R-Query is an interrogation tool used to extract data from a Correspondence Server. It has powerful
SQL type features which are used to define the extraction scenarios and the ability to output the results
to standard MS-Office utilities.

It is a vital element in the Audit Workstation tool set and requires that a Correspondence Server exists
on one of the Audit Servers. Details on how to achieve this pre-requisite can be found earlier in this
procedure.

Enter the required Post Office (FAD) code into the <Group ID:> field if it is not shown.

Once this has been done an intermediate screen will be displayed, allowing the file format to be
confirmed — select the <Excel> or <Access> buttons or the “text” icon, as appropriate to commence
loading the package and complete the data transfer. This will also allow the data format to be checked
on-screen.

Note: In the case of very large Correspondence Server files spanning a number of days, an error may
be generated on trying to save an Excel file. This will be because the maximum number of rows
(records) has been exceeded. Should this occur, the range of dates should be covered, say one or two
days at a time, and a number of output files generated.

In rare cases it will theoretically be possible to produce a text output file that is too big to be read by
Wordpad. Should this occur, a possible response is to produce output files for a smaller range of dates,
or to initially create data as an Excel working file which you can ‘Save As’ “Text, OS/2 or MS-DOS”.

It is good practice to check that all output files can be opened before they are copied to floppy disk or
CD-W for onward transmission.

9.0 Failed TMS Tape Procedure Pre Cloning

This section specifies the action to be taken in the event of a TMS Audit Trail tape becoming
unreadable. Prior to the commencement of the retention of a clone copy at each site in October 2001.

The process will ensure that the TMS audit trail at the alternate site to that of the failing tape has a
resilient copy taken in order to maintain two copies of the Audit Trail.

9.1 Step 1 — Create a new document to record details

This initial step handles the creation of a Word document to record the details of the failing tape, and
later capture details of the Cloning required.

Create a new Word document from the template TMS tape fail. See Annexe C.

Record the tape details in Table 1

9.2 Step 2 — Record data content of the failing tape.

This step records the details of the savesets held on the failing tape and thus identifies the data that
cannot be accessed.

From Networker Administrator select the Volumes Tab and locate the failed tape.

Double-click on the failed tape and record the details in Table 2

Note: record the date in American format as held by Legato

Do not record savesets marked as RECYC

9.3 Step 3 — Record savesets encompassing period at alternate
site

This step records details from the audit archive at the ALTERNATE site to the failing tape of savesets

which span the period of data held on the failing tape.

From Networker Administrator select the alternate Audit server from the Indexes tab

Select the Index for the server (i.e. server name) double click. Takes a few mins.

From the index list select D:\Archiveserver\Hoarded_AT\TapepoolBackup\TMS_Pool and press the
<Details> button.

From the list of savesets record those required which cover the period with an overlap of one day each
side. in columns 1-4 of Table 3

9.4 Step 4- Record Volume Details for the savesets

This step records volume details for the savesets identified in the previous step.

From Networker Administrator select the volumes Tab and search through the volumes for the
savesets recorded in table 3.

Care must be taken where the flag is “h’ as there will be a continuation volume to be found

9.5 Step 5 —Determine clone tapes required & Volumes to be
loaded

This step calculates the data volume which requires cloning and thus gives the new volumes required to
hold the cloned data. It also provides a tape loading list.

Total the data sizes in Table 3 (in Gigabytes) and divide by 70 to determine the number of Clone tapes
that will be required.

Complete Table 4 with the details, and record the TMS Volumes / barcodes for loading to complete the

cloning operation. The barcode details can be obtained from the Volumes tab in Networker
Administrator

9.6 Step 6— Complete a Clone list by Volume
This step records details of the savesets to be cloned BY VOLUME as this will be required when
producing the OCP.

From table 3 create entries in Table 5 which detail the savesets required for each volume (which will
then be used to construct the OCP)

9.7 Step 7 — Validate Clone list
This step validates that the correct data has been identified and that there are no ‘GAPS’.
For each of the volumes in table 5 check that the savesets are correctly identified
Select Operations / Clone savesets
On the Clone Saveset screen
Set Volume to {volume name}
Clear field Start date
Clear field End date
Set Maximum level ‘radio button’ to Full
Press Query.....
On the returned Clone Saveset Query screen
Check that the Saveset date/times listed in table 5 for the volume are present and contiguous

9.8 Step 8 — Raise OCP

This step raises the OCP required for ISD NT to perform the Cloning work.
