Subject: Questions

All

T have been thinking about the question we will get about why we won't let SS look at everything - too which
the obvious answer is there is no evidence of a problem - and how we can demonstrate no evidence of a
problem.

Could we get details of:

- number of calls to helpline in a FY on accounting/Horizon issues
- details of cases resolved

- number of prosecutions over period of x years

- customer complaints related to alleged Horizon error

Angela: who should we bring in to help with this? I was thinking Andy Garner
