Hi Andrew

There has been significant archiving due to migration to outlook etc so we cannot access the full incident history for
specifics, however, from my personal emails along with what little we can see from the call log we have determined
the following.

The call was raised to the Service Desk on Friday 01 October 2010

Initial conference call with Fujitsu and P&BA (as was) for discussion of the issue and assessment of the impact was
scheduled for Monday 04 October at 13:00. This delay was due to details from Fujitsu on the issue being experienced
needing to be shared, the attendees agreed and an understanding of the impact formed before the requirement to
implement the Major Incident Process could be determined.

The incident was logged on remedy Monday 04 October 2010 during the 1" conference call at 13:00

Following on from the initial call a follow up was scheduled with Architects and Security from POL and with involved
parties from Fujitsu for 16:00.

I would say that the 13:00 call was a sense check of the information collated from Thursday 29 September 2010
(Documentation of Fujitsu investigations created by Gareth Jenkins (Fujitsu)) and Friday 01 October branch lists etc.
Tony and I agree that the 1600 call was the first initiation of the Major Incident process our reasoning being that from
this call a working group was formed to manage the incident to resolution.

I have attached the call log extract above however due to the age of the incident the full incident log data cannot be
extracted.

Many thanks
Emma

Hi

I have found problem HPBO20 which was assigned on 29/9/10. Not sure if this is the problem or not from the
description.

Hi
This is the first mail I can find from Tony referring to this.

Lesley Sewell needs a summary of the issue (which I have), when Fujitsu first alerted POL and when this was first
escalated as a major incident.

As I say this does need to be turned round today.

Many thanks

I have tried to keep away from being too detailed due to the senior stakeholders this report will be going to.

Please return with any comments/changes in blue
