Hi

Please can we schedule the note below in for a convenient moment over the next few days for an in the Loop?

You will recall that in August, the BBC broadcast a Panorama programme in which very serious allegations were made
about the actions of the Post Office.

In short, it was alleged that some postmasters were prosecuted over losses in branch when in fact there was no
evidence to support such action. The suggestion was that the losses were caused by flaws in the Horizon system
(despite the absence of any evidence to support this allegation in the cases referred to).

We made clear at the time that these allegations were not true and that the programme was highly misleading. We
also had some grave concerns about the way in which the programme was prepared and whether our position was
properly reflected given the BBC’s duty to ensure coverage is fair and balanced.

I wanted to let you know that this week we have submitted a formal complaint to the BBC about the Panorama
programme. This followed a meeting I held with the BBC’s director of news and current affairs and the editor of the

Panorama programme.

Please let your teams know about this: it is important that colleagues across the business are aware that we are highly
active in seeking to defend the business’ reputation in the face of these unsubstantiated allegations.

I will of course keep you updated and as ever don’t hesitate to drop me a line with any questions or comments.

Best wishes,
Mark

Communications and Corporate Affairs Director
