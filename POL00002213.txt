Dear Mr Mistry

Re Branch Discrepancies

This letter follows on from telephone conversations between the Post Office Finance
Service Centre and yourself regarding certain discrepancies which had been highlighted
during branch trading routines at your office. I would like to formally thank you for your
assistance in helping us to understand the sequence of events here from your branch
perspective. This has helped Post Office Ltd and our suppliers to determine the root
cause of the issue and to take action to resolve it.

The purpose of this letter is to summarise the outcomes of this review and to confirm
the remaining steps which we will be taking to conclude this incident.

Our investigations have determined that there was an isolated error in the data archiving
process in Horizon. In very rare situations of a branch deleting a stock unit at a
particular point in time in the month, this conflicted with the archiving process. {t led to
genuine loss or gain values in the deleted stock unit, in an earlier year, reappearing on
their anniversary date in subsequent years.

In summary, one of the stock units in your branch declared a loss of £9,799.88 in
December 2010 (Trading Period 9 TP9). The stock unit that declared the discrepancy
and placed it into Local Suspense was deleted on or before 10th December 2010.

In the same period, other stock units in your branch reported net gains, leading to a total
net loss of £3,463.01 for your office for TP9. You then followed the necessary steps ta
make good that loss.

In the normal course of events, the loss you had declared would have moved smoothly
through discrepancy accounts into Local Suspense and through to settlernent, with no
recurrence in future periods. However, due to the isolated system error and its impact
when a branch deletes a stock unit, the value of £9,799.88 reappeared in TP10 in the
two following years. Where there were other true losses and gains at that time, it
appeared as part of the net total.

In the interim, you have declared other gains and losses in the ordinary course of
business — a gain of £72.47 in 2012 and a loss £39.57 in 2013. In light of the archiving
issue, the net gain fram these two matters (£32.90) had been blocked centrally with the
other values under investigation.

We will now rectify this by including the £32.90 in your next month’s remuneration.
This will not be taxable and general advice has been issued to branches regarding the
treatment of such non-taxable items on remuneration slips.

In conclusion, we apologise for this incident and for any confusion and concern it may
have caused you.

We are pleased to confirm that the technical issue has been resolved and the erroneous
{oss for your branch has been dealt with.

Yours sincerely
