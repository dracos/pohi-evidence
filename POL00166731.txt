becoming a protected Trust Deed (see notes on the objections:required for that purpose)

Want to Register? of the date of publication of this notice in The Edinburgh Gazette.

fee Tense J Notes: The Trust Deed may become a protected Trust Deed unless, within the period of

. 5 weeks of the date of publication of this notice in The Edinburgh Gazette, a majority in
number or not less than one third in value of the creditors notify the Trustee, in writing,
that they object to the Trust Deed and do not wish to accede to It.

Briefly, this has the effect of restricting the rights of non-acceding creditors to do
diligence (ie to enforce court decrees for unpaid debts) against-the Debtor and confers
certain protection upon the Trust Deed from being superseded! by the sequestration of
the Debtor's estate.
