Subject: Summary of catch up with Tim Parker, 11 Sept

Tom C and I met with Tim Parker yesterday. Here is a quick summary

* Litigation. Due an update on the merits, we should mean POL better prepared for 17 Oct briefing. At the
moment POL don’t know exactly what they are dealing with. The time for settlement — if appropriate — would
be after 1* trial. Tom C emphasised that 17-10 meeting wasn’t for decision-making or for legal detail but
practical focus. Aim to give confidence to the minister/Perm Sec - POL should be well-rehearsed.
