Dear All

Further plans of actions and thoughts will follow, but in the meantime the timetable for the recusal application is as
follows:

Post Office to file a witness statement by 12pm on 26 March (further detail below)
Cs to confirm whether they will oppose the application by 12pm on 27 March

Cs responsive evidence to be filed on 29 March

Skeletons on 2 April

Hearing on 3 April

The first work stream is the Post Office witness statement, for which the Judge has directed that (taken from
transcript):

"Post Office to provide a witness statement by noon on Tuesday 26th -- but we can come and discuss the timing ina
moment -- that sets out: 1, the specific findings in the judgment referred to in paragraph 24 of Mr Parson's 14th witness
statement; 2, the critical invective referred to in paragraph 25 of Parsons 14; and 3, the criticisms of the Post Office
witnesses referred to in paragraph 25."

I anticipate that the work which has already been done towards the draft skeleton argument will cross-over with the
information which the Judge now wishes to be included within a witness statement. Gideon — would it be possible for
this information to be lifted out / to be finessed into a witness statement?

Kind regards

Amy
