Subject: Scope for Linklaters work

Cut down Outline Paper 14032014.docx

Paula,

Following discussion with you this afternoon we have further cut down and reconfigured the Linklaters paper — this is still slightly
rough and ready and will need some final finessing. It is with them overnight but conscious you asked for sight of where we got to.
Grateful for any comments — we plan to finalise with Linklaters before submitting to the Board tomorrow.

Regards

David
