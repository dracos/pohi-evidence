This should go to Jess first and then once she's happy it should go on to BD (piease send to Cathal who will organise the
legal review ~ including picking up comments from Rodric, Chris Aujard and CK where appropriate).

Kind regards

All
Please see case summary for the above which is due with the WG 9" Jan 2014.

i don’t know if there is a joined up approach yet for reviewing between legal & Jess; can someone advise what the
approach is now?

Many thanks
Shirley
