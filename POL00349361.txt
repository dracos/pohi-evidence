Subject: FW: Anthony Hooper-- Mediation case M030
Chris

Because of my concerns about Tony Hooper’s decision to allow criminal convicted case for mediation and assist in leave
to appeal to the court of appeal and risks for POL. I asked Simon Clarkes initial observations. Please see his email below.
Thanks.
Jarnail.

Subject: Sir Anthony Hooper

Jarnail,

I suggest that strenuous efforts be made to dissuade Sir Anthony Hooper from exercising his casting
vote in favour of permitting any criminal Applicant into the mediation scheme, particularly where
i egiccib eh aero whether the PO would agree to support an application for permission to appeal
that conviction” If not::

1. Many of the remaining 37 criminal Applicants will seek a similar concession, no doubt spurred
on by SS.

2. If an appeal succeeds: Horizon’s reputation would be fatally damaged; a further disclosure
exercise would be required; and further appeals would be launched including some of those
300+ criminal convictions we have reviewed.

3. Whilst POL could refuse to mediate this issue, the publicity generated by SS would be
unfortunate.
