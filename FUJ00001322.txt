2. Management Overview
2.1 Introduction
2.2 Objective of the Training Programme

ICL Pathway have contracted ICL TS Ltd to provide the training programme in support of the
POCL Counter Automation project. The training programme is required by ICL Pathway to
meet the following objectives:

Compatibility - The programme must be managed and delivered in a manner
consistent with the implementation programme undertaken by ICL Pathway Limited
and their other subcontractors.

Timeliness - No individual is to be trained more than five working days prior to the
automation of their normal counter position.

To the required scope, which is - “To ensure that all staff who work within a post
office are competent in the use of the automated platform, are aware of the
impact on operational procedures caused by the introduction of the platform
and that specialist staff are provided with the appropriate additional
information to perform their job role within an automated post office”

Achieve appropriate competence levels - The delivered programme is required to
ensure that 95% of personnel have a minimum competence that they are capable of
processing 90% of all transactions undertaken by their base office correctly.

2.3 Population to be trained

The current contract between POCL and ICL Pathway Ltd provides for 67,000 staff to be
trained. The analysis has identified approximately 71,000 staff to be trained excluding
turnover of both staff and postmasters which will occur during the implementation
programme. The number of staff within the roles identified are:

Postal Officers 7950
Branch 1300
Managers/ABM/POA
Subpostmasters 17750
Subpostmasters’ Assistants 40000
Franchise Managers & Staff 2000
Nominees & Staff 1000
Retail Network Managers 350
Auditors 200
Post Office Security 100
POCL Helpline 160
POCL Trainers 130

2.4 Baseline Competencies

There are fundamentally four groupings of competencies within the post office organisation,
as defined by Steve Dance of POCL SW & SW Region.

Numeracy - all POCL and Franchise employees are required to pass a numeracy test,
subpostmasters are not.

Counter Operations - it is POCL policy that all post office personnel are expected to operate
the counter transaction services offered at their location. Training however, is variable with
POCL employees having a 6 week training course whereas subpostmasters have a 10 day
event, with subsequent in-outlet support, they are also expected to take responsibility for the
training of their counter staff.

Office Administration and Accounts -The daily and weekly balancing functions together
with additional systems administration functions introduced by the platform need to be
included within training for management grades.

Specialist Functions - There are specialist and senior management functions within regions
and CB HQ e.g. audit and fraud investigations, which require a more in-depth knowledge of
the control and administration functions of the programme.

2.5 Learning Gap

For the majority of personnel a training programme covering counter transactions, daily and
weekly balancing and reporting functions, complemented by the changes to the associated
procedures is sufficient to meet their day to day operational requirements.

For managers, specialists and support staff a longer course covering both counter and
management implications of the programme is required.

Although the above requirements would satisfy the needs in terms of establishing operational
competence, it is essential that there is a 100% attendance at the training programme for
users and support staff. To accomplish this a high degree of co-operation is required within
the post office. The User Awareness programme must include a high level of quality
information on the implementation process and a motivational incentive for all locations and
be attended by the majority of managers and staff.

2.6 Proposed Training Programme

The training programme for the POCL Counter Automation programme on behalf of ICL
Pathway Ltd. should be modular in form, designed to be delivered to meet the operational
requirement of the post office with the minimum disruption to the business and
inconvenience to personnel.

The programme as a whole is introduced by the User Awareness event which enables offices

FUJ00001322

FUJ00001322
ICL Pathway Training Programme Ref: SU/TRN/001

to plan for the implementation and generate the necessary awareness of the business
benefits which are enabled for both POCL and their network of Branch and Sub post offices
by the introduction of the Counter Automation programme.

Counter staff within post offices are provided with a 1 day event, typically within 3 days of
system implementation.

Managers, specialists, support staff and other staff who deputise for managers are offered a
1.5 day event covering the stock control and accounting functions in addition to the counter
functions and procedures.

The training courses are closely synchronised with the implementation programme being
delivered at intervals of 13 weeks for User Awareness and 5 days prior to the target user “go-
live” date for User training.

All staff are invited to the Awareness programme, and it is highly desirable for all staff and
managers of post offices to attend. However, it is recognised that business and domestic
pressures will result in some staff being unable to attend and therefore contingency
procedures are required to ensure that such staff are not disadvantaged in the subsequent
implementation programme.

All staff who work within a post office must attend the appropriate course and achieve the
necessary level of competence. All courses include a competence test relating to their ability
to process a number of transactions to the required level of competence.

Following installation all post offices receive an training review visit to provide support and
clarification of any issues which may have arisen.

3. Approach
3.1 Research Undertaken

The research undertaken has included:-
(a.) Reviews with POCL secondees into Pathway.
(a.) Discussion with the reference South West & South Wales Region training staff.
(a.) Attendance by ICL TS trainers on the following activities:-
Sub Postmaster’s Induction Course (Hereford).
Post Office Cash Accounting Course (Cardiff).
(d.)Detailed reviews with POCL National Training Consultant - Sue Smith.

(a.) Visits and discussion with 6 reference post offices within the Swindon area and
supplementary discussion with local (North West & North Wales Region) sub postmasters.

3.1.1 Sources of Information

POCL Secondee (Palm Singh)

BA Secondee (Julie Walsh) 222
BA Secondee (Mark Cousens) 222
Post Masters Induction Course (Angela Hillier)

Cash Accounting Course (Steve Dance)

POCL Procedural Manuals

Interviews with POCL staff at both branch offices and sub postmasters within the assigned
(Swindon) area.

Meetings with POCL Training Managers (Melanie Sherman)

Meeting with POCL Training Consultant (Sue Smith)

3.2 Establishment of Training Delivery Capability

In addition to the ability to train the post office staff to use the automated platform it was
considered at an early stage that for the training programme and individual trainers to have
credibility they would require a familiarity with POCL operations rather than simply
knowledge of the automated platform. The establishment of a trainer's induction programme
which incorporates understanding of both the automated and non-automated office is critical
to the success of the programme.

4. Findings
4.1 Post Offices

4.1.1. Types of Post Office
There are a number of types of post office including:
e Branch Offices
« Modified Subpostoffices, which supersede the geographic scope previously
covered by a Branch Office
« Franchise Offices
« Cash account subpostoffice
« Non cash account subpostoffice
These post offices vary in size, and other than Branch Offices, ownership. The principal
groups of employer are:
e Post Office Counters (Branch only)
e Multiple Retailers e.g. Martins Retail
e Independent Retailers
In addition there is a large variance in the size of offices as shown below

Totals 19,403 39,507 100

4.1.2 Basic Competencies

4.1.2.1 Numeracy

All POCL employees are required to pass a numeracy test, subpostmasters are not.

4.1.2.2 Counter Operations

It is POCL policy that all post office personnel are expected to operate the counter
transaction services offered at their location. Training however, is variable with POCL
employees having a 6 week modular training course whereas subpostmasters have a 10 day
event, with subsequent in- outlet support, and are also expected to take responsibility for the
training of their counter staff.

4.1.2.3 Office Administration and Accounts

All subpostmasters, counter managers and some assistants, plus other management

functions. The daily and weekly balancing functions together with additional systems
administration functions introduced by the platform need to be included within training for
management grades.

4.1.2.4 Specialist Functions

There are specialist and senior management functions within regions and CBHQ (e.g. audit
and fraud investigations) which require a more in-depth knowledge of the control and
administration functions of the system.

4.1.3 Job Roles

There are 25 job titles (with associated grades) within the post office organisation. These
titles may be simplified into the following roles:-

Postal Officers (POCL)

The function of this job role is to serve POCL customers with a varied range of transactions.
They are accountable to POCL and all clients for report production, daily and weekly, and are
fully accountable for all transactions, plus cash and stock. Approximately 50% of postal
officers are part-time.

Branch Managers, Assistant Branch Managers and Postal Officer with Allowance
Responsible for the efficient operation of their post office throughout the year. They provide

operational expertise in resolving areas of uncertainty in client/customer service. They are
fully responsible for their staff and the production of an office cash account.

ICL Pathway Training Programme Ref: SU/TRN/001

Training Needs Analysis Version: 2.0
Date: 07/07/99

Subpostmasters (Agent of POCL)

They are business people with a private business acting as POCL agents for the community.
Their expertise is basically the same as a postal officer, with the additional responsibility for
the production of the office account.

Subpostmasters’ assistants (employee of a Subpostmaster)

Are employed by sub postmaster and their general duties are basically the same as a postal
officer and are not always independent stock or cash holders but can carry out weekly
balances for their sub postmaster.

Franchise Managers (Employee of Franchise owner or Multiple Retailer)

Mainly dedicated staff employed to operate post office concessions within large retail outlets.
They perform the same job role as branch manager/postal officer. Staff employed within
these outlets are normally part-time and the concession opening hours normally are extended
to be the same as the retail outlet.

Multiple (Nominees)

Multiple companies, e.g. Forbuoys, operate chains of retail outlet in which a post office
service is run. The staff running the post office are normally employees of the particular
multiple. They perform the same role as subpostmasters and subpostmasters’ assistants.
Retail Network Managers (POCL)

POCL employed managers who are responsible for the efficient operation of a number of
post offices providing advice on various topics, responsible for appointing subpostmasters
and branch managers.

Relief Subpostmasters (Freelance)

Normally contracted in by the subpostmaster for holiday relief, they have the same
responsibilities for the smooth running of the business and normally have the same skills
levels as subpostmasters.

Regional / National Auditors (POCL)

Responsible for all financial/accounting and operational procedures within the post office.
POCL Security & Investigation Service (POCL)

Responsible for the prevention/investigation of both external and internal crime. They have a
working knowledge of POCL counter operations and accounting procedures.

POCL Helpline (POCL or Freelance)

Normally ex postal officers who provide telephone support to both counter staff and the
public.

POCL Trainers (POCL)
Responsible for training counter staff in a classroom environment and on the job training

within a franchise outlet or subpostoffice.

Regional Support Staff (POCL)

Training Needs Analysis Version: 2.0
Date: 07/07/99

4.1.5 Availability for Trai

The critical factors are:-

50% of POCL counter staff and 80% of subpostoffice assistants work part-time and a
significant percentage are female with domestic responsibilities.

A large number of offices with 1 or 2 counter positions have a small establishment, typically
operated by a husband and wife. The implication is that day time training would involve either

closing the business or incurring the expenditure of a relief postmaster. The actual option
exercised would be governed by the POCL reimbursement policy.

4.1.6 The Operational Environment

Counter positions are generally cramped and subject to interruption to service customer
requirements, even when officially closed. They are therefore unsuitable for the efficient
delivery of initial training relating to agreed major operational change.

4.2 Facilities of the Automated Platform

The facilities currently defined by ICL Pathway as included within Release 1 of the automated
platform are:-

Order Book Control Service (OBCS).
Electronic Point of Sale (EPoS)
Automated Payments System (APS)

These functions transform the processing of counter transactions and will significantly impact
the existing balancing procedures and submission of data to Chesterfield.

4.3 Training Delivery Options

4.3.1 \n-Outlet Traii

ing

The operational environment precludes the efficient delivery of in-outlet training. The AnPost
experience, where such an approach was applied, resulted in a much slower progression
towards live working than would be acceptable for this programme (i.e. 1 month from
installation) complemented by a much more labour intensive requirement for training staff.

ICL Pathway Training Programme Ref: SU/TRN/001

Training Needs Analysis Version: 2.0
Date: 07/07/99

4.3.2 Classroom Training

A dedicated classroom event, with user interaction and a delivery within the context of the
business operation has been identified by research to be the most efficient process for initial
learning. However, to be truly efficient the venues must be readily accessible i.e. 15-30
minutes travel, and timings of events must satisfy both business and domestic requirements.

4.3.3 Programmed Learning

Programmed learning techniques using an operational workbook have been found to be
efficient provided the following conditions can be provided:

(a.) Readily accessible support for problem areas.

(a.) Awareness by the trainee that their individual progress is being monitored.

(a.) Time to undertake the consolidation exercises within the programme by the required
deadline.

For the majority of post offices the conditions could only be provided for limited learning
activities e.g. update programmes.

4.3.4 Computer Based Training (CBT)

CBT would provide the ideal medium for training consolidation and subsequent provision of
back-up support. However, the secure nature of the Riposte application, the heart of the
automated platform precludes the coexistence of other software packages. As a
consequence this approach has been discounted as not technically viable, rather a training
mode where procedures may be undertaken from within, rather than alongside, the
application could be used to replicate and record progress. Such a facility could be used to
provide ongoing support, remedial and refresher training as the product and personnel
develop.

4.4 Maintaining Competencies

Having established the core operational competencies it is essential to maintain expertise as
staff within the business change and also new postmasters are appointed.

The general levels of staff turnover are:-

POCL staff (low) < 5%
Subpostmasters (Medium) 10%
Subpostmasters’ assistants (High) 15-20%

The subpostmasters’ assistants turnover rate is derived from studies undertaken by ICL TS
Ltd on behalf of Camelot Group PLC of post office National Lottery outlets.

POCL themselves do not monitor the competence of subpostmaster’s assistants and there
are legal constraints which imply that POCL are not permitted to provide training and
development for this group which represents approximately 60% of the population.

5. Recommendations
5.1 Implementation Training
5.1.1 Post Offices

The training programme for the POCL Counter Automation programme on behalf of ICL
Pathway Ltd. should be modular in form, designed to be delivered to meet the operational
requirement of the post office with the minimum disruption to the business and
inconvenience to the personnel.

The programme as a whole is introduced by the User Awareness event, which enables
offices to plan for the implementation and generate the necessary awareness of the business
benefits, which are enabled for both POCL and their agencies by the introduction of the
programme.

Training for counter staff must be delivered within a classroom environment, the duration for
this training being 1 day to ensure that there is sufficient learning and practical time to reach
the target level of competence and for proper assessment. However, some will require the
1.5-day course in order to enable them to undertake additional duties or provide
management cover.

Management and support personnel, including relief staff, require an extended course of 1.5
days to include the management and administration functions within the post office. In order
to provide flexibility of timing this would be offered within 5 working days of the planned
implementation.

The training courses are closely synchronised with the implementation programme being
delivered 12 weeks and 5 days prior to the target user “go-live” date. Each event will be
made available within 30 minutes travelling time for the majority of outlet staff and at a time
to cause minimum operational and personal inconvenience.

All staff should attend the awareness programme and, in addition, all staff who work within a
post office must attend the course appropriate to their role and achieve the necessary level of
competence. To ensure this, the site survey must encompass verification of the
management duties undertaken, in particular identifying staff who deputises in managerial
positions. A training review visit is provided which may be apportioned according to the
individual needs of the staff within an office. The needs will also vary according to the type of
transition undertaken by an office e.g. for an automated office the visit will be synchronised
to support the initial live operation.

The training programme incorporates testing and review procedures, which correspond to
Kirkpatrick levels 1 and 2 in accordance with service level agreements specified in
Requirement 915 of the contract between POCL (for POCL) and ICL Pathway Ltd.

5.2 Staff Changes
§.2.1 Staff Turnover
5.2.1.1 POCL Offices

It is considered that the responsibility for training new staff within POCL’s own offices is best
undertaken by incorporating training for the automated platform within the counter skills
training course currently being reviewed by the National Training function within Post Office
Counters Ltd. Training staff should be required to attend the POCL Train the Trainer event
provided by ICL TS on behalf of ICL Pathway Ltd. Having attended the event they will be
included in the distribution list for trainer update notifications and also be authorised to order
training materials. In order to ensure maintenance of training standards the trainer
accreditation will include a formal update/refresher event provided either annually or to
support new product releases.

5.2.1.2 Independent sub post offices (i.e. Sub post offices not owned by a multiple
retailer)

During the implementation programme it is recommended that new sub postmasters and
their assistants receive the standard training programmes for manual offices with a
supplementary Horizon counter training event appropriate to their role.

§.2.2 Staff Promotions

During the roll out period counter operations staff may be promoted to management positions
or otherwise asked to perform a management function not covered by the basic counter
operations course.

ICL Pathway will offer a 1 day management upgrade course. This event would review basic
counter operations, in order to verify baseline entry competence, and cover those topics
covered in the manager's course, Appendix D3 but not included within D2.

The associated competency test would cover management functions only.

5.3 Product/Facility Update Training
5.3.1 Approach

Update training will be carried out whenever a post office is planned to receive new or
updated software functionality to their existing ICL Pathway work station system.

Update training will comprise one or all of the following dependant upon degree of user
change involved in the upgrade or release:

e Classroom training

e Self study materials

¢ Plain notification

5.3.2 Categories of update

There are 3 categories of update defined for which therefore is a corresponding training
strategy/policy.

bill payments, selling stocked product lines, payment of benefits, banking and mail
services. They are accountable to POCL and responsible for production of daily and weekly
client reporting, till balancing, stock and cash ordering movement. At present much of the

Training Constraints

After the Induction Course a POCL Trainer is allocated to a particular outlet for a period of 2
weeks. Because these outlets are normally owned by the subpostmaster, off the job training
during business hours presents difficulties. Training has to be on an ad-hoc basis in a “live”
situation covering transactions as they happen. Any transactions in this period not covered
“live” from the trainers check list will be covered in theory.

After training the outlet will receive a trainer's support and help for the following two cash
account periods.

The staff in this job role are as required by the shop/subpostoffice business as a whole, in

contracts to run the sub post office and conducting audits. This role is critical to the success
of the roll out throughout the network.

An RNM'‘s responsibilities include the following:

1 Ensuring that allocated outlets run in a professional manner in line with POCL
guidelines.

2. A full understanding of all POCL working procedures.
