Dear Andy,

Thank you for your e-mail of 6 September.

I attach what should hopefully be the final copy of your Witness Statement for approval and the

exhibit. Please read the Witness Statement very carefully and if you have any further changes, please feel
completely free to make them. Once you are totally happy with the Witness Statement, please print it
out, sign and date it and return it to me, retaining a copy for yourself.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Kind regards.

Stephen Dilley
Solicitor

for and on behalf of Bond Pearce LLP
