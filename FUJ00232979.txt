ACCEPTANCE OF LIABILITY DISPUTED BY: PON

DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:

A base unit swap out occurred at Cricceth PO FAD: 164604 during December 2000 (Lost transactions for
weeks 37 — 41). This Office was unable to reconcile for these four cash account weeks until a download of
the missing transactions recovered from the faulty base unit had occurred. However, the office has now
been left with a discrepancy of approximately £4400, which is being held in the suspense account pending
resolution. For cash account weeks 37 — 41, the office produced manual cash accounts that were sent to
PON / TIP who has adjusted their accounting systems to reflect the figures contained within these manual
accounts. In doing so, the office still appears to carry a discrepancy and the Horizon system within the
office still shows the original loss. To date, TP have only identified a net discrepancy of £156.22. After
further investigation by ICL Pathway, no other transactions can be isolated.

ICL PATHWAY STATEMENT:

There is no evidence to say how much of the discrepancy currently being held in this office (approximately
£4400 at this stage) is due to the problems experienced which necessitated the base unit swap. ICL Pathway
are unable to offer direct financial recompense at this stage, although recognition is made of the fact that the
system did behave erratically prior,to the engineer visit and the swap out. ‘This case should therefore be
referred to ICL Pathway / PON Commercial for discussion re. any possible compensation.
