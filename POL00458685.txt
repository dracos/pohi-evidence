Subject: RE: Deloitte Report
Hello — I’ve had several emails alerting me of an imminent report over the last 3 weeks but still no report.

I will be on the SLT Hay development course for the next 2 days and in urgent Finance Roadmap meetings most of the
rest of the time.

I am unclear what will be coming my way and when.
Please can you advise
Thanks, Rod

In order to manage the control of the Deloitte reports I would be grateful if a copy could be provided to Rod.
Rod!

I have asked Julie to pull together the actions that should be taken forward, this will be presented to the Risk and
Compliance Committee. As such she will be in touch to agree actions for your area.
