that came to light with the list of MP cases was that they included the Mishra you will remember the case
and the publicity she went to prison and had her baby whilst in there. The husband got publicity through
radio and press. Susan's anxiety and she raised this at the meeting with Alice before you joined was
whether now contacting her to tell her we review the case would be a red rag to a bull.

If you want a call before you call Alice my phone is on

Alice, if Susan doesn't get back to you, I'm around so call me on the mobile. I wasn't party to this
part of the discussion as it was when I was in the Eagle meeting. But we can talk and I can pick up with
Susan on Monday.

call when it suits. Paula

>> Following a conversation with Alwen yesterday, and given that I am away now for a few days, I thought
I should let you know before I went where I stand on which cases should be in or out of this review.

>> I have given this more thought since yesterday.

>> I am clear that we should include ALL the MPs’ cases, irrespective of whether they have been decided
in Court. If we try to draw a distinction here we will be accused of picking cases to suit ourselves and
being vulnerable on the ones we omit. we'll have a row about that instead of moving the issue on.

>> On reflection, I don't buy the argument that we would somehow undermine the Court process by doing
this. There are plenty of ways in which people go over ground which has been settled in Court and if
there weren't, no-one would ever be able to get a conviction overturned. And if (which we don't believe)
there were new evidence in a case which had been decided, we would want to do, and be seen to do, the
right thing by that.

>> So I stick by the ToR as drafted yesterday on this important point.

>> Where I think there may be an issue is the line between Shoesmith's cases which have been declared to
us and those (many more) which they have merely hinted at. I suggest the way to deal with those may be by
time, ie we'll include those we know about as of Monday week but not those which come after. As we said
at our meeting, it would be open to the independent reviewers to say in their findings that they think we
should extend the review.

>> I am sorry to be bothering you with this on a Saturday but time is against us, especially as Paula is
seeing James Arbuthnot on Monday afternoon and I feel very strongly about this.

>> I am around this morning packing etc if you want to talk to me and of course, if necessary, you can
raise me while I'm away.

>> Thank you
