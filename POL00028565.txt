I am interested in any comments you have on the document which I will accept and manage via

You will note that we have included a series of meetings which need to take place many of

which are not yet agreed (TBC) due to diary contention, however, once agreed will be

Decisions whether to Suspend Roll-out

Purpose of this Paper

On September 24" 1999 POCL Accepted the Pathway Services, but modified the Codified
Agreement to protect POCL against the deficiencies in the Services identified as part of the
Acceptance activity. These changes in the Codified Agreement are contained in the Second
Supplemental Agreement. One aspect of this is the addition of a review for POCL to
determine whether the Services have been improved sufficiently to allow the roll-out to
continue after the Christmas break on January 24" 2000. The purpose of this paper is to
describe the process by which that decision will be made.

This paper includes:

© a description of the criteria on which the decision will be made as specified in the Second
Supplemental Agreement

© a proposal on the set of meetings which should take place to inform the decision, manage
issues and make the decision in November

 aproposal on the set of meeting which should take place to inform the decision, manage
issues and make the decision in January (DN not in this version, but process would be
similar to that for the November decision, starting on return from the Christmas break)

© a proposal on what to do next should the decision be to suspend roll-out.

The Second Supplemental Agreement
Section 6 of the agreement states that suspension of Rollout may occur if:

1. any of the criteria in parts A to C of Schedule 4 (relating to: system stability (A1298); TIP
Interface Accounting Integrity (AI376); and Helpdesk Performance (AI 408)) shall not be
met by 24" November, 1999.or;

2. the Accounting Integrity Control Release Date shall not have occurred by 14% January,
2000 or;

3. any of the criteria set out in part D of Schedule 4 (relating to TIP Interface Accounting
Integrity (AI376)) shall not have been met by 14” January, 2000.

Tfany of the above occur, “POCL shall be entitled by notice to the Contractor to postpone the
resumption of Rollout from 24 January, 2000 until such later date as shall be agreed...”.

“IfPOCL gives notice...the parties shall meet as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter
with a view to agreeing and documenting:-
1, aplan and timetable for re-testing and demonstrating the satisfaction of each of the criteria
set out in Parts A to D (inclusive) of Schedule 4 not then satisfied; and
2. arevised Roll-out Programme to take effect once the satisfaction of all such criteria shall
have been demonstrated and the Accounting Integrity Control Release Date shall have
occurred.”

The Acceptance Resolution Timetable (Version 1.0 dated 24* September 1999) forms part of
the Second Supplemental Agreement. Activities related to the Roll-out Decision are:

© Joint Delivery Review meeting 7 (Review Criteria NRO 2000). This indicates that the
Pathway/POCL review mecting on the 24" November will be a key Acceptance

The table below shows the meetings that will take place to reach and manage the implications
of the decision. If it is determined at the Delivery mecting on 24* November that Pathway

The main deliverables supporting the meetings are the monitoring reports describing
Pathway’s performance against the criteria. Currently there are discrepancies between the
POCL and Pathway reports for Als 376 and 408. The early working-level meetings are
planned to address these discrepancies so that a jointly agreed report can be provided to the
