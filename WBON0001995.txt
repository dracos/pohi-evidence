Tony, Simon, HSF, Rodric

Please find attached a revised letter to Freeths which I hope takes into account the matters discussed on the call,
along with a compare to the previous version of the letter. We would welcome any proposed amendments to the
letter.

It may be easiest if Tony/Simon provide their comments first, following which HSF/Rod can provide any further input,
but please feel free to provide comments earlier if it would be more convenient or if there is anything which is pressing.

Many thanks
Amy
