Subject: BBC 6pm News

Just to let you know that BBC News just carried a news in brief piece with accompanying branch footage
which latest about 20 seconds.

Ran along the lines of "Around 100 SPMRs are embroiled in a bitter dispute with the Post Office over a
computer system they claim is losing them money every year". Not ideal but probably the next best
thing to nothing appearing at all. We'll circulate the clip once we receive it.

Nothing on BBC online yet. Expecting two human-interest style regional TV pieces from BBC Look North
and BBC Look South.

Best
Nina
