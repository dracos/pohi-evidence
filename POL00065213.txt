Dear Mr. Aujard
Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme ("the Scheme")

I have previously written to you to provide you with a copy of Second Sight’s Part One
Report and their draft Case Reviews for cases M001, M002, M019, M030, M035, M052,
M066, M079 and M143. I am pleased to now enclose Second Sight’s Part Two Report.

Now that you have been provided with the Part Two Report it is open to you to provide
comments on Second Sight’s draft Case Review Reports. Any comments that you might
wish to make about Second Sight’s draft reports must be sent to Second Sight so as to
arrive by 4 September 2014. I am sorry to impose a rather tight timetable on you but we are
very anxious to progress the cases as quickly as possible. Please send all comments to
Second Sight directly at the following address: Ron Warmington, Tythe Farm, Maugersbury,
Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, GL54 1HR or by email to rw: i. If nothing is
received by 4 September 2014, Second Sight will assume that you do not intend to
comment. If you do not intend to comment it would be helpful if you told us so.

Second Sight will consider any comments that are made and may amend their draft reports
in light of any comments from you and from the applicant. Once the reports are finalised,
both you and the applicant will be given a copy of the final reports and notified whether or
not the cases will be recommended for mediation. Both parties will be given a copy or a
summary of the comments made by the other party.

Yours sincerely,

Sir Anthony Hooper
Chair of the Working Group
