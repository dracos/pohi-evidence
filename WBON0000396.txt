Andy,
I hope you had a nice few days off.
Outline of the factfile attached. Rod rang me yesterday, he would like to see a working draft sometime next week.

For now I have kept it segmented into the different areas which were identified (with a list of what questions are still
outstanding) — I thought this was easier so that we can send the text for a particular area (and the remaining
questions) to the individual who has provided the info. However, we will probably want to move some of the areas
around once we have finalised the text.

Areas where we still need info:

- Audit (I think you were going to send me the email address for Nick Beal who can address this)
- Thematic issues (some of this I think you may have has reference is made to spot reviews and the contract info
— if you email/discuss with me I will incorporate).

It is quite long and some of it could come out, particularly around the training (I have square bracketed where I think
info could come out unless it is relevant to the applicants in the Scheme). Once you have reviewed it (you may be able
to answer some of the questions I have raised with your extensive POL knowledge!) I suggest we send each section to
the relevant person to sign off the wording/answer the additional/outstanding questions. We can then put it in Post
Office format, top and tail it and consider the running order.

I'm around all next week if you want to discuss.
