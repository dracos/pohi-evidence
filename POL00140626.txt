This is not great news, but did it expect this to be 'change' related. Frankly, I'm
getting a little tired of the overnight changes killing service the next day. This
needs sorting and seriously sorting. I want to see a full

Post Mortem with recommendations. If our testing regime didn't pick it up, it's
not fit for purpose.

We lost a lot of business this morning and our brand took another confidence
hit. Not great.

Mike,

As is standard practice, Fujitsu looked at the changes deployed last night
in order to establish whether any of these could have caused the issues.

From this they established that a standard monthly reference data
change, which was enlivened this morning, was the cause of the issue.
The change was successfully tested on the Fujitsu reference data test
rig, the Post Office ref data test rig and the Live System Test (LST) rig
before it went out. All of those rigs were able to process Card Account
transactions this morning.

We clearly have to investigate this further to understand why a
reference data change that has (seemingly) followed the correct
processes and testing has caused issues in the live environment.

With regards to you earlier question, Fujitsu do still perform their
system checks every morning at 7am and these checked out ok. The gap
here would appear to be that they are checking technology components
and not looking at whether transaction services can be performed. I
have picked this up with James and we are sitting down next Monday to
see what they can do to change/improve this.

Branches now have the fix and we’re seeing card account transactions
come through across the estate.

All

Apologies for the delay -
Card Account transactions through Horizon are

affected. Card Account through ATM’s is unaffected.
Santander and Partner Banks are NOT affected.

POL-0142081
There are reports that certain Automated Payments (bill
payments) are impacted.

A fix is in the process of being tested and will hopefully
(based on test results) be deployed within the next 40
minutes.

Communications have been issued to branches and we
are updating the other comms channels as appropriate
(Subspace on-line, External Comms, NFSP).

Dave

It would appear from the data we have to hand that this
is affecting all branches.

Debit and Credit card settlements i.e. as a method of
payment are unaffected.

We'll send another update in the next 30 minutes.
