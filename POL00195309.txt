Common agreement reached on majority of Working Party TOR, the
voting right issue will be resolved after the appointment of the
independent chair.

e Meeting held yesterday to review/agree ways of working with SS.

Agreements have been sent to the Panel Advisors to sign and return,
the final list of advisors will be provided to SPMR’s who can choose
one of these advisors or select a firm of their choice.
Mediation Pack Funding agreements to be sent to SPMR’s this week.
As at 11 September 2012 SS had received 20 cases. The WG agreed
© 16 should go into the mediation scheme
o 2 should go into the scheme following PO checks
o 1 would be returned to the subpostmaster for further
information.
© 1 would progress internally (not exhausted PO process)
The group will meet weekly to review new cases and ensure
progress on actions.
Following the positive meeting between Alice Perkins and JA. JA’s
office are drafting a letter to MPs suggesting that a meeting in October
would not be required and pushing this out until the new year.

Once the Independent Chair is on board we will review the future
process — this work stream will then be re-planned.

Following the meeting with JA and discussion at the steering board we
have focused on Sir Antony Hooper. Paula Vennells and Alasdair
Marnoch will meet him on September 24".

After this meeting we will try to get Sir Anthony Hooper to agree a fixed
fee for the work to take us up until the end of March 2014.

No updates but following the Steering board on 11" September we will
return to the original plan and hold the first forum in October.
