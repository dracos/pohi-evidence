I Shirley Hailstones

Good morning Kath, Shirley

Please find attached an extract from the draft Defence which relates to the various investigations that you have
undertaken for us. I have also attached a copy of the claim which Post Office is responding to and is referred to within
the Defence.

It would be much appreciated if you could review the extract and provide any comments which you may have. In
particular, if there are any points which are incorrect, please could you flag and explain these. If you feel that it would
more appropriate to check some of these sections with other areas of the business (i.e. the section on the Helpline
with Gayle / Kendra) please let us know.

Would it be possible to complete this review by close of business on Thursday, 6 June?

Kind regards

Amy
