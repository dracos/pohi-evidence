Annette

Not sure what format you are using for the BNR/TP briefing, but here is my contribution on Sparrow. Richie, let me
know if anything to add from your side.

REVIEW OF POST OFFICE HORIZON SYSTEM

In October-erntakingpthe rele, you asked Tim to undertake a review of Post Office’s Horizon IT system, specifically,
the complaints received about potential errors in the system, and Post Office’s handling of those claims.

As previously advised, Tim appointed a QC (Jonathan Swift, former First Treasury Counsel) to assist him in this review.
He has held a number of meetings including with Lord (James) Arbuthnot and with the independent investigators
Second Sight.

Tim is currently in the process of finalising this work, and we expect he will want to explain his initial thoughts on
what he has found and what further steps he wants to take. We suggest you discuss with Tim whether and how the
findings of his work might be made public. Andrew Bridgen MP and Oliver Letwin MP have expressed interest in
hearing the outcome of his review.

You should also note that:

e The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) continue their investigations into a small number of
applications (c.20) and Post Office continue to provide the CCRC with all information requested. There is still
no indication that the CCRC will complete their investigations any time soon.

e Further to the November press notice that the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA) are preparing a
group action against Post Office on this matter, Post Office had some limited correspondence with the legal
firm appointed by the JFSA, Freeths Solicitors, but are yet to receive any letter before action.
