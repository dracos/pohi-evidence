Value Proposition

* Re-introduce the ability to make changes which, when grouped
together, deliver economies of scale

* Catch-up release, post change freeze, before re-establishing an
ongoing pattern of incremental releases

* Provide an enabler for major projects i.e. Globe & PIN Pad
¢ Use of pre-pay & credit notes for development, test and design
¢ Will provide enabler for changes to support POL 11 to 16 strategy

¢ Peter Rowley, Mike Wood and Andy Hall presented to Mike Young —
Director of Operations (POL) that the Globe enablers would be part of
Release 2. The date for Release 2 is to be agreed with POLby mid
July.

Competition

* Release strategy is not competitive

* Risk beyond R2 of POL’s architectural direction driving away from
HNG-X, limiting subsequent release contents

Win Strategy

Establish payment drivers as separate “streams”

Stream 1
Stream 2
Stream 3
Stream 4
Stream 5

Release costs

Indirect staff / overhead costs
Retention of Minimum capability
Infrastructure provision & support
Project specific work via individual CT

Separate Release 2 resource / infrastructure from Release 3 onwards requirements
Release 2 is tactical, need to plan Release 3 onwards separately

Release 2 — aim to submit deliverables by end July 09

Agree commercial approach and approach to credit notes and pre-pay

Establish revised governance around ‘new business to HNG-X’ to ensure joined up
approach

Establish effective relationship plan to ensure all elements move forward to meet
the release timescales
