Continuous Assurance - Group Assurance Opinion

Executive Summary

As the SEG is aware Continuous Assurance commenced in January 2024 and is continuing to embed
across the various functions.

As evident from the table above the outcomes of assurance range from Green to Red, which reflects the
divergence in the complexity of the functions involved and pace at which functional self-assessment is
becoming BAU.

The key messages as at 30" April 2024 are:
Retail

a) Functional self-assessments need to be significantly improved along with the quality of artefacts
forwarded to GA for our objective assessment.

b) The level of open management actions remains significantly high. Since the ClJ review only 16%
(13 out of 83) have been closed to date.

c) 36 overdue management actions relate to Postmaster Policies, majority of which have a reforecast
date for closure of June 2024.

Risk — the status of Functional Assessment and level of open management actions have a direct correlation
to Retails ability to demonstrate their conformance with the issue judgement and impacts on actions
delivered on Postmasters.

GA opinion - engagement and communication between GA and Retail is continually improving and we can
see Retail moving in the right direction, i.e., changing their approach to self-assessment and proactively
challenging artefacts before sending to GA. That said these improvements will take time to embed and
trickle through to the dashboard.

A&Cl

Engagement with A&Cl is exceptional with self-assessment fully imbedded and quality of artefacts to
demonstrate their control environment is robust.

Other

We have engaged with Culture and Remediation Unit from April 24 to commence their self-assessment
and should be reporting against these in Q2.

Please refer to Appendix 1 which shows the breakdown of Open Management Actions.
