POLB08/32(c): weekly sales continued to track significantly and
materially below business case. This would be escalated to
WHS Senior Management to agree remedial action. A meeting
would take place between Alan Cook and Kate Swann.

FINANCE FUNCTIONAL REPORT POLB(08)37

Peter Corbett presented the finance report and period 12
performance pack to the Board;

the operating profit at half-year was £28:5m, which was just
£(0.5)m behind budget. Although this meant thatthe target was
in sight, there remained concerns that. sales were 4% behind
target and were being offset by other income streams such.as
bank commission from Card Account and cost savings. To be
confident of delivering the rest of the Plan sales needed to be
back on track;

in Period 6 the profit share from POFS was revised to reflect the
accounting method that had been established for the ‘Gamma’
contract with the Bank of Ireland. This would improve income at
the expense of profit share and the net impact was within
budget. This was the principle reason for the £(4.5)m variance
on profit share in the month;

it was agreed that an appropriate internal communications
briefing would be prepared to explain the financial results of the
Company;

the Product & Branch Accounting (P&BA) capacity and business
cases backlogs continued to reduce but P&BA was very
stretched. Higher profile reviews of Saving Stamps and ATMs
were positive but P&BA continued to overspend on agency;

the Board noted the performance pack.
