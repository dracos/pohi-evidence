Thanks Luke

Not Mrs Phillips of course ~ Mrs Etheridge. Michelle is away, so Tim’s going to give me another name of someone in
Michelle’s team to ensure the mechanics are in place/fed into your draft — you can send the draft to me only.

We will prepare a draft response to Freeths and circulate it for approval, once we have Michelle's instructions on the
mechanics that Mrs Phillips needs to follow to reduce her instalments.

Kind regards,

Luke.

Thanks Tim

Dear WBD team ~ please action as below = but wait for Michelle to comment. Also, i'd like to see the draft response
before it is sent to Freeths as you were going to include some form of wording such that this is without prejudice to the
respective positions in the group litigation.

By this email I am cc’ing Michelle Stevens:

Dear Michelle - for this branch, Tim has approved that the monthly repayments will be reduced to £15 per month in
response to a request from the PMR via Freeths. Bond Dickinson will correspond with Freeths to confirm this is agreed
but can you teil us all, is it a question of WBD telling Freeths that the payments can be reduced from xxx date and
otherwise paid to POL in the usual manner — if it is more complicated than that, do you want to suggest a sentence to
include in the letter going back to Freeths please to confirm the mechanics of payment going forward at the lower
amount of £15?

Thanks

Ben

Hi Ben,

I agree with your proposed approach and think it represents a better commercial decision than spending time and
resource on discussions between parties.

Michelle Stevens in my team is the point of contact for reducing the debt repayments.

Kind regards,

458/611 - instructions needed - legal privilege/confidential
legal privilege/confidential/do not share
Dear Neil/Tim

Attached are:

e Letter to Freeths from WBD dated 4 July and its enclosures (previous emails between the Etheridges and WBD)
* Letter back from Freeths to WBD dated 24 July.

Your instructions are needed in response to the Freeth 24 July letter.

The background to this matter as it was back in April is this:

Background

Claim issued in March 2012 against former subpostmaster Mrs Tracey Etheridge.

Admission filed by Mrs Etheridge with an offer of £5 month — offer rejected

Judgment secured for £11,118.15 on 16 April 2012 payable forthwith

Final Charging Order secured against property (49 Winnifred Street) on 29 June 2012 for sum of £11,209.81
Offer of repayment accepted at the rate of £30.94 per month. Repayments maintained.

oe ee

What we need your instructions on is this:
e POLhas a judgment against Tracey Etheridge, secured by a charging order over their home.
e They had previously sought a re-mortgage and requested a settlement figure from us. Freeths now say that
they no longer want to re-mortgage. Instead they say that Ms Etheridge wants to reduce the instalments she is

paying to POL from £31 to £15 per month. Freeths suggest that discussions about this take place direct between
Ms Etheridge and POL (see the attached letter).

The Former Debt team had historically dealt with the matter. Please can you confirm whether we should put Ms
Etheridge in touch with the Former Debt team or someone else about this?

e Alternatively, please confirm if POL accepts the lower figure of £15 per month, in which case we could simply
confirm this to Freeths to avoid the need for any discussions between the parties?

My advice to you is this, but of course it is a commercial consideration for you:

Agreement may be the pragmatic and sensible position given (1) these are Freeths Claimants and (2) they are
continuing to pay and (3) it avoids dialogue with them and (4) we are talking about c£i1k ll adds up to

POL-0077752
POLO0081189
POL00081189

simply accepting the lower monthly repayments reduced from £31 to £15 per month as proposed ~ ie - we
instruct WBD to tell Freeths that their client’s request of 24 July is granted.

Can you confirm if you are agreeable to this and I will liasie with WBD over the form of letter they send back to Freeths
to relfect that. Also, tell me who to tell within the Aagent Debt team that the monthly amount of repayment will be
changing to this lower aount. If however you are not agreeable to that, I suggest you and I have a word on the
telephone to discuss before any next steps.

Thanks

Ben
