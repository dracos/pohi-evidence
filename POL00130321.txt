two Horizon incidents
Receipts Payments.zip
Inital report from Gareth LocalSuspense .docx

Please find attached documentation regarding the two incidents discussed.

The zip file contains information about the “receipts payments” problem — which impacted 64 branches. Please read
these as live documents at the time rather than a summary written two years after the event.

The second report explains a second incident regarding the “local suspense” account. This is current, the document
was prepared by Gareth to explain the problem to Post Office.

To me the important point is that the incidents were detected, resolved, and we communicated the problem to sub
postmasters. The other reassuring thing to me is that before we understood there was a defect, our support people
took the view to write off the losses (in the cases where there were losses) as they didn’t have any concrete evidence
that the branch had done anything wrong.

I will call on Monday to discuss further after you have had time to digest.
