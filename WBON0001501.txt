Rob

Forgive me for this short e mail. I am not pushy enough to seek to barge into Lord Grabiner's Sunday direct.

Could we do the following:

- Can you please send the attached draft note to Lord Grabiner QC ? It is not hugely long. The operative
parts of the note are 4 sides of text. The balance of the Word Doc' are selected quotes from the CIT
Judgment which make it seem longer than it really is.

- What POL is seeking here from Lord Grabiner is a broad "yes that is OK" to the note (assuming he does
so agree), not detailed comment (although if Lord Grabiner wishes to comment, he is welcome to). POL
want the broad "ok" so the Board of POL have confidence that Lord Grabiner does not disagree with the
direction set out. You see the two places in highlight in the body of the note where I say "Lord Grainger
has reviewed and ok’ea" etc. if that comes to pass I'll take those out of highlight and finalise the note.

- Ifthe OK/comment could come today — all well and good. If tomorrow then earlier the better as the note
will go to the Board in advance of the call tomorrow afternoon.

- Onto housekeeping matters:

o. Yes please to a call with Lord Grabiner at some point after 1.30 tomorrow. Please let me know
what time would suit best. That call would be with Jane (GC at POL) and me. That is so Jane can
get Lord Grabiner's views which she can then transmit to the Board. Would David C QC need to
be on that call too for detail and continuity purposes ? That could be sensible but we'll be guided
by Lord Grabiner.

o On the 5.15pm call for the POL Board, Lord Grabiner QC cannot make that time and I understand
the call time cannot move. I think Lord Neuberger could dial in at 5.15pm. Could you see if
that is in fact possible ? Please let me know as soon as you can in regard so I can update Jane.

o Should David C QC be on the 5.15 call too for background and detail ? Again, let us know.

o Jane is keen to stress that the POL Board want to hear from each of Lords Neuberger and
Grabiner directly and candidly on the recusal issue so if David C QC is there it is for background
specifically as the POL Board do want the views of "new voices”. I'll speak to David about that
too and he will understand I am sure, but I wanted to set that out here for the sake of clarity so we

are all in the same position.

MANY MANY thanks for your help.

Andy tells me West Ham did well yesterday...one day I'll tell you my one and only "football" story...you'll have guessed

it is not my thing...which frustrates Andy...

Rob/Tom,

I agree with David Neuberger’s approach and I support the recusal application proposal. I could speak

tomorrow but not at 5.15 for about an hour because of a prior commitment.

Regards,
Tony

Lord Grabiner QC

Rob
Sorry for all this contact over the weekend...
T have had an e mail from the client at Post Office and they say:

Ideally, I would like to know today whether Lord Grabiner is supportive of the recusal application, and if so,
to what extent. Are we able to get any insight on that? Provided that he is, then we should stand up Lord
Neuberger for the Board call, and I will also be able to feedback the outcome of the meeting with Lord
Grabiner. (which could be any time from 1.30 onwards that suits him).

So I think the following issues arise:

1) Is Lord Grabiner able to indicate today (e mail to you is fine and then you copy onto me — or direct to me
and Andy (copied)) if he is in broad agreement with the statement that he is supportive of a recusal
application needing to be made in this case and it having prospects of success. I think POL is seeking to
flush out whether lord Grabiner is broadly supportive, as Lord Neuberger was in his note, or whether he
takes a different view. If both are aligned, then there is a POL Board decision to be taken. If there is a
difference of view then we (POL and WBD) will have to think about how to guide the POL Board.

2) Assuming Lord Grabiner is in agreement broadly, then can POL GC (Jane MacLeod) and I get a call set
up after 1.30pm on Monday at a time that suits Lord Grabiner ? Jane wants to get a download so that can be
replayed to the later POL Board meeting.

3) The POL Board meeting is at 5.15pm. Lord Grabiner cannot make that. If there is broad agreement
between Lord Grabiner and Lord Neuberger then the plan would be for Lord Neuberger to be on a call with
the POL Board at that 5.15pm time slot. Can that be set up ?
