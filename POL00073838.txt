     supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of the information or cannot be
     traced. As part of my duties, I have access to these records.


Horizon System Helpdesk and National Business Support Centre


4.   An important element of the support provided to subpostmasters and Counter
     Clerks is the Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH). The HSH is the Horizon user's first
     'port of call' in the event of their experiencing a problem with the Horizon system
     or requiring advice and guidance. If the system were to malfunction, upon
     discovery Horizon users (Post Master, Counter Clerk) would raise a call to the HSH
     seeking clarification or advice. Comprehensive processes and procedures exist to
     manage the receipt, analysis and final disposition of calls made to the HSH. All
     calls to the HSH are captured by the Audit Server and stored as part of the overall
     Audit Trail . HSH is a service run by Fujitsu for the Post Office.


5.   The Post Office also provides a service to subpostmasters and Counter Clerks
     called the National Business Support Centre (NBSC). This has a helpline which
     subpostmasters can call to try to resolve any business related queries.


6.   I have been asked to provide details and confirmation on the reports that monitor
     faults, polling failures, equipment failures and calls for advice and guidance
     logged by the Horizon System Helpdesk recorded during the period December
     2003 to April 2004 for the Marine Drive branch - FAD Code 213337.


Tivoli Event Logs


7.   Horizon operates under the Microsoft Windows NT operating system. In this
     operating system        event is any significant occurrence in the system or in an
                        an




     application that requires users to be notified. For critical events such as a server
     breakdown or an interrupted power supply, there may be an Alert message on a
     control screen. For many other events that do not require immediate attention,
     this operating system adds information to an event-log file to provide information
     without disturbing normal work. This event logging service starts automatically
     each time a computer running Windows NT is started. In the Horizon system
     these events are collected by the Tivoli Event Monitor and are captured by the
     Audit Server and stored as part of the overall Audit Trail.



Non Polling Reports



8.   A daily report is produced that lists those branches that have not polled for 24
     hours, and the number of days they have been 'out of contact'. Polling : Branches

     are `contacted' periodically by the Correspondence Layer (where all transactions
     for all branches are stored prior to despatch to other systems) to deposit and
     collect information pertinent to that branch. This reduces the telephony costs
     incurred were branches to be permanently connected to the Correspondence
     Layer. Branches can operate in a disconnected state for up to 27 days.



HSH Call Logs



9.   The Tivoli Event Logs and Non Polling Reports for the period December 2003 to
     April 2004 are contained in the call logs at pages [ I.                      [Ann is this correct, or
     are these different from the attached logs?]                     Details of the calls and an
     overview of them is set out in date order below:



10. 9    December 2003, 9.54am, call                reference                                    The sub-




                                                                   e-0312090261
     postmaster had a power blip following which, the keyboard was not accepting the
     PMMC card, which is used by sub postmasters to               onto their terminal . The Post
                                                            log




     Master was advised to reboot his terminal. He rebooted, inserted his PMMC/pin
     and was happy to continue. The call was then closed.



11. 20 January 2004, 2.05pm, call reference e-0401200574 - this is a log
     simply to record that there was an ASDL update from ISDN [please explain
     what ASDL and ISDN stand                      This was a scheduled visit to the Marine
                                       for].




     Drive branch to install_; broadband.           The upgrade was completed, but the
     broadband was not turned on at that time.



12. 28 January 2004, '11.13am, call reference e-0401280325 - the call was
     taken by Dane Meah at HSH from the caller who stated that there were
     discrepancies going through the system for three weeks in a row. The caller was
     advised that the problem would need to be thoroughly investigated by the
     National Business Support Centre (NBSC) before the issue could be investigated
     because a software problem and the caller was transferred to the NBSC and the
     call closed.



13. 29 January 2004, 10.26am, call reference e-04012903568 - a call was
     taken by Mary Rainbow at HSH. The sub-postmaster reported that he was having
     problems on his system connected to remittances (REMs). The Sub-postmaster
     has to enter a remittance when he receives a delivery of new stock.                         He stated
     that every time he entered in the new stock, it left him with a discrepancy. The

     Sub Post master was transferred to the NBSC, since this was a business issue and
     the call was closed.



14. 2 February 2004, 8.49am, call reference e-0402020111 - Ben Horseman at
     HSH took a call from Cath at NBSC who stated that terminal (node) 2 had failed
     to initialise and that he also has "operational integrity violation has been
     detected" and "unable to connect to the repost service". The Post Master was
     advised that he would be called back whilst the counter is reviewed.



15. Both counters had been upgraded with ADSL (Broadband). The Sub-postmaster
     called back at 9.18am and was advised to reboot. It was recommended that an
     engineer swap or adjust the base unit on terminal 2. At approximately 3.30am,
     the PCs do a refresh [what does this mean?] and occasionally this can cause an
     installation failure.   An un-operational integrity violation points to a refresh not
     starting up properly.      An engineer was sent out to sort out the base unit and
     node. The engineer arrived on site at 1.30pm, replaced the node and the call was
     closed.



16. 13 February 2004, 10.41am, call reference e-0402130261 - call was taken
     by John Lockyear at HSH.        The sub-postmaster had stated that he had a rem
     issue and this was referred to NBSC. The call was then closed.



17. 13 February 2004, 10.46am, call reference e-0402130267 - this call was
     taken by Tony Law at HSH, referred from Marie at NBSC. The sub-postmaster
     had stated that his system was doubling up cash declarations and cutting off
     cheques, yet they still apparently appeared the next day. NBSC advised that they
     had checked that he was cutting everything off properly and that the catch figures
     were being done correctly. The sub-postmaster had insisted on a system check
     being carried out.      He said that the problem had been happening for five weeks
     and that every time stock had been remmed in, they had a loss that night. The
     sun -postmaster also stated that the cheques he had recorded on the 10 ,11 were
     showing on the 11u1 February as well .



18. The call was escalated to Heather Dryden at HSH.             As a sub-postmaster is
     supposed to send cheques to the EDS Processing Centre each evening, the next
     day you would expect to see the cheque figures cleared to zero on the Horizon
     system. The sub-postmaster, initially stated that this had happened more than
     once, but when Heather went through his cheques, it had happened just the once.
     It appears that the sub-postmaster forgot to cut off and the cheque listing had

                                                                                                           POL00073838




     two days worth of cheques in it. There is no option to cut off retrospectively ie if
     the sub-postmaster reveals that he has not cut off the previous days cheques,
     they will show up the next day and a failure to cut off previously cannot be
     corrected later. However, the point is that the system will not put the cheques in
     the balance and process them twice.          It will reconcile each cheque against the
     transaction.



19. 16 February 2004, 8.32am, call reference e-0402160081 - David Lawrence
     at HSH took a call from Marie at NBSC. The sub-postmaster had called NBSC to
     state that both his terminals were at Post Office Log On (POLO), but were
     rebooting ok subsequently. The call was therefore closed.



20. 16 February 2004, ii.12am, call reference                                          - Tony Law took




                                                                       e-0402160628
     a call from Pat at NBSC. The sub postmaster had stated that he needed an OBCS
     check. This is the bar code reader that each sub postmaster has at their terminal
     and was used for pension books. The OBCS was checked and the results given
     [do we know what the result was?]. The call was then closed.



21. 25 February 2004, 11.03am, call reference                                         - A call was taken
                                                        e-0402250454




     by Mary Rainbow. The clerk reported that they had been having problems on the
     system with balancing that week, which seemed to be related to stock being
     remmed in through the week. The clerk reported that over the past 7 weeks,
     they have had losses every week and at one point they had a problem with cash
     on hand, but they found that this was an issue with ID numbers that had been
     resolved. The           also reported that last week when they rolled over they put a
                     clerk




     loss into the suspense account and then took the computer terminal back to the
     trial balance which came out with a zero net discrepancy to start the new week
     with. The clerk reported that she had printed out a balance snapshot on Monday
     and that looked OK, but since then they had remmed in some stock which
     appears to have given them a loss.



22. The clerk was advised that she would need to check her stock position for last
     week and then check her reins in summary. This would show the stock that she
     should be holding and that figure could be compared with the stock showing in
     the adjust stock [what does this mean?] and this would highlight any problems
     with the stock on hand. The clerk was advised that we would need her to take
     her computer terminal to trial balance this evening and come back to us before
     she rolls over so that we can take down any details she can give us. The clerk
     confirmed that they are working on a shared stock unit and would call back if

                                                                                               POL00073838
                                                                                             POL00073838




     further assistance was required.         The balance sheet would show the old
     discrepancy until they can do a trial balance. The call was then closed.



23. 25 February 2004, 12.03pm, call reference e-0402250553 - a call was taken
     by Robert Congerton. [Is he at the NBSC?]. The clerk had told the NBSC she
     had problems regarding the balance. The NBSC were advised that HSH had told
     the PM to call back tonight when they had a net discrepancy on the cash account.
     The call was then closed.



24. 25 February 2004, 12.12pm, call reference e-0402250565 - Call was taken
     by Nicola Goodson at HSH. Jane at the NBSC had a call In relation to a call that
     had been closed.



25. 25 February 2004, 4.56pm, call reference e-0402251011- Call was taken by
     Niall Vincent, because a critical event was seen stating "error message. An error
     has occurred = see the audit log".        This call was not generated by the sub-
     postmaster calling the help desk, but by the System Management Centre (SMC)
     which automatically triggers a call when there is an unusual event. The call was
     referred to the SSC [what does that stand for?],           the SMC closed their call.
                                                           so




26. 25 February 2004, 5.33pm, call reference e-0402251077 - Call was taken
     by Kuljinder Bhachu at HSH. The sub-postmaster reported that the branch was
     getting, large discrepancies for the past few weeks.           The closed calls were
     reviewed and it was noted that a number of calls had been logged regarding
     discrepancies and that the NBSC had been in contact with the sub-postmaster
     could not find any user error. Kuljinder spoke to Sandra at NBSC. They checked
     the            events and the system appeared to be OK. Given that a critical event
           Tivoli




     had been noted earlier that day, the event logs were downloaded for review. The
     sub-postmaster advised that the problem had started ever since the BT engineer
     came to move the BT box for preparation for the installation of the ADSL.
     Kuljinder recommended that SSC investigate why the sub-postmaster is
     experiencing large discrepancies. A known error log (KEL) reference was given
     and the problem was re-assigned within HSH to group EDSC1 [what does this
     stand for?].



      At this point I investigated the matter. The critical event earlier that day was
     part of a storm ie       a central problem causing lots of event storms which had
     occurred over the entire Horizon system that night as a result of a faulty software
     fix. The KEL had nothing to do with the discrepancies.

                                                                                          POL00073838




27. Various built in checks occur at the end of each day. For example, the gate way
     terminal will total all the transactions. The gate way terminal will only send in
      information from these built in checks, once all the terminals in the branch have
     communicated with it.      Reports are only produced if there are discrepancies. A
     weekly cash account is produced and sent to the data centre.          The gate way
     terminal will do daily cash accounts. This is summarised weekly and compared to
     the weekly branch cash account to check for discrepancies. The data centre also
      produces a weekly cash account which is compared to the branch weekly cash
     accounts. There are therefore effectively three weekly cash accounts:

     a)     The branch weekly cash accounts;

     b)     The branch daily accounts, which is accumulated at the weekend; and

     c)     The data centre weekly cash account.



28. I checked the discrepancies between these three accounts and found none.
     Cheques were handled correctly (as far as the system was concerned). I also
     checked the rems were correct which they were apart from one day when the
     sub-postmaster forgot to cut off the cheques. I also noticed that occasionally the
     sub-postmaster's identification declaration number was used incorrectly. For
     example if a sub-postmaster uses number 01 and enters Â£10,000 and then
     changes their number and uses 11 to record it elsewhere, the system will think
     that the branch has Â£20,000 whereas it only has Â£10,000. The clerks used 2
     declaration numbers for daily cash handling, but this would not affect the weekly
     balance. I went throughÂ°the transactions day by day and compared them with the
            night declarations. I expected to find:
     over




     a)     Starting cash position;

     b)     Transaction; and

     c)     A system cash figure which should be close to the actual cash holding.



29. I was surprised to discover that at the end of the day, the cash the branch
     declared in the drawer was tens, hundreds or thousands of pounds stray from
     what they had recorded on the system. This meant that it was possible that the
     sub-postmaster was not accurately recording all transactions on the system,
     although if that had been the case, an error notice or error notices would have
     been generated to explain the discrepancy.



30. There was no evidence whatsoever of any system problem. I therefore asked
      HSH to revert to the sub-postmaster and explain that we have investigated and

                                                                                          POL00073838




     the discrepancies are caused by the difference between the transactions they
     have recorded on the system and the cash they have declared and are not being
     caused by the software or hardware.



31. 4 March 2004, 8.42am, call reference e-0403040165 - A call was taken by
     Hayley Minnis, a HSH retail line manager. The caller reported discrepancies in the
     office and was advised to speak to NBSC about this, since it was not a HSH issue.
     The call was then closed.



32. 4 March 2004, 11.28am, call reference e-0403040524- A call was taken by
     Elspeth Neilson. The sub-postmaster's line manager stated that the sub-
     postmaster was getting large discrepancies. They were advised that the
     discrepancies are caused by the difference between the transactions they have
     recorded on the system and the cash they have declared and are not being
     caused by the software or hardware. The cats was then closed.



33. 23 March 2004, 11.44pm, call reference e-0403230583 - Call was taken by
     Jacqueline Wilcock at HSH. The auditor wanted to know when the base unit had
     been exchanged at the Marine Drive branch. They were advised that it was
     exchanged on 2 February 2004. The call was then closed.



34. 23 March 2004, 2.20pm, call reference e-0403230628 - Call was taken by
     David Dawe at HSH. Brett from the NBSC asked for a One Shot Password (OSP)
     for the auditor. An OSP is issued so that the auditor can log on to the sub-
     postmaster's system. An OSP was given and the call was closed.



35. 1 April 2004, 12.45pm, call reference e-0404010718 - A call was taken by
     Adam Goldstein at HSH. The new sub-postmaster stated that the screen had
     frozen. A check was carried out which showed the events were normal [what
     does this mean?] and the sub-postmaster was advised to reboot. The call was
     then closed.



36. 19 April 2004, 9.57am, call reference e-0404190387 - A call was taken by
     Elspeth Neilson at HSH. The Retail Line Manager (RLM) stated that there had
     been discrepancies on the system since the base unit was swapped in February
     and wanted to know why. The RLM was advised that events appeared to be
     normal and that a health check had been passed. The sub-postmaster was happy
     to continue unassisted. The RLM stated that the new sub-postmaster had been in

       the office and there had not been any discrepancies in the balance. The RLM was
       advised to contact NBSC for advice on balancing. The call was closed.



37. 21 April 2004, 9.10am, call reference e-0404210187 - A call was taken by
        David Dawe. The sub-postmaster stated that the gateway was saying to enter the
        PMMC and that the screen had been blue for 10 minutes. The sub-postmaster had
       to wait for the screen to clear. The sub-postmaster was told to wait for 20
       minutes and as that screen was normal and the sub-postmaster was told to call
       back if this had not changed within the next 20 minutes. The call was then
       closed.



38. 21 April 2004, 1.32pm, call reference e-0404210701 - A call was taken from
        Bernard Michael at SMC. This was an SMC call                              related to a software upgrade.




                                                                     and
       It was when ADSL (broadband), that had been installed in 20 January 2004, was
       actually switched on. The call was then closed once the switch over to ADSL had
       been successful.



39. 23 April 2004, 3pm, call reference e-0404230660 - A call was taken by
       Jason Lockyear. The sub-postmaster wanted to                                 if he could get a list of his
                                                                           know




       calls and of software. The sub-postmaster was advised to contact NBSC for a full
       list and the call                  then
                                   was




                                                   closed.




Conclusion



40. There are no reasonable grounds for believing that the information stored on the
        Horizon system would be inaccurate because of improper use of the computer
       terminal. To the best of my knowledge and belief, during the material time, the
        Horizon system was operating properly at the Marine Drive branch or if not, any
       respect in which it was not operating properly was not such as to affect the
       production of audit record or accuracy of their contents.




I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.
