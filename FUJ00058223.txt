2 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Programme Status Live Outlets Operational Counters

Comments
In order to comply with the requirement to issue the first version of the SRB by 5"" working day of the

month, the ‘up to date’ figures for TPS, APS and OBCS file delivery cannot be obtained for the previous
month. This is due to Data Warehouse processing cycles and the effects of late polling. This subsequent
version contains updated TPS, OBCS and APS file delivery performance measures, which now reflect the
true position at the end of March.

2. Engaged call statistics have now been received from BT and included.

3._A detailed explanation and action plan for all SLA failures is included within section 4.9.

Comments

Performance Summary

88.4% of calls were answered within 4o seconds.
92.2% of calls were abandoned through ring-off.
95.5% of calls were engaged.

Cause and Action

Whilst there has been improvement in performance with
regard to ‘Calls abandoned through ring-off and ‘Calls
engaged’, ‘Calls answered within 40 seconds’ has seen a dip.
This aligned with a gradual reduction in performance against
‘Calls answered within 20 seconds’ has prompted ICL
Pathway to review the detail of the manpower model for the
HSH. This review is currently ongoing. In the meantime extra
resource is being drafted in to ensure continued conformance
for ‘Calls answered with 20 seconds’ and improved
performance for the other service levels.

Performance Summary

41 HSHD - Level 1 calls resolved within 5 minutes
HSHD - Level 2 calls resolved within 45 minutes

87.7% of Level 1 calls were resolved within 5 minutes.
98.1% of Level 2 calls were resolved within 45 minutes.

Cause and Action

New outlets are being added to the live estate at 300+ per
week and our initial analysis of the call text would suggest in
many cases that a number of calls are taking longer to resolve
due to Clerk / PM unfamiliarity with the system.

It is worth noting however that during March the average
duration of Li & L2 calls was:

Li=3 mins. 54 seconds

L2 = mins. 30 seconds

We are currently embarking on a detailed analysis of all Li &
L2 calls taking each weeks newly rolled out offices over a
defined period, (thought initially to be 12 weeks), to identify
the average call duration falling over the 12 week period. This
will give comfort in the knowledge that once the roll out
programme has been completed, call duration will fall to an
acceptable level against all outlets.

In the meantime, we are ensuring all HSH TSA’s are aware of
the need to resolve A&G calls quickly and effectively without
compromising customer service.

81.3% of priority B calls were resolved within 8 hours and
88.4% of calls were resolved within 10 hours.

Remote
70% of Priority B calls were resolved in 12 hours

Cause and Action

A number of actions have been taken in the last three weeks
to attempt to define the root cause of our being unable to
meet these SLA’s and to improve the processes surrounding
call resolution.

Unfortunately over the last few months there have been a
number of software issues, which have manifested
themselves as hardware failure, especially true with regard to
screens and printers. This has caused the HSH 1 and 2"! line
to become over cautious and therefore to review all hardware
call symptoms against the ‘Known Error Log’ (KEL) before
passing the call to Field Engineering, thus creating an
unacceptable delay.

In order to resolve this issue a number of actions have been

taken:

1. The HSH 2™ line has been tasked to allocate dedicated
resource to handle all hardware calls and thus speed up
the process of diagnosis.

2. Field Service themselves have been reviewing calls in the

2 Jine ‘call stack’ and taking calls directly from the stack
if, in their opinion, a site visit is thought appropriate.

3. With the experience currently obtained within the field
we are attempting to produce an easy guide for each
hardware product. This should allow the 1* line to readily
identify hardware calls and therefore allocate them direct
to Field Service without the need for all calls to be
reviewed by 2" line.

4. We have now convened a weekly ‘Field Service / HSH
Forum’ to discuss and review process failures where
actions are placed to resolve the issues.

We have now taken on dedicated resource to further

diagnose the route cause of each failure, by analysing each

call in detail. This will define the process changes that are
required or further enforcement of the process flow.

Performance Summary

99.71% of RDMC Reference Data was delivered by Day D.

Cause and Action

Calculation of this SLA is based upon the delivery of ‘Core’
reference data to all outlets on a daily basis, The ‘Non Polled’
outlet report is used to identify when an outlet has failed to
return an ‘End of Day’ (EOD) marker to the Data Centre. If

this is the case, the outlet is assumed to have not received a

delivery of reference data. This method of calculation weighs
heavily in the direction of POCL as we cannot determine
whether or not the outlet has received this data prior to any
communication problem preventing an EOD, the assumption
therefore is that it has not.

CSR+ sees this SLA being calculated automatically to counter
level.

Data Services - APS Reference Data Delivery by
Day D

Performance Summary
99.78% of APS Reference Data was delivered by Day D.

Cause and Action

Calculation of this SLA is based upon the delivery of APS
reference data to all outlets ONE day per month. The ‘Non.
Polled’ outlet report is used to identify when an outlet has
failed to return an ‘End of Day’ (EOD) marker to the Data
Centre. If this is the case, the outlet is assumed to have not
received a delivery of APS reference data. This method of
calculation weighs heavily in the direction of POCL as we
cannot determine whether or not the outlet has received this
data prior to any communication problem preventing an
EOD, the assumption therefore is that it has not.

Data Services - APS File Delivery by Day D

Performance Summary
99.68% of APS transaction files were delivered by Day D.

Cause and Action
Failure of this SLA is entirely attributable to ‘Non Polling’.

We are now working closely with POCL with the aim of:

1. Driving down the instances of non polling due to comms
failures.

2. Driving down the instances of non polling due to counter
switch off at the outlet

3. Mitigating the risk to POCL clients / customers in the
event of APS transactions failing to poll by reviewing the
escalation process and documentation retrieval from the
outlet.

N.B. APS transactions that have been delivered to HAPS after

Performance Summary
43 Data Services - OBCS Stops List by Day D 99.92% of OBCS Stops List files were delivered by Day D.

Cause and Action

Calculation of this SLA is based upon the delivery of OBCS
stop list data to specific outlets on a daily basis. The ‘Non
Polled’ outlet report is used to identify when an outlet has
failed to return an ‘End of Day’ (EOD) marker to the Data
Centre. If this is the case, the outlet is assumed to have not
received a delivery of OBCS stop list data. This method of
calculation weighs heavily in the direction of POCL as we
cannot determine whether or not the outlet has received this
data prior to any communication problem preventing an
EOD, the assumption therefore is that it has not.

Data Services - OBCS File Delivery by Day D

Performance Summary
94.28% of OBCS transaction files were delivered by Day B.

99.79% of OBCS transaction files were delivered by Day D.

Cause and Action

Failure of the Day B SLA can be attributed to the non delivery
of data to BA for transactions completed on 9"" March.

This failure was due to the BA data centre at Washington
being closed for 36 hours over the period, therefore no data
files were accepted.

Failure of the Day D SLA is entirely attributable to ‘Non

Polling’

We are now working closely with POCL with the aim of:

1. Driving down the instances of non polling due to comms
failures.

2. Driving down the instances of non polling due to counter

Training Services - Training Course Timeliness
Live Delivery

Implementation Services

Performa: Summary
99.6% of training courses were delivered in the required time

(ie. within five days of the Horizon system being in Live
operation in the Outlet).

Cause and Action

This failure was caused by ‘Knowledge Pool’ cancelling 1
course in this month. This was due the power at the hotel
being cut off following a road accident. The delegates were
re-scheduled on different courses.

Approximately 20 staff were given training prior to the
contractual training window. All these cases were agreed
with the delegate (and many were at the delegate’s request).
Authorisation for 5 of these was sought from ICL Pathway
and POCL. Control of this has been tightened up, and we
expect this figure to drop.

This situation will be resolved by next month.

Performance Summary

The data required for the calculation of these SLA’s is
currently unavailable from both POCL, for the ‘Quality’
derived measures and from ICL Pathway for the ‘Repair’
measures. The provision of this data has now been escalated
as a high priority task within ICL Pathway and we expect to
have some initial figures for discussion at the May 2000 SRF
in respect of April 2000 performance.

4.8 I Business Incident Management

Performance Summary
97.9% of business incidents were cleared within 5 working

days of receipt. (The definitions of ‘cleared’ being that
sufficient detail was supplied to POCL to allow reconciliation
or client settlement to take place).

Three Business Incidents did not achieve this SLA:

1. Ref: 0003201015: Receipts and Payments (post migration).
This was a new problem that took some time to resolve as
each individual line of the Cash Account required
checking to the message store. A revised Cash Account
was produced and sent to POCL TIP.

2. Ref: 0003130820: A transaction contained an invalid
transaction mode. Reference data checks against all
transaction modes took some time to complete with the
resulting resolution occurring 1 day outside the SLA.

3. Ref: 00033130910: This was a Customer / Client enquiry.
This case took a while to resolve as there was some
dispute with the PM as to whether a reversal had taken
place. The PM initially denied this to be the case,
necessitating a full check of the message store, however
our investigations subsequently proved otherwise. The
incident was finally cleared one day outside the SLA.
