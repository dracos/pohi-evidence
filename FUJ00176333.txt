IMBOCORO3 failed during a re-boot on the 14th June 2008. The machine was out of action until 2nd July when it was brought back
into service.

[throughout the 2nd July there appears to have been repeated problems with available disk space, presumably due to the large
number of messages being replicated from Wigan.

[the normal flow of Audit files was re-established on 5th July 2008.

initial checks suggest that messages originating at the counters for this period have been replicated from Wigan to Bootle, and
subsequently appear in the MBOCORO3 audit files, and that the gaps identified relate to messages originating at the call centres.

[this is probably due to the differences in the Correspondence servers retention periods for messages (42 days for counter
messages, 4 days for data centre messages) -

thorough check is being conducted to confirm this, and to identify all gaps. Once completed the same checks will be applied to
the corresponding Wigan files for this period to confirm that no data has been lost

ur first priority here is to ensure a backup copy of all the data which is missing on one side or the other.
[this PEAk should remain as an A priority until this is done.

fter that we will need to devise a method to inject the data to the hardware where it is missing. This can be done under a lower
priority.

It am projecting a date for the first part of ths solution only, i.e. I am providing a traget date at which this PEAK may be
jreduced in priority.
