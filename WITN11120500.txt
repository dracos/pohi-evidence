THE POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

Fifth Witness Statement of Rachel Scarrabelotti

on behalf of Post Office Limited in the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

1. 1, Rachel Scarrabelotti, of 100 Wood Street, London, EC2V 7ER, say as follows:

2. lam Company Secretary at Post Office Limited ("Post Office"). I joined Post Office
in March 2022 and was appointed as Company Secretary effective 12 April 2022.
This is my Fifth Witness Statement to the Inquiry. The purpose of this witness
statement is to correct and clarify a point I made in my second witness statement

[WITN11120200] dated 16 February 2024 ("my second witness statement").

3. In my second witness statement I said as follows at paragraph 60:

"60. In keeping with the aim of continuous governance improvement, NomCo has
approved the reduction in the number of the CEO’s executive reports and the
membership of the executive management group has accordingly been reduced
from eight members to five members, being the CEO, CFO, Chief Technology
Officer, Deputy CEO and Chief People Officer. This change has been made in
response to the preliminary feedback received via the GT report with a desire

to improve the speed of decision-making at the senior level. In addition, a

cohort of approximately 25 employees (including all immediately prior executive
direct reports of the CEO) will form a new senior leadership group." [Emphasis

added]

. At the time of writing my second witness statement, I had understood that this
restructuring of the executive had been prompted by preliminary feedback from
Grant Thornton ("GT"). However, following recent discussions with the Chief of
Staff at Post Office, Chrysanthy Pispinis, I have been advised that this restructuring
of the executive was in fact initiated following discussions between the CEO,
Deputy CEO, Chief People Officer and Chief of Staff as to alternative membership

of the executive management group.

. As such, it was incorrect to state that the change "has been made in response to
the preliminary feedback received via the GT report" and paragraph 60 of my

second witness statement should instead read as follows:

"60. In keeping with the aim of continuous governance improvement, NomCo has
approved the reduction in the number of the CEO’s executive reports and the
membership of the executive management group has accordingly been reduced
from eight members to five members, being the CEO, CFO, Chief Technology
Officer, Deputy CEO and Chief People Officer. I am told by the Chief of Staff that
the proposal for these changes originated from discussions between the
CEO, Deputy CEO, Chief People Officer, and Chief of Staff, taking place in
Parallel to the GT work, and resulting in the CEO's proposal to NomCo. In

addition, a cohort of approximately 25 employees (including all immediately prior
WITN11120500

executive direct reports of the CEO) will form a new senior leadership group."

[Emphasis added to highlight the change made.]
