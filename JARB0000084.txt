14 July - JNA and JKW thinking, but JNA fine to talk to Alan

11 July - Alan spoke to JKW. Working Group meeting this week has ended rather badly. Alan
feels that Second Sight's role is being changed as independent arbiters of whether cases ought
to proceed to mediation is being changed. Has spoken to Tony Hooper who has given Alan 2
weeks to make a case that Second Sight should be the decision maker as to whether or not
cases proceed to mediation. Alan wants to know JNA's views on what he and other MPs
believe Second Sight's role is.

At the moment, Second Sight investigates. At the end of the investigation, they make a
recommendation as to whether a case goes to mediation or not. This is then debated at
Working Group, where there are two votes, Post Office and JSFA. If the vote is split, then
Tony Hooper makes a decision.

Alan's point is that surely Second Sight's recommendation should be regarded as final, and that
not allowing this to be the case interferes with the independence of the process.
