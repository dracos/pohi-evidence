{am the person named above and I live at the address overleaf. I work at The Markets Crown Post Office®
Branch but from February through to September 2010 I was assisting in the Horizon Next Generation (HNG)
roll out programme.

On 2" September 2010 I attended Hightown Post Office® Branch as part of the HNG programme on behalf of
Post Office Ltd. This program changes Post Office® Branches from the old Horizon system to the new one.

The branch visits required a cash verification. That meant I had to count the actual cash on hand.

Prior to attending the branch I spoke to Miss Hall on the telephone and explained I would need to count the
cash. She then said that there was a problem with the cash as she had been having trouble with her lottery. I
visited the office the office in the afternoon and at the end of the day I listed the cash but did not add it up. The
following day before I attended I added the cash figures and realised there was a large discrepancy of over
£13,000

When I counted the cash with Miss Hall I discovered a discrepancy of £13,624.41

I wrote a record of our conversation on the reverse of the cash check sheet on which I listed the cash I counted
in the branch, Miss Hall signed it. I now produce the cash sheet as exhibit TB/O1 and the record of
conversation as TB/O2

I also produced the Balance snap shot as exhibit TB/O3

I would be willing to attend Court if necessary.

{am the person named above and I live at the address overleaf. I work for Post Office Ltd and my current role is

as Field Support Officer. As part of my role I undertake audits at Post Office® Branches.

On the 3rd September 2010, accompanied by my colleague Richard Cross, I conducted an audit of the above
named branch. The audit had been arranged as Tracey Bedford. Migration Support Officer, had found the cash
to be short by £13624.41 the previous day and had therefore closed the office pending our visit.

The purpose of this audit was therefore to verify financial assets due to the Post Office®.

The audit revealed a shortage in the branch of £14842.37. A breakdown of the audit result and details of the

audit findings are as follows:

€ 13577.34 (-) Identified as a difference in cash figures

£ 446.03 -) Identified as a difference in stock figures

£ 14023.37 (-) Total shortage on day of audit

£ Pending transaction correction, advised by Product & Branch Accounting on
819.00 io the day of the audit

£  14842.37 (-)___ Total shortage

We arrived at the branch at 13.00 pm and introduced ourselves to the Postmaster Miss Alison Hall and advised
that we were to perform an audit on behalf of Post Office Ltd.

Miss Hall allowed us access to the secure area, and was present in the secure area whilst the audit was carried
out.

Miss Hall said the loss had occurred due to Lottery accounting problems and produced a report from Lottery
Accounting Chesterfield detailing errors ( mainly activations on the Lottery terminal not all being remitted in on

the Horizon system ) going back 18 months. She had been accepting the Transaction Corrections, adjusting the
instants on hand back down to the correct figure but not putting any money in to compensate. The Trading
Statement copies printed (originals unreadable) all show a clear balance and Miss Hall stated these were
adjusted to show clear before rolling over. Cash declarations together with snapshots produced indicate ONCH
falsely declared for some considerable time.

A call to Chesterfield revealed further Transaction Corrections due for -£819.00 mainly for Instants not remitted
in. Three of these were found with no remittance advice attached to prove to Miss Hall the information supplied
was correct.

The audit was completed revealing numerous discrepancies to stock and stamps on the Horizon snapshot in
addition to the cash discrepancy. The audit loss on the day was £14,842.37 which together with the ammount of
£819.00 for Transaction Corrections pending brings the Trading Position deficit to £14,842.37.

Miss Hall was then advised that she should satisfy herself that the figures of the audit team were correct.
Therefore, we asked Miss Hall if she would do her own independent count of all the cash on hand again. She
said she had watched me count the cash and was happy the figure was correct.

Miss Hall then confirmed that the figures of the audit team were correct.

I now produce Branch Trading Statements as follows;

I am employed by Post Office Limited as an Agents Contract Manager (ACM) and I have held that position since
September 2008. I have been employed by the Post Office since December 1993. As an ACM, I cover a
number of Post Office® Branches within the north of England. One of those Branches is Hightown Post Office®
Branch WF15 8HU. An ACM is responsible for Contracts and Services at the Sub Post Offices under their control

and to ensure that standards and procedures at those offices comply with Post Office Ltd standards.

Mrs Sue Muddeman was the ACM in this case but she has since left Post Office Ltd.

From records held by Post Office Ltd I can say that Miss Alison HALL was appointed to the position of Sub
Postmaster at Hightown Post Office® Branch in February 2005 and was suspended from Post Office Ltd duties
on 3™ September 2010.

Miss Hall, as Sub Postmaster would be responsible for the day-to-day running of her Post Office® Branch,
including provision and maintenance of suitable premises and the employment of sufficient staff to maintain
adequate service requirements. She would be responsible for ensuring that Post Office Ltd services are provided
to the general public, for maintaining and summarising daily, weekly & monthly accounts in respect of the Post
Office® Branch transactions, and for preparing those accounts and despatching them on a daily, weekly or
defined periodical basis to the relevant accounting departments within the Post Office, and various agencies, such
as National Savings and Investments, The Department for Work and Pensions and Alliance & Leicester Girobank

etc.

also be entirely at the discretion of the Sub Postmaster.

Post Office Ltd within its Past Office® branches uses a computerised accounting system known as HORIZON in
Telation to the various types of transactions conducted over the counter and for the recording of daily, weekly and
monthly figures in relation to those transactions. The system is used by the operator to conduct all transactions
carried out at the counter and therefore the operator is able to view the extent of transactions conducted on a

daily basis as well as provide information as to the state of stock sold or received and cash received.

Post Office Ltd operates a system whereby all Sub Post Offices must bring to account all of the transactions
conducted over a four or five-week period, as well as declare the correct amount of cash and stock held at the
close of business at the end of this period. This process ultimately leads to the office producing a document
known as a ‘Branch Trading Statement’ for the defined four or five-week period. In practice, although the
requirement is only to praduce a Branch Trading Statement every four or five weeks, many Post Office®
Branches perform the exercise on a weekly basis for their own records; they do this without producing a final
Branch Trading Statement which is only required by Post Office Ltd, as stated every defined four or five-weeks.
The Post Office® accounting period always begins on a Thursday and runs through until a Wednesday, be that
through a required four or five-week period or just a local non required one week period. The term used
throughout the Post Office® community when referring to the practice of declaring the state of the office
accounts be it on a non-required weekly basis or a required four or five-week basis is ‘Balancing the office’ or

doing the ‘Balance’.

As previously stated, the accounting period for Post Office Ltd starts on a Thursday morning at which time the
actual cash and stock physically held on site is known and forms part of the starting figure used for accounting
purposes for that period. As the week progresses a large number of transactions are performed over the counter
with the general public, for instance if a customer purchases a first class stamp for 41 pence, the Post Office
counter provides the customer with a first class stamp (i.e. stock) and therefore the starting figure reduces by 41
pence in the stock portion, however, the customer hands the Post Office 41 pence in cash, this therefore inflates
the cash figure by 41 pence and brings the starting figure back to it's original state and a ‘balance’ is once again
established,

Other transactions are slightly different and accounted for slightly differently but the same principle stated above

applies. As an example, if a customer presents a £100 green Giro cheque to the Post Office Counter, as long as
all of the security procedures have been met, the counter clerk would hand the custorner £100 in cash, this
would deflate the office cash holding by £100, however, the green giro cheque for £100 would become a ‘paid
voucher’ and be held by the Post Office and ultimately would be used to balance the accounts at the end of the
week. Basically for every transaction carried out by the Post Office we either receive cash or cheques from the
customer and provide something for it, or we pay cash out to a customer for which we obtain some form of ‘paid

voucher’ i.e. green giro cheque, bank cheque etc. which remains within the Post Office and is accounted for.

The Horizon system keeps a running tally of all transactions conducted over the course of the balancing period
and the operator is able to request various reports from the systern at any time to display the current state of the
accounts, such as the cash on hand figure, or the number of Green Girocheques paid to date etc. These can be

viewed on the monitor or printed off.

On a Wednesday evening at the end of the four or five week period when the office balance is performed prior to
the production of the Branch Trading Statement, summaries for all the paid vouchers are requested from the
Horizon system. A physical check is made to ensure that all vouchers are present and that they have been
correctly entered onto the Horizon balancing system. The Horizon system is then interrogated to provide a
printout known as a ‘snap shot’ which gives a summary of all of the transactions performed during that balancing
period and a breakdown of all of the cash and stock which should be on hand having taken into account all sales
and receipts transacted by the system during that balancing period. The person who then carries out the task of
balancing merely has to verify all of the cash and stock on hand and input those figures into the Horizon system

which should then match the ‘snap shot’.

A balance is reached when the figures for both the payments and receipts are the same, any discrepancy in the
two figures would result in the office declaring a shortage or a surplus of cash in the accounts. Once the operator
is content with the office accounts, they are then required to finalise the Branch Trading Statement as being a
true reflection of the Post Office Account at that time. The Branch Trading Statement shows summaries of
transactions conducted that period together with the actual values of cash and stock to hand. A copy is sent
electronically to the Post Office Limited Accounting Centre and a hard copy is printed off the Horizon system,
signed by the Sub Postmaster as being a true record of the state of accounts of the office, and retained at the

I am the person named above and I live at the address overleaf. I work for Post Office Ltd and have done so for
16 years. My current role has me working as part of the Post Office Ltd Lottery Team. As part of my role I

have access to computer information regarding Lottery transactions made by our Post Office® Branches.

I was asked to look at records relating to Hightown Post Office® Branch's lottery. I could not find any large
discrepancies but found over the last two years we had issued the following amounts through Transaction
Corrections;

National Lottery Game: 03/04/2008 to date £1,052 (credit)

Prize payments: 24/04/2008 to date £190.20 (debit)

Scratchcards: 23/06/2008 to date £2,200 debit (stock credit)

Regular numbers of Scratchcard sales entries have been made. However, a high number of stock adjustments

have also been made. From 01/08/2008 to date 115 stock adjustments totalling £1,760 (credit).
If stock adjustments have been made irrplace of sales entries no commission is payable to the Postmaster.
National Lottery transactions are performed on dedicated terminals located within premises.

Scratchcards are received by the branches from Camelot and are initially scanned to inform Camelot they have
been received.

The scratchcards then needed for sale are scanned and the £s value is entered on to the Horizon system
manually.

At the end of each day the Lottery terminal will give details of Sales and prizes. These figures are manually

input in to the Horizon systern. At this point the cash must be physically added to the Post Office® till. In

I am the person named above and I live at the address overleaf. I am a Counter Clerk at Hightown Post
Office® Branch, Liversedge. I have worked at the branch for approximately four years. The Postmaster at the
time was Miss Alison Hall. I worked on the counter serving customers. At the time the branch used shared
stocks. My Horizon User ID was KLA 001. At this time I had a password but the postmaster and other staff

members knew it. This was because we used other people’s User Id if we needed to serve parcel customers.

During the first two weeks of August 2010 I ran the branch at Miss Hall was on leave. Before Miss Hall
finished she told me to add a figure in to the daily cash declaration. This was a figure that was written on the
top of the daily cash declarations. While Miss Hall was away on leave I did this. Then on Tursday I would have
to telephone the Post Office Ltd Cash Management team to request extra money ready for our Friday Delivery.
This was because the cash figures the branch were submitting on the cash declarations was inflated. Often we

would run short of money to serve customers.

Miss Hall told me she would sort the discrepancy on a number of occasions. During the two weeks I was
running the branch the daily lottery figures were fine and balanced. At the beginning of September 2010 a lady
from Post Office Ltd came to the branch to change the office over to the new Horizon system. Miss Hall had
already written down the cash and all that remained to count was in the drawer. The lady said she had to count
all the cash on hand. Miss Hall then said there was a problem. The branch then closed.

Miss Hall would usually leave the cash in the drawers overnight. Since the new postmaster has been running

the branch I have realised how poorly the branch was run by Miss Hall.

I would be willing to attend Court if necessary.
