Subject: : ight re Part 2 Preliminary
Attachments: DRAFT Letter to Second Sight re Part 2 Preliminary Comments 12082014.docx; Part Two - DRAFT.PDF

Jonathan,
Please find attached a revised

draft response to Second Sight’s Part Two report following Belinda, Andy and I speaking to them yesterday. I have also
attached the Part Two report for ease. This needs to reach Second Sight tomorrow so I would be grateful for
comments today/overnight which I will consolidate.

A few points to bear in mind:

The letter is a work in progress and we will continue to tighten the drafting overnight.

¢ Weill finalise who the signatory will be once we have finalised the content and tweak drafting accordingly.

e There will be a second stage of comment on the draft Second Sight report and it is at that stage we will send a
tougher letter if the draft does not significantly improve.

Many Thanks

David
