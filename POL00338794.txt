Alice

We have found the two reports by RM Internal Audit (with assistance from Deloittes) and Gartner Consulting.

Having looked at the Gartner report it is very technical and doesn't really deal with the integrity of the system, however
both reports are in the post today, to your Oxfordshire address.

I have a comment from Internal Audit regarding Deloittes' involvement which may be of interest

The preparatory field work relating to the report was carried out by the Royal Mail Internal Audit and Risk Management
team, which involved an IT expert seconded from Deloitte UK under an Outsourcing Agreement to assist in the review."

Just to let you know I have called a meeting on Monday so that we are ready with the information for your follow up
internal James Arbuthnot meeting on Wednesday, I am hopeful that I will be able to send something through on Tuesday
for pre-reading.

Thanks
Alwen
