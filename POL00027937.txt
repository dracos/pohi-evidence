SCHEDULE B4.4
EXISTING SERVICE LEVELS
INTRODUCTION

The provisions of this Schedule B4.4 shall apply to the HNG-X Services (other than
the BCSF Service) from the Amendment Date and shall cease to have effect on
commencement of the relevant Trigger Event as set out within the tables in
Schedule B3.1. For the purposes of determining which existing Service Levels are
affected upon the occurrence of such Trigger Event, Annex 6 to this Schedule B4.4
sets out each existing Service Level, as described in this Schedule B4.4, and its
corresponding Service Description.

This Schedule B4.4 defines up to three thresholds in respect of each Service Level
as follows:

1.2.1 the level of Service (“Service Level Target” or “SLT”) required from
Fujitsu Services by Post Office;

1.2.2 the level of Service which, if not achieved by Fujitsu Services, shall give
rise to payment of liquidated damages by Fujitsu Services (the
“Liquidated Damage Threshold” or “LDT”). Payment of liquidated
damages notwithstanding, a failure of any LDT shall not (on its own)
constitute a Default; and

1.2.3 the level of Service below the SLT and (if applicable) the LDT which if not
achieved by Fujitsu Services shall give rise to payment by Fujitsu
Services of Post Office Additional Costs or liquidated damages as
described (where relevant) in this Schedule (the “Additional Remedy
Level” or “ARL”).

For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that not all SLT failures shall give
rise to payment of liquidated damages. The SLT failures that do not give rise to
payment of liquidated damages are set out in each relevant Service Description
CCD.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The purpose of remedies (liquidated damages or any other additional remedy
specified in a Service Description) is that Post Office shall not be disadvantaged
by failures of Fujitsu Services to provide the Services to the agreed specification
and reliability.

3.1

For the avoidance of doubt, liquidated damages shall be based upon the applicable
fixed amounts or rates stated in this Schedule B4.4.

The performance of the Services against the SLT, LDT and ARL applicable in
respect of each Service Level shall be measured and reported and success or
failure against each shall be judged over Service Level Measurement Periods
defined for each Service. Additionally, all levels of service shall be monitored on a
weekly and monthly basis and any failure to meet a Service Level assessed over
that month shall be reported to Post Office by means of the Service Review Book
produced on a monthly basis detailing all Service Levels and the actual levels of
service achieved in that month.

In respect of any SLT that has a Service Level Measurement Period equivalent to
a SLT Calendar Year or a Service Level Measurement Period that is otherwise
defined with reference to a SLT Calendar Year, in the event that the remainder of
the term of the Agreement after the last SLT Calendar Year of the term of the
Agreement in relation to that SLT (“Final Period”) is less than six (6) months then
Fujitsu Services shall:

2.41 continue to measure and report performance against that SLT during the
Final Period; and

2.4.2 not be obliged to take any remedial action should that SLT fail to be
achieved at any time during the Final Period.

The values applicable to each SLT are set out in the Annexes to this Schedule
B4.4.

Subject to any provisions to the contrary in this Schedule B4.4 in respect of a
particular Service Level, where Service Levels are expressed in terms of

performance required by a particular “Day”:

2.6.1 “Day A” means the day of the specified triggering event (such as the date
of a Transaction);

2.6.2 “Day B” means the day following Day A; and
2.6.3 “Day C” means the day following Day B and so on.
SERVICE LEVELS

The Annexes to this Schedule B4.4 define the SLTs, LDTs and ARLs for the
following groups of Services:

3.1.1 Service Desk services (Annex 1);
3.1.2 Data Delivery services (Annex 2);

3.1.3 Banking services (Annex 3); and

SERVICE LEVEL RELIEF - VOLUMETRIC LIMITS

Annex 5 to this Schedule B4.4 sets out the limits for certain Operational Services
(the “Volumetric Limits”) which if exceeded over the period specified in the table
in Annex 5 (the “Relevant Period”) will entitle Fujitsu Services to adjust the
measurements of performance in respect of the Service Levels (SLTs and (if
applicable) the LDTs and ARLs) affected by that excess (the “Affected Service
Levels”). Such adjustment shall be made on the following basis:

4.14 if the Relevant Period for a Volumetric Limit is a calendar month and that
limit is exceeded, Fujitsu Services shall identify for joint consideration with
Post Office the days in that month on which the average daily volume
(based upon measurements of actual volumes over the previous three
months, or otherwise as agreed by the Parties (acting reasonably)) has
been exceeded and shall specify for joint consideration the reasons for
that excess if caused or contributed to by Fujitsu Services.

4.12 if the Relevant Period for a Volumetric Limit is a day and that limit is
exceeded, Fujitsu Services shall specify for joint consideration the reason
for that excess if caused or contributed to by Fujitsu Services.

4.1.3 for each day on which the average daily volume referred to in paragraph
4.1.1 or the Volumetric Limit referred to in paragraph 4.1.2 is exceeded:

(a) as a result of Default by Fujitsu Services, no adjustment shall be
made to the performance measurements for the Affected Service
Levels in respect of that day; or

(b) for any reason other than a Default by Fujitsu Services, the
performance measurements for the Affected Service Levels in
respect of that day shall be disregarded and replaced with an
average measurement for that day (based upon actual
performance measurements over the previous three calendar
months, or otherwise as agreed by the Parties (acting
reasonably).

Following each Service Level Measurement Period the Parties will assess
whether, on average, over the relevant Service Level Measurement Period any of
the Volumetric Limits has been exceeded by 10% or more. In making that
assessment the Parties shall consider the cause of any daily peaks in excess of
daily averages during that period, and disregard the measurements in respect of
those days where the peaks have arisen as a result of Fujitsu Services’ Default. If
having made such assessment, the Parties agree that a Volumetric Limit has been
exceeded by 10% (and in the case of monthly Volumetric Limits, those limits have
been exceeded in any three consecutive months), the Parties shall meet to discuss
and agree (acting reasonably) appropriate changes to the Volumetric Limits and
any change to the applicable Service Levels.

SERVICE LEVEL/OBLIGATION RELIEF - BUSINESS VOLUMES CCD

The CCD entitled “Horizon Capacity Management and Business Volumes”
(PA/PER/033) (the “Business Volumes CCD”) defines various limits on numbers
of Transactions or instances of Service as “Contracted Volumes” or “Design
Limits” for EPOSS, APS, LFS, Message Broadcast Service, Reference Data
Management Service, NBS, DCMoP and on-line Transactions.

On each day that any of the Contracted Volumes referred to in the Business
Volumes CCD is exceeded, the measures of Fujitsu Services' performance for the
Service Levels (SLTs and (if applicable) the LDTs and ARLs) listed in the Business
Volumes CCD shall be disregarded and replaced with an average measurement
for that day (based upon actual performance measurements over the previous
three calendar months, or otherwise as agreed by the Parties (acting reasonably)).

If the Contracted Volumes referred to in the Business Volumes CCD are exceeded,
Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall jointly consider the reasons for such excess
and whether it is temporary or is or is likely to be continuing. If such excess is or
is likely to be continuing Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to make a reasonable
and proportionate adjustment to the relevant Contracted Volume and/or the
affected Service Levels or obligations specified in the Business Volumes CCD,
such adjustment to be agreed with Post Office under the Change Control
Procedure.

If any of the Design Limits specified in the Business Volumes CCD are exceeded
then the measures of Fujitsu Services’ performance for any Service Level or other
service target involving data processing (requiring either automated or manual
processing or both) shall be disregarded to the extent that Fujitsu Services can
demonstrate to Post Office's satisfaction (Post Office acting reasonably) that
failure to meet the Service Level and/or service target, as the case may be,
occurred as a result of a Design Limit being exceeded. Fujitsu Services shall use
reasonable endeavours to meet those Service Levels and/or service targets during
the period when the measures of Fujitsu Services’ performance are disregarded.

OTHER SERVICE LEVEL/OBLIGATION RELIEF

The Parties shall agree (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld)
appropriate relief from Service Levels if any new facilities or products are
introduced, by agreement, with less testing than would otherwise be required to
safeguard Fujitsu Services’ position.

For the periods in which the NBS and/or any of the Horizon Applications (other
than NBS) or Infrastructure Services are suspended in accordance with paragraph
3.4.15 of the CCD entitled “Service Management - Service Description”
(SVM/SDM/SD/0007) (formerly “Service Management Service - Service
Description” (CS/SER/014)), measurements of Fujitsu Services’ performance in
respect of all Service Levels detrimentally affected by such suspension (in respect
of those Horizon Applications and Services) shall be disregarded and Fujitsu
Services shall be released from those of its obligations in respect of those Horizon

Applications and Services which it is unable to perform as a result of such
suspension.

If Fujitsu Services fails to achieve any Service Level or service target (as the case
may be) and can demonstrate to Post Office's reasonable satisfaction that such
failure occurred as a result of a fault or problem within the QAS Software, such
fault or problem requiring the Third Line Support Service or Application Support
Service (Fourth Line) in order to be resolved, then the measures of Fujitsu
Services’ performance in respect of such Service Level and other service target
shall be disregarded for the period affected by the QAS Software fault or problem.

RECTIFICATION PLAN

In the event that an ARL specified in this Schedule B4.4 is failed, Fujitsu Services
and Post Office shall agree a method of rectification and timetable for the
resolution of the cause of that failure (a “Rectification Plan”). For the avoidance of
doubt, Fujitsu Services shall remain liable for financial remedies payable in
accordance with this Schedule B4.4 in respect of that failure.

In the event that the Rectification Plan involves a change to the provision of the
Services, such change shall be agreed under the Change Control Procedure and
shall be made at no charge to Post Office.

Without prejudice to Post Office's rights to remedies provided in this Agreement,
during the period the Rectification Plan is being implemented Fujitsu Services shall
maintain performance of all other Services in accordance with the Service Levels
specified in this Schedule B4.4 unless otherwise agreed with Post Office as part
of the Rectification Plan.

In the event that the Rectification Plan is not agreed by the Parties (acting
reasonably) within three (3) calendar months of the occurrence of an ARL failure
or the Rectification Plan fails to resolve the cause of the ARL failure to which it
relates, such that the ARL failure occurs again and is persistent, the following
provisions shall apply:

7.4.1 Post Office shall have the right to conduct, and require Fujitsu Services
to co-operate and assist with, a tender process for sub-contracting by
Fujitsu Services of the Operational Services in relation to which the ARL
failure has occurred to an alternative service provider (the “Service
Provider’). If the Parties agree that it would be more appropriate for
Fujitsu Services to conduct, and Post Office to co-operate with, the tender
process, then the Parties shall procure the same.

7.4.2 Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, Fujitsu Services shall
disclose to any bona fide potential Service Provider (subject to the same
executing an Agreed Form NDA or any other form of non-disclosure
agreement mutually agreed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services and such
bona fide potential Service Provider) Confidential Information to the

Schedule B4.4 Version 13.0

POL00027937
POL00027937
CONFIDENTIAL

9.1

extent that such disclosure is reasonably required to enable any potential

Service Provider to prepare a reasonably detailed tender proposal.

7.4.3 If the outcome of any tender process is that Fujitsu Services were to sub-
contract the Operational Services in question to a Service Provider
identified in the tender process, the performance in respect of the failed
ARL for that Operational Service would be improved then Post Office
shall have the right to require Fujitsu Services to sub-contract such
Operational Service to such Service Provider at no higher cost to Post
Office than was previously the case.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Any dispute arising in connection with the application of this Schedule B4.4 shall

1.3 Where Fujitsu Services is obliged to arrange and undertake a visit to a Branch to recover
Transaction records as described in the CCD entitled “Engineering Service: Service
Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0002) in order to avoid the Day J Service Levels (SLTs and
LDTs) set out in this Annex 2 being failed (each a “Recovery Visit’), in assessing
whether there has been a failure of those Service Levels the following principles shall
apply:

1.3.1 For the purposes of such assessment, the following shall be disregarded from
all relevant Service Level measurements in respect of the Branches in
question:

Schedule B4.4 Annex 2 Version 12.0
Page 12 of 51
CONFIDENTIAL

(a) days on which Fujitsu Services has been unable to contact a Branch
(despite reasonable endeavours to do so) to arrange a Recovery Visit,
which includes days on which that Branch is not open for business;

(b) each day of delay caused by a Branch declining the earliest offered date
for a Recovery Visit (provided the Recovery Visit offered on that date
would not extend beyond the end of Post Office Core Day or, if later, the
normal business opening hours of that Branch), which includes days on
which that Branch is not open for business;

(c) each day of delay caused by a Branch cancelling, refusing or otherwise
preventing an arranged Recovery Visit but excluding days on which a

(d) each day that a Recovery Visit, which by prior arrangement with a Branch
is scheduled to take place or continue beyond the hours that Branch is
open for business, is prevented from being completed by that Branch
contrary to that arrangement.

For the purposes of such assessment, the period commencing on the day on
which Fujitsu Services becomes aware that a Branch does not have the PSTN
telephone capability or “plug-in” PSTN telephone capability required for a
Recovery Visit and ending on and including the day on which an ISDN or ADSL
connection is re-established to that Branch, shall be disregarded from all
relevant Service Level measurements in connection with the application of the
Service Levels in this Annex 2 to that Branch.

1.4 Fujitsu Services shall arrange and undertake Recovery Visits in order to achieve the
Day J Service Levels set out in this Annex 2, unless prevented from arranging such
visits or from undertaking them within Post Office Core Day or, if later, the normal
business opening hours of the Branch in question.

(i) the Transaction record file shall be deemed to be
delivered when it is delivered to the EDG and not the AP
Client; and

(ii) a successful Transaction record file delivery will be
deemed to have occurred when the file transfer software
running on the remote file transfer management service

EDG has occurred or cannot occur because of problems
within the EDG infrastructure.

Remedies

(a)

(b)

The liquidated damages for late delivery of APS Transaction Data Files
shall be calculated when the relevant LDT is breached as follows:

liquidated damages =

(((100 - actual level of Service by Day J) / 100) * total number of
Transactions * 1.46 pence) +

(((98.5 — (the greater of the ARL (98) and the actual level of Service
by Day D)) / 100) * (total number of Transactions - any also failing
at Day J) * 1.46 pence) +

QA/Test SAP System is used and expiring on the day on which the
Production SAP System becomes available and Fujitsu Services
has completed the loading of all data onto the Production SAP
System from the QA/Test SAP System;

(b) any failure to load any Transaction onto Configured POL FS where
such failure is caused either by:

(

ANNEX 3 TO SCHEDULE B4.4 - BANKING SERVICES

PART A - NBS SERVICE LEVELS AND REMEDIES

NBS SERVICE LEVEL PRINCIPLES

This Part A of Annex 3 to Schedule B4.4 specifies the SLTs and ARLs and the
performance measurements required in respect of them for the NBS. No LDTs are
specified for the NBS in this Annex, but liquidated damages shall be payable by Fujitsu
Services in accordance with paragraph 3 and 4 of this Annex 3.

For the purposes of this Annex 3:

“Availability Period” means each period of six (6) months commencing on 1 January
and 1 July each SLT Calendar Year;

“Central NB System” means the elements of the NB System which enable on-line
Banking Transactions to be carried out, excluding all:

1.2.1 such elements in Branches (or other Post Office locations where the NBS is
available);

1.2.2 network components between each Branch (or other Post Office locations
where the NBS is available) and the Data Centres; and

1.2.3 network components between the Data Centres and the Banks;

“Core NB System Fault” means a fault in the Central NB System which causes the
NBS not to be available in any one or more Branches for the period that fault persists;

“Customer Critical Exception” means a NB Priority Exception in respect of which
Fujitsu Services has received a Disputed Banking Transaction Notice; and

“Non NB Core Hours” means all hours which are not NB Core Hours.

The Service Levels described in this Annex 3 relate to the performance of the NBS
within the NBS Service Boundaries as measured at the points and/or in the manner
described in this Annex 3.

All calculations (including percentages and averages) upon which the SLTs, ARLs or
other targets in this Schedule are based shall be calculated, and Fujitsu Services’
performance assessed, for the relevant Service Level Measurement Period or
Availability Period as a whole. Without prejudice to that calculation and assessment,
Fujitsu Services' performance against the Service Levels in this Annex 3 shall be
reported monthly for service monitoring purposes in the Service Review Book.

The architecture of the NB System shall be capable of supporting Banking Transactions
(in accordance with applicable Service Levels) carried out in each Branch during the
hours that Branch is actually open for business, except during the period from 2000 to
0800 each 24 hour period when Banking Transactions shall not be able to be carried

major Releases in accordance with paragraph 3.5.1 of the CCD entitled “Service
Management: Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0007) (formerly “Service
Management Service: Service Description” (CS/SER/014))), activities in support of
software distribution, continuity tests and Reference Data update and such other
activities as the parties may agree). Such periods shall be scheduled by agreement with
Post Office in accordance with current practices used in respect of the Applications
(other than the NBS) and the Infrastructure Services, such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld.

For the purposes of the NBS, in particular the NBS Service Levels described in this
Annex 3 to Schedule B4.4, the result of the following calculation:

« MCWP minus MAAWP,
(such result being referred to in this paragraph 1.6 as the “NB Additional Time”) shall
not be less than 15 seconds. Once set, or as otherwise specified in the CCD entitled
“NBS Definition” (BP/SPE/035), changes to the MCWP and/or MAAWP where the
resulting MCWP is less than or equal to 40 seconds and where the resulting NB
Additional Time is more than or equal to 15 seconds shall be subject to change under
Operational Business Change (as applicable in respect of product change), and
changes where the resulting MCWP is greater than 40 seconds and/or the resulting NB
Additional Time is less than 15 seconds shall be subject to agreement under the Change
Control Procedure.
This Annex 3 sets out five categories of performance measures:
1.7.1 NB Request and NB Authorisation transmission time measures;
1.7.2 NBS availability measures; and

purposes of this paragraph 2.1 referred to as “T2”) which elapses between the
NB Authorisation Agent generating each NB Request for routing to the Banks
and the corresponding NB Authorisation being received back from the Banks
by the NB Authorisation Agent.

Fujitsu Services shall calculate a value for “T” for each Banking Transaction as
follows:

T=71-T2.

The Service Level Targets are that the average Time for NBS Transactions
conducted in Branches using Fixed ADSL and Dialled Connections taken
together, for the periods such connections are scheduled to be established,
shall not exceed 2.5 seconds.

2.2 NBS availability measures

2:24

Central Systems Availability

(a) Subject to paragraph 2.2.1(b), Fujitsu Services shall record and/or
calculate the following:

(i) the number of Core NB System Faults which causes the
NBS not to be available in 20% or more of all Branches;
and

(ii) in respect of each Core NB System Fault, the average

period of time (“Average Branch Outage”) that the NBS is
not available in a Branch affected by that Core NB System
Fault, as follows:

Average Branch Outage = A multiplied by B,
where:
A= the period, excluding the first five minutes, that a Core

NB System Fault causes the NBS not to be available in
any one or more Branches;

Schedule B4.4 Annex 3 Part: A version 12.0

B = the number of Branches where the NBS is not
available as a result of that Core NB System Fault
expressed as a proportion of the total number of Branches.

(b) For the purposes of the recording and/or calculations referred to in
paragraph 2.2. 1(a) of this Annex 3 which are to be used for the purposes
of paragraph 2.2.1(c) of this Annex 3:

(i) Core NB System Faults that cause the NBS not to be
available for 5 minutes or less; and

(ii) all non-availability of the NBS due to any of the system
management activities referred to in paragraph 1.7 of
this Annex 3 or to any other system changes agreed by
the Parties,

shall be excluded, and
(iii) Branches referred to in paragraph 2.2.1(a) of this
Annex 3 are those Branches where the NBS is required

(subject to Clause 2.2) to be available.

(c) The Service Level Targets in respect of each Availability Period are set
out in the following table:

2.3 Data Reconciliation Service measures
2.3.1 Fujitsu Services shall measure the time taken to resolve each NB Priority

Exception, counting time within MSU Days only, as follows:

(a)

(c)

where no Disputed Banking Transaction Notice has been received by
Fujitsu Services and a Banking Transaction persists in system state
category number 4 or 12 as set out in the CCD entitled “Network Banking
End to End Reconciliation Reporting” (CS/SPE/011), such measurement
shall commence at 0800 on the second MSU Day following receipt by the
DRSH of the corresponding C4 Confirmation or D Message (as
applicable);

where a Disputed Banking Transaction Notice is received by Fujitsu
Services and a corresponding C4 Confirmation or D Message has been
received by the DRSH prior to the day of receipt of that Disputed Banking
Transaction Notice, such measurement shall commence at the time of
receipt of the Disputed Banking Transaction Notice (but not if already
commenced in accordance with (a) above, in which case (a) shall apply);
and

where a Disputed Banking Transaction Notice is received by Fujitsu
Services and a corresponding C4 Confirmation or D Message is received
by the DRSH on the same day as that Disputed Banking Transaction
Notice or on a subsequent day, such measurement shall commence at 0800
on the next MSU Day following receipt of that C4 Confirmation or D Message
(as applicable).

In each case above the NB Priority Exception shall be deemed resolved and
measurement shall stop at the time Fujitsu Services sends information to Post
Office sufficient to enable Post Office to settle that exception with the relevant
Bank, as described in the CCD entitled “Reconciliation Service: Service

Schedule B4.4 Annex 3 Part: A version 12.0

CONFIDENTIAL

POL00027937

POL00027937

Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0015) (formerly “On Line Services
Reconciliation & Incident Management” (NB/PRO/002)).

In respect of each NB Priority Exception where Fujitsu Services requires:
(a) information from, or access to, a Branch; or
(b) information from the Post Office regarding Banks,

for that exception to be resolved, the following shall not count towards the time
for resolution of that exception:

(a) the period, if any, during which Fujitsu Services is unable to contact (by
telephone or other method agreed by the Parties) the Branch in question
or the Post Office regarding Banks in order to request that information or
access, provided that Fujitsu Services has used reasonable endeavours
to make such contact; and

(b) the period, if any, whilst Fujitsu Services waits for that information or
access to be provided by the Branch in question or the Post Office
regarding Banks, having requested it, provided that Fujitsu Services has
repeated such request at reasonably frequent intervals.

The discounting of the periods described in 2.3.2(c) and 2.3.2(d) above shall
be subject to Fujitsu Services providing reports to Post Office setting out the
reasons for discounting any such periods from the resolution time for a NB
Priority Exception and the duration of such periods.

In respect of each Disputed Banking Transaction Notice, Fujitsu Services shall
continue to check on each MSU Day following that notice whether a
corresponding C4 Confirmation or D Message has been received until either a
Customer Critical Exception arises and is resolved or Fujitsu Services and Post
Office agree alternative action.

For the purposes of paragraph 2.3 of this Annex 3:
(a) “day” means a period running for 24 hours from 00:00; and

(b) a C4 Confirmation or D Message received on a day by the DRSH after
21:30 on that day shall be deemed to have been received the next day.

The Service Level Target set out in paragraph 2.3.6 of this Annex 3 shall apply
in respect of:

(a) all Customer Critical Exceptions; and
(b) the first 500 NB Priority Exceptions (other than Customer Critical

Exceptions) occurring on each day (excluding those described in
paragraph 2.3.5(c)),

Schedule B4.4 Annex 3 Part: A version 12.0

Page 33 of 51
CONFIDENTIAL

but shall not apply in respect of:

(c) NB Priority Exceptions (other than Customer Critical Exceptions) arising
from a common cause, in each case where the number of NB Priority
Exceptions arising from such common cause is greater than 100.

2.3.6 The Service Level Target is that the resolution time (measured in accordance
with paragraphs 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 of this Annex 3) for 95 % of the NB Priority
Exceptions specified in paragraph 2.3.5 of this Schedule B4.4 shall not exceed
8 hours.
3. REMEDIES

3.1 Liquidated Damages

3.1.1

The liquidated damages payable by Fujitsu Services shall be based on a series
of measurements, accumulated over a range of Services. This paragraph 3
specifies the contribution made by the NBS.

In respect of each Service Level Measurement Period the liquidated damages
payable by Fujitsu Services for failures to achieve the SLTs set out in
paragraphs 2.1.5 and 2.3.3 of this Annex 3 shall equal:

(a) the sum of Remedies(Time) and Remedies(Reliability) as referred to in
paragraph 3.3 of this Annex 3 and Table 4 of the CCD entitled "Branch
Network: Service Description" (SVM/SDM/SD/0011) respectively for that
period, less

(b) the amount recoverable under paragraph 3.1.7(a) as liquidated damages
for any failures of the ARLs corresponding to those SLTs.

In respect of each Availability Period the liquidated damages payable by
Fujitsu Services under this Annex 3 shall equal the sum _ of
Remedies(Availability1) and Remedies(Availability2) as referred to in
paragraph 3.4 for that period.

In addition to the sums referred to in paragraphs 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 of this Annex
3 Fujitsu Services shall also pay liquidated damages calculated as set out in
paragraph 4 of this Annex 3.

The total cumulative sums payable for liquidated damages by Fujitsu Services
under this Agreement shall not exceed the limits set out in paragraph 2.7 of
Schedule C1.

Liquidated damages shall never be payable by Post Office under this Annex 3
and if the result of a calculation under paragraphs 3.1.2, 3.1.3 or 4 is negative,
Fujitsu Services shall not be obliged to pay liquidated damages in respect of
that Service Level Measurement Period or Availability Period (as the case may
be) and the negative sum shall be disregarded and not set off against

PAYMENT FILE DELIVERY

Fujitsu Services’ obligations regarding transmission of Payment Files (as that term is
defined in the CCD entitled “Mapping Schedule B3.2 to the HNG-X Solution”
(REQ/GEN/REP/1091) (formerly “Debit Card MoP Functional Description”
(EF/SER/001))) to the MA shall be as specified in the CCD entitled “Mapping Schedule
B3.2 to the HNG-X Solution” (REQ/GEN/REP/1091) (formerly “Debit Card MoP
Functional Description” (EF/SER/001)). In the event that an attempt to transmit a
Payment File to the MA in accordance with that CCD fails then those provisions shall
be supplemented by paragraph 5.2.

Where Fujitsu Services attempts to transmit a Payment File to the MA and the attempt
is unsuccessful Fujitsu Services shall be required to make one further attempt to
transmit that file to the MA on that day. If such further attempt fails, Fujitsu Services
shall report the same to the Post Office. Thereafter, Fujitsu Services shall provide such
assistance and co-operation as set out in the Working Document entitled “DC
Operational Level Agreement’ for the purposes of procuring the transmission of that
Payment File to the MA as soon as reasonably practicable.

In the event that the process specified in paragraph 5.2 above has been followed by
Fujitsu Services, no payment of liquidated damages (as specified in paragraph 5.4
below) will be payable by Fujitsu Services due to the relevant Payment File not reaching
the MA.

Subject to paragraph 5.3 above, in the event that a Payment File is not received by the
MA by the time specified for such in the CCD entitled “Horizon — Streamline Application
Interface Specification” (EF/IFS/002) on the day after creation of the Payment File,
liquidated damages will be payable by Fujitsu Services to Post Office, by Fujitsu
Services issuing Post Office with a credit note, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the day on which the MA receives the Payment File. Such liquidated damages
(to be applied by way of credit) will be calculated in accordance with the following
formula:

liquidated damages per Payment File not received as stated above (£) =
{(X x Y/365} x Z

where:

X = the value (pounds sterling) of the relevant Payment File;

Y = the figure (expressed as a percentage) representing the base rate of Barclays Bank
Plc (prevailing on the day the Payment File is required to be delivered (as specified in
the CCD entitled “Horizon - Streamline Application Interface Specification”

(EF/IFS/002)) plus 3 per cent.; and

Z= the number of days from and including the date after creation of the Payment File
until and including the day on which the MA receives the Payment File.

Fujitsu Services shall pay Post Office the sum of £353.47 (representing Post Office's
costs of obtaining the Relevant Data and effecting manual settlement).

In respect of each DC Exception Reimbursement, Fujitsu Services shall pay to Post
Office an amount equal to the sum of the DC Transaction Value and £125.06.

Save where paragraph 6.5 applies (in which event the provisions of this paragraph 6.7
shall not apply), for each DC Exception (other than a DC Exception Reimbursement)
Fujitsu Services shall (provided manual settlement has been effected) pay to Post Office
the lesser of:

Relevant Data in circumstances where Fujitsu Services is in Default of its obligation in
paragraph 6.3 above to obtain such Relevant Data or a payment is required to be made
to Post Office pursuant to paragraph 6.5 above, it shall pay to Post Office liquidated
damages. The liquidated damages shall be calculated in accordance with the following
formula:

liquidated damages (£) = (N x TV x Y) / 365
where:

N = the number of MSU Days, including the day the BIM Report was due for delivery
pursuant to paragraph 6.2 above, that the BIM Report is delivered late;

TV = the DC Transaction Value; and

ANNEX 4 TO SCHEDULE B4.4 - MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES
1. IMPLEMENTATION - SERVICE LEVEL TARGETS: INSTALLATION OF SERVICE

INFRASTRUCTURE

General principles for creating Service Levels for each Implementation shall be agreed
between Post Office and Fujitsu Services on a case by case basis in accordance with
the Change Control Procedure.

2. SERVICE LEVELS AND OTHER TARGETS FOR TESQA
21 Availability
2.1.1 Fujitsu Services shall, upon the expiry of each SLT Calendar Year, measure

the time that TESQA was available to be logged on to by TESQA Users as a
proportion of the total time between 07:00 and 22:00 on each day of that year
("TESQA Availability").

The Service Level Target is that TESQA Availability in each SLT Calendar
Year shall be no less than 99.75% which equals less than or equal to 13 hours
30 minutes Downtime. Fujitsu Services shall notify Post Office of any failures
to achieve this target monthly on an exception basis.

For the purposes of the above SLT, the Service Level Measurement Period is
each SLT Calendar Year.

2.2 Query Time

2.24

Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the query time
for all properly constrained transaction queries (as defined below) between
07:00 and 18:00 is no longer than 20 seconds.

For the purposes of paragraph 2.2.1, a properly constrained transaction query
is one of:

(a) APAN and a date/time range of 31 days or less (rolling).
(b) APAN, an amount and a date/time range of 31 days or less (rolling).

(c) APAN, a Banking Transaction and a date/time range of 31 days or less
(rolling).

(d) APAN, a FAD, a frequency greater than 1 and a date/time range of 31
days or less (rolling).

(e) No PAN, but an amount greater than 4,999.98 and a date range of less
than 1 day.

Schedule B4.4 Annex 4 Version 12.0

Page 42 of 51

POL00027937
POL00027937
CONFIDENTIAL

(f) No PAN, but a frequency greater than 4 and a date range of less than 1
day

If Fujitsu Services persistently fails to achieve the target described in
paragraph 2.2.1 as a result of a lack of capacity or performance of the Horizon
Service Infrastructure, then increases in capacity or performance required to
address the deficiency shall be dealt with by the Capacity Management
Service.

Fujitsu Services shall make available a report of the TESQA query times to the
Service Management Relationship. The report shall show, for different periods
during 07:00 and 22:00 of each day, the query times for each type of query
(including for properly constrained transaction queries, unconstrained
transaction queries, data queries and count only queries).

TESQA will have the ability to decrypt encrypted PANs on an individual basis.
These requests shall be excluded from the measurement of achievement of
the target in paragraph 2.2.1 above.

For properly constrained transaction queries using a PAN as described in
paragraph 2.2.2 above, the target time in paragraph 2.2.1 above shall be
extended. Such extension to the target time shall be agreed between the
Parties and shall not exceed twice the target time in paragraph 2.2.1 above.
The extended target time shall apply from X2 (as described in Part 1 of Annex
1 of Schedule B5) until a date to be agreed between the Parties that shall be
a date after there are no more in clear PAN values within the Transaction
Enquiry Service.

2.3 Data Load

2.3.1

Fujitsu Services shall measure the time taken for data to become available for
interrogation to TESQA, measured from the time that the data is available within
the Data Centre either from an external source, or when an update to the status
of a Transaction is recorded in Transaction data by the Data Centre components
internally ("Data Load Time").

The Service Level Target in respect of the Data Load Time is that:

(a) Subject to paragraph 2.3.2(c), 97% of the data will be available within 15
minutes between 07:00 and 20:00 on each day of each SLT Calendar
Year, except in the event that the Transaction Enquiry Service fails or an
Incident occurs in which case the data will be available within two hours
(for 100% of all queries);

(b) Subject to paragraph 2.3.2(c), 97% of the data will be available within 40
minutes between 20:00 and 22:00 on each day of each SLT Calendar
Year, except in the event that the Transaction Enquiry Service fails or an
Incident occurs in which case the data will be available within two hours
(for 100% of all queries);

(c) 100% of the data will be available within four hours during each SLT
Calendar Year at all other times of the day; and

(d) For the purposes of the SLT described in paragraph 2.3.2, the Service
Level Measurement Period is each SLT Calendar Year.

24 After Hours Availability

2.4.1

3. SERVICE LEVELS FOR POL FS SERVICES

3.1 Availability

3.1.1

Fujitsu Services shall measure the time that Configured POL FS in live
operational use (as opposed to in development or testing environments) is
available to be logged into by POL FS Users as a proportion of the total time
between 07:30 and 19:30 hours on Working Days (“POL FS Availability”).

Subject to paragraph 3.1.3, the Service Level Target for the POL FS System
is that:

(a) POL FS Availability in each Service Level Measurement Period shall be
greater than or equal to 98.5%.

(b) the POL FS System shall not be unavailable to be logged into by POL FS
Users on any single occasion in any Service Level Measurement Period
for more than four hours, or ten hours where offsite engineering expertise
or replacement equipment is required,

measuring time in relation to paragraphs 3.1.2(a) and 3.1.2(b) between 07:30
and 19:30 on Working Days only and excluding time required, following a
failure, to repair or recover Configured POL FS, the SAP Loading Applications
and/or the underlying database.

If the elements of the POL FS System used to support live operational use of
Configured POL FS become unavailable and failover occurs pursuant to
paragraph 5.2 of Schedule B2, the period of such unavailability shall not be

3.2.4

If Fujitsu Services persistently fails to achieve the targets described in
paragraph 3.2.1 as a result of lack of capacity or performance of the POL FS
System, then increases in capacity or performance required to address the
deficiency shall be dealt with by the Capacity Management Service.

3.3 Transaction Performance

3.3.1

For the purposes of this paragraph 3.3, “SAP System Time” means the time
that it takes for the SAP Software elements (excluding network and
communication links) of the POL FS System to complete any given transaction
that a POL FS User may perform using Configured POL FS.

The Parties shall agree from time to time (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld) and record a reasonable sample set of transactions
types that may be undertaken by POL FS Users (“Sample Transaction
Types”) using Configured POL FS and a target maximum SAP System Time
in respect of each such transaction type and each shall be specified, once
agreed, in this Schedule B4.4.

Fujitsu Services shall monitor the Sample Transaction Types to determine the
average SAP System Time for transactions of each Sample Transaction Type
in each Service Level Measurement Period.

Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours within the capacity and
performance constraints of the POL FS System to ensure that the average
SAP System Times for transactions of each Sample Transaction Type as
measured in each Service Level Measurement Period do not exceed the
applicable target maximum SAP System Times specified in this accordance
with paragraph 3.3.2 of this Schedule B4.4.

If Fujitsu Services persistently fails to achieve the targets referred to in
paragraph 3.3.4 as a result of a lack of capacity or performance of the POL FS
System, then increases in capacity or performance required to address the
deficiency shall be dealt with by the Capacity Management Service.
