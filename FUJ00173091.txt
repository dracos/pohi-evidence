je have found an issue in that the Netcool Audit files written by SYSMAN4 have 1 column in a different order to SYSMAN3
Not sure if it will cause the Audit server an issue in retrieving data, but for completeness we have fixed it

jould you raise a peak against which we can make the delivery

outed to Pete to make updated delivery of EAP Writer. Need to discuss with John as to the target as EAP was delivered at R15.15
shich has this issue so do we wait until R16.20 to fix ? I would say no and that a R15.16 hot fix is required which gets applied to
svat, LST and Live otherwise this Audit data will be in the wrong format.

Please can you get Peak PCO260335 routed back to Tivoli-Dev and we'll review the format of the event audit extract to ensure this
00S matches the current format. We should also be able to accommodate Gerald's request to change the first character of the file

Subject: RE: R15 Outstanding Peaks

wi Shaun,

I attach an old and new file.

he differences are more than just one extra column.

he new one has 4 columns less in total even though as the PEAK says there is an extra column at the start!
[fhe audit parsing will go wrong unless the old and the new match exactly in format.

so there is quite a bit of work to do for PC0260335 .

[these files are converted to spreadsheets by audit.

[fhe column headers are in DEV/APP/SPG/0020 section 4.2.3.3.

lonce all this is sorted out and a delivery made would it be possible to change the first character of the file name from E to F so
that audit will know to ignore the previous E series?

ii Mark,

an a PEAK please be raised and targeted at 16.21 and assigned to audit dev saying that the new hopefully F starting files need to
pe processed for BAL events by audit?

Having talked to everyone ... the current agreement is

ec0260335 SV&l R16.20 - Sysman4 = Extra column in data compared to sysman3

ill go into R15.31.50 for LST, expected date into live is mid Aug.

111 also need a top up back to SVal

Julia ... I hope that's OK.

Gerald has looked at the impact ( Below ... thanks)

Iso he will be generating a new peak for ARC to add the extra bits. The current suggestion is that we target that one to R16.21, and
you've guessed it that will need a top up back to Sv&I.

lash and Julia or is it Adam, I hope that's ok.

Hi Geof,

FUJ00173091
FUJ00173091

ff phoned Shaun and 1 think I understand this now:

nly a few SYSMAN4 event files are generated at the moment. Audit stores them but otherwise does not use them. Therefore the format
jdces not matter other than it would be nice for the formats to be consistent.

However at 16.20 the Bals will start generating SYSMAN4 events and audit will need to start using them for prosecution team
spreadsheets. The format must be correct then.

joreover there is a dropped audit ball.

laudit will need to start using the SYSMAN4 events. This will require a change to the RFIEventsASPLink table to add the extra share
to scan.

so I will request a PEAK to make this change.
currently we gather from \\PEDS001\Audit$<file:///\\PEDS001\Audit$> and use those events for prosecution queries.

le also gather from \\PTEM201\Audit$<file:///\\PTEM201\Audit$> but do not currently use these events.

low it says in the audit HDCR spreadsheet for this latter share "No counter events so no prosecution spreadsheet requirement".
liowever Shaun tells me that Bal events will be put there at 16.20 and we do check those.

so at 16.20 the audit software will need to start using these events too I believe.

Regards,

lcerald Barnes

Ir requested R15.16 as a hot top-up like we have done for some other Eventing type changes to ensure these get onto Live ASAP. If we
loo for 15.31 then it could be months before this gets onto live.

the other way is to implement the updated file on all TEMv2 platforms via MSC and then for a formal catch up at R22.??

[the fix is a simple change to a single file so that it exports event data in the correct format.

jow appears that the code is OK but Gerald has requested that the suggested change in the format of the output file name still be
made. This will help to differentiate the correctly formed output files where SEQUENCE NO is the last column in the file.

Will make and release this change now.
