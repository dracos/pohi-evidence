Jeu. anes,

When we spoke in Edinburgh, we agreed to arrange a date to discuss the progress being
made on the commitments the Post Office made following the publication of the Second
Sight Report. Alwen will be in touch with Janet to find a suitable date in the first part of
January.

I should like us to be able to update you both on the improvements we are making to the
way we engage with subpostmasters, take their feedback and support them when things
go wrong; and on the mediation scheme.

On the latter, we received 144 applications by the time the scheme closed on 18
November. The Working Group, chaired by Sir Anthony Hooper, has agreed a process to
allow a proper investigation of applications accepted so that it can make an informed and
evidence based decision on whether a case should proceed to mediation. Under this
process, it may take longer than first envisaged before the first cases reach the
mediation stage which is why I think it would be sensible for us to meet in the New Year
rather than earlier. In the meantime, if there is anything you need to know, please do not
hesitate to let me know.

I look forward to seeing you and hope that in the meantime, you will have a good
Christmas.
