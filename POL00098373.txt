Dear all, just a quick note to say thank you for your help and briefing for the above.
Alwen has a set of notes from the call, so you are very welcome to consult those for a full debrief.

It went as well as we could have hoped. James agreed to most of what we asked him to do. We will need to
wait for him to consult Janet to be sure. But the call will have moved things on and that is good.

The most important outcome to secure is the clarity around the two parts to the Tor.

Alwen, did you catch up with Janet? As you said, it is critical that we keep up the momentum from the
call: narrowing back down SS to the ToR is urgent - je., James’ letter. It might help if she realises
that unless the letter goes soon, Janes won't get his interim meeting in time.

Can you_confirm by return what you see as next steps by who/when for the different parts to this jinc.,
stakeholders, so we can be clear by end of today?

Thanks again,

Paula
