Actions from last meetings

1. There remained some uncertainty about the reporting lines for CEOs of BIS
portfolio businesses. The general view was that Companies House (Tim Moss)
should report into ShEx as an executive agency but Land Registry, UKEF and POL
should have their own reporting lines. Questions remained over OS where the CEO
was at DG level and Met Office. Cabinet Office were likely to have guidance on
reporting structures.

5. Dominic presented a Summary Risk Register drawing on risks from within project
teams. It was accepted that such a pack was too large for ExCo to review on a
regular basis and it was agreed that the idea of setting up a ShEx Risk Committee to
review high level risks and escalate major risks to ExCo should be explored.
Particular areas of focus would be identifying missing risks, reviewing where
mitigation was significantly minimising the risk, identifying the “top 10” risks and
giving assurance that new areas of work had been subject to the correct level of
scrutiny. The RiskCo should also be open to ShEx Board members to attend should
they wish. Hannah Chaplin will continue to be engaged on the Quality Assurance
work.

Action: Dominic to revert to ShEx in June with plans for a RiskCo together with
draft ToR.
