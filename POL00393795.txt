Business Service Management Service Reporting,

1.0 PURPOSE

The purpose of this report is to provide information regarding management of
the live environment and the effects of Horizon on individual business units.
The critical success factors (CSF’s) within the report are intended to highlight
the impacts on areas of key performance as defined by business units.

It is really about where we are ‘feeling, the pain’ - as historical data builds up
we will be able to analyse and report trends more effectively.

This report also contains performance statistics for the Horizon System
Helpdesk (HSH) and Network Business Support Centre (NBSC) to provide
visibility of potential problems. These will be analysed in relation to the CSF’s
to identify potential links, which in turn will feed into the service
improvement process.

The Horizon Service Review Framework provides a basis for improvements
on Service failures to be progressed.

Comments.

- First tranche of staff in post to cope with the increased number of errors from Horizon offices. Internal staff placed on a panel and allocated to individual teams for clearing the
increases up to May 2000.

- Although recent weeks have produced a high number of errors for Horizon and manual offices and the length of the learning curve has increased, the latest forecast of extra staff
numbers are now in line with the original forecast by applying the average error clearance rates achieved in the last 6 months

- More staff wil be required at the end of the roll out timetable for extra on-going work (completing table 12 parcel income figures) on Horizon offices now.

- This is a revised learning curve based on errors produced in the last 15 weeks at Horizon offices. The height of this curve is not as severe during the early stages after
iconversion as that previously used. Errors produced per office in the 1st weeks after conversion, base don th elast offices to go live, are shown in the table below.

- The length of the current learning curve is at least 20 weeks and the level of outlets in the sample gives confidence that this is statistically sound, The tail of the learning
‘curve remains well above the baseline for over 20 weeks after conversion. If this continues, then the effect on TP extends to September 2001.

- From the limited information available for converted offices at the moment, the learning curve is assumed to return to the manual baseline after 30 weeks.

Comments

The main cause of the problem is that many tables on the Cash Account are not mandatory for completion and some postmasters are realising this once the
account has been printed, thus the information has not been captured.

Impact

m Extra resource needed to input data into the system.

® Client Information distorted if not completed.
& Postmasters pay impacted - knock on effect could be more challenges on remuneration to TP

Recent figures show a considerable improvement over earlier months.

PROBLEM MANAGEMENT - Business Service Management

Problem Management enables us to keep up to date with any problems or concerns
regarding the Horizon System. A problem is formed by a regular occurrence of a
similar incident which is then transferred to Problem Management from the Incident
Management team. Not all problems are included in this summary however details
are available on request.

A summary of PONU’s problem database at the end of April is shown in the table
below. This data is retrieved on a monthly basis by a problem manager and then
analysed by a member of the Operations Performance Team.

7.9 - NEGATIVE RM REVALUATION (April 2000)

Kevin Lenihan - (Head of Problem Management)

Background

On Thursday 7 April 2000 (0930 hrs), it was evident from the number and
type of calls received that a problem was beginning to emerge in relation to
the Royal Mail revaluation. It was quickly apparent that this was a major
issue that would have significant impacts and therefore Problem Mgt treated
it as a Potential Major Business Continuity Incident (MBCI). We had
recognised that the problem had potential to flare up the following week but
with greater impact. Remedial action was put in place but the sheer volume
of calls taken on 2/3 May meant that significant delays occurred. (No details
yet of the error costs arising which will have impacted Transaction Processing - they
are currently looking at these figures).

Root cause of the Problem

Not yet established ,nor agreed with ICL Pathway - meeting planned for 14
June to discuss this and other associated issues. One of the key disputes
surrounds ICLP’s attitude to this. Admittedly if no one had made mistakes
then no problems would have occurred. However if a wrong figure is
entered, the system was designed to let you reverse that - the issue is that in
many cases that was not possible. This issue is still a major factor we have yet
to resolve as part of the Problem resolution.

Next Steps
All BSM reports in respect of this problem were forwarded to ICLP to address
/ formulate actions as appropriate. There are numerous issues to resolve -
meeting with ICLP, arranged for 14 June (Head of BSM Operations to lead).
Details of all action arising will be documented in full and circulated to HERF
members FYI.

8.0 Non conformance

(Des Harsbury Problem Managenen Team)

Girobank Postmaster’s Daily Record ( PDRs )

ISSUE: Girobank have agreed a phased program to accept printed versions of
the daily report forms for Deposits (G4631 ) and Withdrawals (G4632) from
all Horizon offices. However, the continued acceptance of these forms is
dependent on the level of errors received at Girobank being reduced. The
errors largely relate to factors that prevent the forms being read by Optical
Character Recognition equipment.

SCALE: Girobank are providing weekly reports that list all the offices that
present PDRs containing print and presentation errors. However, because of
the cost to Girobank of providing full details, the reports only show the
number of forms with errors against the number of forms presented, not the
specific errors.

The table below shows print & presentation errors reported for the current
year.

Week Error Offices % Error
PDRs
ol 299 2697 63655 0.74
02 214 2919 60028 0.52
03 195 3215 65209 043,
04 201 3463, 46555 0.55
05 178 3707 54325, 0.47
06 292 4100 91838 0.48:
07 487 4619 88906 0.74

After an initial fall the error level stabilised until wk. 07 when the increase in
the number of offices presenting PDRs containing errors was far greater than
could be accounted for by the increase in the number of offices authorised to
use the forms. This corresponded with the start of the program to roll out the
forms to the offices which had previously been migrated but not allowed by
Girobank to use the forms. However, only two of the backlog offices were
listed on the report for wk.07. An alternative theory was that the increase in
errors may have been linked to the problems associated with the revaluation
exercise, but once again the offices affected by the revaluation problems were
underrepresented on the report for wk. 07. Further investigation is therefore
required.

WAY FORWARD: All authorised offices have been provided with information on the
errors being monitored and the correct procedures to follow.

Since wk. 05 the reports have been analysed to highlight the worst offices - in terms of
percentage error rate and / or number of times reported. The offices highlighted are sent a
copy of the original communication together with a letter which points out their poor
performance and explains why it is necessary to eliminate errors. This method has been
adopted because we are unable to specify the errors being made.

The key messages will be reiterated in a forthcoming, Counter News article

9.0 Non-polled offices
(Mick Theobald - Problem Management)

This issue has recently received high profile awareness; the following is a statement which
outlines the nature and scope of the problem and additionally the actions taken by
Business Service Management to resolve the situation.

ICL Pathway have a contracted Service Level Agreement to deliver all Automated
Payment transactions to Post Office Network by Day D (i.e. no office should remain
unpolled for a period of time in excess of 3 days)..

Owing to the inability of certain ICL Pathway investigative and diagnostic processes to
react quickly enough to initial non-polling, incidents, in a number of cases the length of
time a specific office remains unpolled has significantly exceeded the contracted SLA. In
some instances, this has reached the level whereby payments are not transmitted to clients
who then issue the customer with a reminder or, as in some cases, instigate disconnection
procedures.

On 3«! May, there were 100 offices which had not been polled for more than 3 days (as
reported by ICL Pathway) and therefore fell outside the contracted SLA for AP

transactions. The worst of these had not been polled for 26 days.

ICL Pathway set up a daily “war room’ to look at incidents with a view to identifying root
causes and resolving the problem.

Root causes so far identified so far are:

BT faults. The largest percentage of polling failures are caused by problems in the BT
ISDN network . Pathway are working with Energis in this area.

Problems cleared by gateway swaps and/or reboots. Analysis is being performed on
fault reports for gateway PCs which have been swapped out as a result of non-polling,
incidents. Similar work is being, carried out to ascertain why reboots can resolve polling,
failures.

The overall incident management process was reviewed and tightened to ensure that
incidents are handled quicker and calls should not be 'bounced! around various support
units.

Pathway’s root cause analysis and Action Plan for the management of future incidents are
being discussed with PON at a meeting on 14** June with the purpose of agreeing, a
definitive process.

As at 09/06/00, there are 9 offices which represent SLA failure on Pathway’s part (ie.
unpolled for more than 3 days). The worst of these (FAD 055 900) was last polled on
27/05/00 (12 days). This particular office failure relates to a BT exchange issue. Pathway
havew raised this as a problem with BT as BT had previously visited the site without
discovering the problem.

Traffic Light System

Each CSF has at least one measure attached to it. These are shown in blocks and
each block of measures are weighted at 100%. If all are equally important in the
block the 100% is divided across the block of measures. This system works well in
areas like OSG where there are distinct differences in the importance of each
measure. The traffic lights are then used to show the total of the weighting. For
example if a CSF has a number of low graded measures on red but the higher ones
are all on green this suggests that there are no major issues affecting the CSF and
therefore the overall traffic light for that CSF would be green. However in
Transaction Processing all the CSF’s are equally important which means that if any
of the measures are adversely affected the impact is high on TP.
