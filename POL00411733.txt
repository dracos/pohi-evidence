Angela,

Please see attached, as discussed.

The Powerpoint presentation is the input from Linklaters. The Word doc is an internal briefing paper from Mr Foat.

I would propose that the principal work required — the clarification and documentation of working arrangements and
accountability — ought to be performed in a manner consistent with wider work on POL’s target operating model (aka
‘blueprint’ ).

Regards,

Ben

Thanks Jane. You can leave it with us.

Presentation — 13 July
I’ve already reached out to Martyn Hopper at Links for his availability. You may recall that he provided the POL Board

presentation last year and has provided training to key stakeholders and subject matter experts primarily within
POMS (but also POL) on SMR. Ill follow him up today.

Attached is my high level briefing paper to the business and Martyn’s comprehensive presentation.

Thanks Ben

All
I’m on holidays for the next 2 weeks, and I note the session is for 13 July, so we need to move on this:

Ben F — do we have Links on standby for this session (1.35-2.35 on 13/7)?

POL00411733

Sean L/Ben F - can you please look at the scope of what would be relevant bearing in mind the discussion that Links led
last year? It would be helpful if Ben G/Martin E could be tied in to that discussion from the perspective of the work that
is being done on POL accountabilities/TOM/’blueprints’. Can I please leave this with you to progress over the next 2
weeks? If you want to run ideas past me, I will be contactable and will be checking emails.

Many thanks,

Jane

Jane,
Apologies for my tardy response on this.

I'm confident that my proposed approach to developing target state business and operating models (‘blueprints') would
also support the principles of SMR.

The challenge would be to additionally model the current state (for the relevant entities and relationships) and keep this
up-to-date.

As it stands, we don't have a substantive team to do this.
Kind regards,

Ben

GE has asked for some ‘training’ to be provided to it on the Senior Manager’s Regime and the GE actions log shows this
as happening at the next GE meeting on 13 July. Sean has suggested that we ask Linklaters (or equivalent) to lead on
this.

e it would be great if we were also able to link the regulatory framework with the work being done in POL on
accountabilities more generally and which Ben G is working on.

So:

Alwen - please confirm what time is scheduled for this (Sean thought it was an hour?)

Ben F —I seem to recall that Links did do some training on this a while ago (?), and if that is the case then we need to
consider how we reference that and refresh it. In any event, please flag to Links and ask them to hold the time free.
Ben G — is this timetable workable from your perspective and what support do you need to further this work? We
should also think how this might link in to the TOM discussion that we had with Deloitte last week.

Kevin — could you set up a meeting/call for next week for the two Ben, Sean and myself (others optional) to consider
how we could best structure such a session.

Finally — please shout loudly if this doesn’t/can’t/won’t work!!!
Many thanks,

Jane
