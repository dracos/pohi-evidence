Mark:

Prompted by your email on SoS and options for private capital in POL, I asked Richard for an update this afternoon on
BNR and more generally on POL issues. I expect that he has told you already but just in case:

At the board this week, it was made known that the company will likely have to restate net income for provision of
payments to subpostmasters it had not recognised. The amount is likely to be significant. The second issue was that the
migration to a new IT system is not going well and management may not have kept the board as fully apprised as they
might have expected.

I haven't seen a copy of the board papers and have only briefly spoken with Richard. We will catch up in more detail
early next week on these topics and on the SoS request for options on private capital.

Separately, we now have a date of Dec 9 to meet with BNR.

In any case there are a number of issues which arise from all this which we should discuss and I will put some time in the
diary next week.

Cc'ing Richard

Have a great weekend,
Justin

I just got the invite from BNR’s office for Mark and me on Dec 9. You and I are catching up on Tuesday on this. It’d be
good to go through all the significant issues and communications at that catch-up session. May be invite Laura too?

Meantime, anything more broadly on POL beyond BNR I should be aware of?

No, BNR seems to be in a better place. Some peripheral sparrow stuff has cropped up as you will have seen but
nothing to speak of.

Ok. I was cc’d by Laura on some Horizon/BNR stuff earlier in the week. Anything else on BNR - or more broadly - which
I haven't seen?

Do you we have a date for a meeting with BNR?

We have discussed the PO piece of this. It seems to me that you - and the team - have had some very tough duty
caught between PO's problems (real or not) and what a Minister can say. And the advice - what I have seen- has been
very well nuanced to the situation. If its on appointments, the process is the process. Sometimes convenient and

sometimes less so. But hard to argue that you haven't managed it effectively given the (proper) constraints.

Lets see what the issue is and take from there.

Marvellous. Yes, I can give you a full briefing. The problem is we cannot deliver what she wants (a green-locked GIB,
and a Post Office without a perceived but non existent IT problem). Bit harsh from my perspective, we've kept a lid on
the latter and are in a much better position on the former than we should actually be!

Perhaps Claire can find a slot in the diary for me?

Some negative feedback from BNR on ShEx, I’m afraid, in connection with GIB and PO. Came
through Martin.

Generally she thinks we are too technocratic and not sensitive enough on politics. On GIB, the
politics of handling the legislation, on PO similar concerns about poor political handling.

I don’t know if there is anything in this, but clearly she has a problem so we need to jump on it.

I am going to fix a catch-up with her and would ideally like the two of you to come. Richard — you
will probably have the strongest view (!) and we certainly need to get well briefed by you.

Mark
