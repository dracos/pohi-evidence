3.2 Derivation and Use of Data

The messages listed in section 3.1 are generally exchanged as a result of a transaction initiated either by a
clerk at a Post Office outlet or by CAPO. The NBX acts as a message router, filtering messages based on
business rules and transforming received messages into the appropriate format for forwarding to the next
system in the message sequence.

The following table shows the derivation and use of each message exchanged between the NBX and CAPO in
terms of the received message that causes each NBX - CAPO message to be exchanged, and the transmitted
message resulting from the NBX - CAPO message exchange:

Message Sequence
Horizon Horizon NBX CAPO
Outlet Campus
[R1]> [R2] > 0100/0200

< [A3] < [A2] <
0110/0210
[At]
[Co] > Expedi 0420/0421
ted [E1]>
[C2] >
< 0430
{E2]

The messages exchanged over this interface relating to reconciliation and settlement are initiated by the NBX.

Security key exchange messages are initiated by the NBX and acknowledged by CAPO. The NBX will send a
new working key, for each of its Pls, to CAPO at least once in every 24-hour period. The business processes
with respect to these messages are addressed in section 6.4. The following table shows a high-level
description of the security messages exchanged between CAPO and the NBX. The full list of 0800 messages
initiated by the NBX, and acknowledged by a 0810 response from CAPO, can be found in section 4.2.10.

4 Data Items

4.1 Data Item List

4.1.1 General Message Element Definitions and Abbreviations

The following section summarises the list of CAPO Message Elements for each group of transactions, together
with which message(s) they are present in. Each message is classified and identified using the RAC (Request /
Authorise / Confirm) model. Each message element references the corresponding ISO 8583 bitmap position.

The ISO 8583 bit map reference has been included for ease of reference.

The abbreviations used to describe the format and attribute of each data element (DE) and Data Sub-elements
are shown in the following table (taken from ISO 8583 (1987), [Ref. 1]):

LLL to indicate the actual length of the field will prefix all variable length fields.
Ih hexadecimal representation of the data
iz track 2 data as defined by ISO 7811 and ISO 7813
x. Sign — C (credit) or D (debit)
The Field Size column gives the number of characters (octets) required for the data item, as shown in the table
below.
Abbreviation I Description
3 Fixed Length field. Numeric fixed length fields are right justified and zero
padded. Fixed length string fields are left justified and space padded.
10 Variable length field (up to a maximum of 10 characters in this example).

Notes:
e Fixed length numeric fields are unpacked, right justified and zero filled.
e Fixed length alphanumeric fields are left justified and space filled.
The “Required” column indicates whether the field is Mandatory or Conditional for the messages defined in this

AIS. For conditional fields, the field description should indicate under what circumstances the data for the field
should be populated or omitted from the message.

The “Description” column contains a brief description of the field, as used in the messages defined in this AIS,
together with any additional comments.

CAPO will operate in Mixed case, and will not validate the Alphabetic characters for case in any field.
However, where data is echoed or copied in messages, the echoed/copied fields should be in the same case
as the original field.

The POCA Servers and the NBX Servers both use the ASCII English character set (CCSID = 437).

4.2 Data Interpretations

This section contains the definition of each message type to be sent over this interface. The Message Element
column lists those elements required for the message, and relate to the list in Section 4.1.2.

The Required column in the message definition tables within this section contain the following codes:

Code Meaning

M The element is mandatory and must be present in this message

Cc The element is conditional for this message, and the condition to be applied is
stated in the Conditions column. If the condition is true, the element must be
present in the message; otherwise the element must not be present in the
message. It should be noted that the receiving system may not be able to
assess whether the condition has been met, in which case it must be able to
interpret the presence or non-presence of the element according to appropriate
business rules.

The Conditions column lists the conditions for inclusion of a conditional message element; inclusion of the
element may depend on details of the transaction type, or simply whether the data is available to the sending
system.

Where Message Elements exist in the IS08583 standard (1987 Version), [Ref. 1] as either Mandatory or
Conditional, but are not required for the CAPO interface, they have been included in the message definition
tables, but have been shaded out and labelled as “Not required”.

Itis essential that developers of this interface also refer to ISO 8583 (1987), [Ref. 1] and the Horizon — Card
Account Mapping, [Ref. 3] for further details of data derivation and use. The message definitions do not
explicitly show the bitmaps as individual message elements, because they are an essential part of the ISO.
8583 (1987) transfer structure. However, all messages passed over this interface will include bitmap 1.
Bitmaps will be formatted as binary.

The [E1] message maps to the following ISO messages:
e 0420 - Reversal Request
e 0421 - Reversal Repeat.

Reversal [E1] messages are generated by the NBX. These are only sent to the FI to reverse a previously
authorised Accept transaction (i.e. [A1]) according to the following conditions:

e The Authorisation [A1] is late (i.e. is received after the Agent timeout period has been exceeded)

e The transaction outcome at the counter is different to the Authorisation response received at the
counter ([A3]) (e.g. clerk declines to proceed due to suspected fraud)

e The transaction outcome at the counter is indeterminate (e.g. counter has timed out waiting for
response, or ICC failed to complete any script processing)

Reversals [E1] can only be generated when the [A1] message to be reversed can be matched against a
[R3] request.

The NBX prevents duplicate 0420 messages being sent to the FI.

Reversal Requests may be sent up to a period, which shall be configurable and shall be set initially to
5 days, after the original transaction to which it refers.

Note that partial reversals are not supported over this interface. PIN Change reversals are also not
supported.

4.2.8 [E2] - Reversal Request Response

4.2.8.1 Overview
This message is sent by CAPO to the NBX in response to a reversal request from the NBX.

Reversal [E1] messages are “must deliver” messages. If an [E2] Reversal Response from the FI is not

received within a configurable period, a [E1] Reversal Repeat is sent subject to not exceeding a
configurable number of retries / elapsed time.

The [E2] message maps to the ISO message 0430 — Reversal Request Response.

The following figure shows the end-to-end message sequences, using the RACE (Request / Authorise /
Confirm / Exception) model, for all application messages between the NBX and CAPO.

Figure 1 - CAPO Message Flows in the Network Banking Environment

A 0620 message may be issued by the NBX in response to all messages from CAPO (for simplicity, only one
such flow is shown on the diagram). Note also that CAPO will not send 0620 messages to NBX; however, the
diagram shows that NBX will correctly process any that it receives.

Reversals (0420 messages) are not sent from NBX to CAPO unless and until an approved response (0210
message) has been received from CAPO.

In the event that NBX does not receive a reversal response within the allotted time interval then the NBX may
send EBT repeat reversals (0421 messages). CAPO will ensure that a reversal is not applied to an account
more than once.

The interface should be resilient to the transfer of duplicate messages; in practice, however, this should only
happen after failure and recovery of either end of the interface.

CAPO will not validate transmission date and time in messages against the date and time that messages are
received.

The interface details are also described in the NBX — POCA Technical Interface Specification, [Ref. 5].

5.2 Transfer Structure

The messages defined in this AIS will be exchanged in accordance with ISO 8583 (1987), [Ref. 1], which
describes the use of Message Type Identifier, Bit Map and Data Elements in the message structure. Note that
the messages exchanged over this interface do not use the third bit map or any of its supported data elements.
Note also that the Bit Maps are transferred in binary.

Messages for one transaction may be interleaved with messages for any other transaction. Requests (0100
and 0200 messages) may continue to be sent during a key change, using the existing key until the Key
Change response has been received.

5.3 Record Structure

The record structure for the REC file passed over this interface is described in the NBX — Fl Reconciliation and
Settlement File Format AIS, [Ref. 4]. The details are not repeated here.

5.4 Sequences

Figure 1 above (see Section 5.1) shows the end-to-end message sequences of all the messages supported by
this AIS, from the PO Outlet to CAPO. Further detail relating specifically to the NBX-CAPO connection can be
found in the NBX - POCA Technical Interface Specification (Ref. [5]). The interface must be resilient to the
disconnection or loss of any part of the total network-banking environment for short or extended periods.

5.5 Data Volumes

Data Rates and Volumes over this interface are addressed within NBX Volume Model Comparisons, [Ref. 2].

5.6 Data Authentication

Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are not sent between CAPO and the NBX.

6 Security of Transmitted Data

The security standards for the NBX — CAPO interface are described in the NBX — POCA Technical Interface
Specification, [Ref. 5].

6.1 Protected Data

PIN blocks that pass across the interface from NBX to CAPO are encrypted under an Acquirer Working Key
(AWK). This key is used in the NBX - CAPO shared security zone. PIN Blocks encryption is translated from the
other security zone keys to protection under this shared key using a hardware encryption module. The PIN
blocks are never rendered in clear outside the hardware module.

Acquirer Working Keys (AWKs) are exchanged electronically encrypted under an Acquirer Zone Master Key
(AZMK) shared between NBX and CAPO. To facilitate import of the AWK into the CAPO systems, the AWK is
encrypted using Atalla variant 1 as defined in [ATCRM]. The AZMK is generated and owned by CAPO. The
AWK is owned and generated by the NBX.

6.2 Encryption and Decryption Methods

PIN Block and Acquirer Working Key transmission is protected by Triple DES double length keys, 112bit plus
key check data.

All data transmitted on communication lines between the NBX and CAPO as described in the NBX - POCA
Technical Interface Specification, [Ref. 5].

6.3 Session Establishment

Session Establishment will be initiated by the NBX. Initial Logon message exchanges are followed by
transmission of a new AWK by the NBX to CAPO, with a key check value protected by encryption under the
shared current AZMK.

CAPO verifies the key and acknowledges it to NBX. All PIN Block data is protected by this AWK until the
session ends or the AWK is renewed.

The only messages categorised as “must deliver” are Reversal Request (0420/0421).

6.4 Key Management

Key ownership is described in section 10 of the document Horizon — EDS Operational Level Agreement, [Ref.
6]. See also section 6.7 of the document NBX - POCA TIS, [Ref. 5]. NBX - CAPO Zone Management Keys are
managed in NBX.

e« Acomponent number (visible)
* 32 hex characters in two groups of sixteen characters — Triple DES key component, VISA method

Manager.

NBX:
e Manages secure logon of key holders & the key manager
e Accepts entry of key components & verifies component check digits

e Generates the AZMK from the key components & verifies the key check digits
Keys component documents must be stored and transported separately and securely.

The CAPO — NBX AZMK is renewed every six months by the process described above. The AZMK, having
been produced as described above, is securely transported to the NBX. The NBX and CAPO operations will
agree a time for key promotion. Promotion by both parties will be preceded by telephone coordination. After
promotion of the new AZMK the NBX operator will initiate an AWK exchange under the new AZMK using the
AWK Key Change sequence. This will provide online key verification of the AZMK. If this online key verification
procedure is successful the promoted AZMK will be confirmed as the current AZMK. If the AWK exchange is
unsuccessful manual procedures initiated by NBX and CAPO operators will revert to the old AZMK.

CAPO requires more than one Processor Interface (PI) to support the transaction throughput for the NBX. For
this configuration each PI will be configured to support two TCP/IP socket connections. A logical session will
be initiated by a logon, and data for that session will flow over both socket connections belonging to that PI
(see the NBX - POCA Technical Interface Specification, [Ref. 5] for further details). Each Pl generates a NBX
— CAPO Acquirer Working Key (AWK) which it sends to CAPO for validation. This AWK, if validated by CAPO,
is used by both socket connections between CAPO and the NBX PI that generated it. Logical sessions for a
different PI will use the AWK generated by that PI. All NBX Pls will protect their AWK in transit to CAPO by
encryption using the same AZMK, during its six months of currency. The AWKs are changed under the
following conditions (note that it is not necessary to change the AWKs as soon as the AZMK is changed).

e Every 24 hours where the session remains active (an AWK may be changed at a set (configurable) clock
time and will remain valid until it is changed)

«  Atsession initiation by NBX
e  Onreceipt by CAPO of a 6" consecutive invalid PIN block on a session

e When an NBX operator requests a key change.

Work Load Distribution between the Pls will be performed by the NBX at the application level. To ensure that
the correct AWK is used, PIN block translation must occur after PI selection.

The Acquirer Zone Master Key is verified electronically after it has been transferred manually in component
form. The Acquirer Working Keys are exchanged and verified electronically. The network management
(0800/0810) messages used to perform these functions are described in detail in the following sections:

7 Operational Procedures

7.1 Processing Cycles

This interface relates to online and batch message exchange to support real time financial transactions, and to
the daily transmission to CAPO of the REC file.

Stale messages are logged and discarded before transmission or on receipt, as appropriate and no further
processing takes place.

The timeout associated with each message type is addressed in NBX Business Parameters, [Ref. 7].

“Must deliver” messages are retransmitted at parameter intervals until delivery is successful, as described in
NBX Business Parameters, [Ref. 7].

Transfer Initiation

All transfers defined in this AIS are automatic.

7.2 Security Procedures

Manual Procedures are required to support the above key management protocol, as described in Section 6
above.

7.3 Fallback Procedures

Fallback procedures are described in the NBX — POCA Technical Interface Specification, [Ref. 5]. Each
system is responsible for its own recovery after failure. Restoration of the interface and the disposal of stale
messages (other than “must deliver” messages) is expected to be automatic. 0100, 0200, 0110 and 0210 ([R]
and [A]), 0620, 0800 and 0810 messages awaiting transmission at the time of failure can safely be discarded,
as the integrity of the transaction is protected by timeouts. However, 0420 and 0421 ([E]) messages are to be
treated as “must deliver” and therefore must be transmitted on recovery.

7.4 Control

The interface must be resilient to duplicate messages, which may occur after recovery of any element in the
system, but are not otherwise expected to occur.

Lost or discarded messages are handled by timeout processing at every stage of the message sequence, to
ensure that incomplete transactions are declined if unauthorised or reversed if authorised.

The NBX will log events affecting this interface (e.g. response indicating receipt by CAPO of an invalid PIN
block) to an Event Log. These events will be managed by Tivoli for escalation to the relevant Help Desk, as
appropriate to the code associated with the event.

PDS Tag 2 or 4 byte ‘tag’ value (ASCII hexadecimal), identifying the EMV data object contained in the
PDS. The second two bytes are present only if the first byte is odd ('1’, ‘3',.....'B', ‘D’, 'F')
and the second byte is 'F'.

PDS Length 2 bytes, specifying the length (in bytes) of the PDS Data immediately following it, expressed
as an ASCII representation of a decimal number (e.g. ‘12’ means the integer 12) in the
range 1 to 99.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

PDS Data Variable between 1 and 99 bytes, containing the actual data from the corresponding EMV

data object (as identified by the PDS Tag).
The PDS structure is referred to as Tag-Length-Value (TLV), as defined in the EMV standards.

Note that PDS's may appear in any order in Data Zone. The order shown in the table below corresponds to that
in which the relevant fields are input to the ARQC verification algorithm.

PDS's for Card Account
The PDS's required for Card Account transactions (passed in the NBX-EBT On-line Interface) are listed in the

following table. Note that the lengths shown in the table assume that all PDS Data is ASCII representation of
either hexadecimal digits, or decimal digits.
