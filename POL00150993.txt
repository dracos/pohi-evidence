Subject: Fw: Fwd: Urgent: Accessing Horizon

Kev

The request from Lesley and Paula below is urgent and relates to Horizon/second sight, so can you take the lead on this
but draw on Steve, plus FJ eg Pete T.

Note that Paula wants facts, but also Lesley's guidance around relating this to the testing of change because testing the
“system” isn't a quantifiable thing.

Something by the end of today would be great.

Many thanks

Julie/Dave

Ineed some help with both of these.

Julie: the first is for you. This really is in the back of the Deloitte review.

Dave: the second for you. I think this should be phrased around the testing we do around change.
This is fairly urgent as Paula is preparing for the select committee next week.

We can catch up today.

Subject: Urgent: Accessing Horizon

Dear both, your help please in answers and in phrasing those answers, in prep for the SC:

1) "is it possible to access the system remotely? We are told it is."

What is the true answer? I hope it is that we know this is not possible and that we are able to
explain why that is. I need to say no it is not possible and that we are sure of this because of xxx
and that we know this because we have had the system assured.

2) "you have said this is such a vital system to the Post Office, what testing do you do and how
often? When was the last time?

Lesley, I need the facts on these - I know we have discussed before but I haven't got the answer
front of mind - too many facts to hold in my head! But this is an important one and I want to be
sure I do have it. And then Mark, to phrase the facts into answers, plus a line to take the
conversation back up a level - ie., to one of our narrative boxes/rocks.

Thanks, Paula
