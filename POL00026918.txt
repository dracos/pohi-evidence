Introduction

This third Joint Statement sets out further areas of agreement between the Experts. The structure of the document captures expert agreements and
disagreements on Horizon Issues 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.

Issues 10, 11, 12 and 13 are omitted from this report and will be dealt with in a fourth Joint Statement as additional Defendant Witness Statements of Mr
Godeseth and Mr Parker were only received after business hours 28" February 2019 and the experts need more time to consider the subsequent evidence in
relation to those Issues.

We understand that the court wishes to see more emphasis on agreements between the experts in these joint statements. The experts have worked hard to find
agreements where possible, and there are some important areas of agreement which are stated in this statement and in the previous joint statement. However,
there are also deep disagreements between the experts.

Jason Coyne — In this Joint Statement I have sought to document my agreement or disagreement in respect of the 15 Horizon Issues where I can or cannot

reach agreement with Dr Worden. It is my understanding that this is not a responsive report to Dr Worden’s supplemental report, therefore I have not added.
any further comments, criticisms or observations in respect of any responsive report in this Joint Statement.

Expert Agreements and Disagreements by Horizon Issue

Horizon Issue 3 — To what extent and in what respects is the Horizon System “robust” and extremely unlikely to be the cause of shortfalls in
branches?

3.1 Improving Agreed Irrespective of how you define the detail of robustness, in line with
Robustness most other large-scale computer systems, Horizon’s robustness has
generally improved.

From our experience of other computer systems, Horizon is relatively
robust. We agree that ‘robust’ does not mean infallible and therefore
Horizon has and will continue to suffer faults. Robustness limits the
impact of those faults and other adverse events.

Statement

“I Coyne Refs.

Worden

This increase in robustness has, in part, developed from Post Office
discovering bugs/errors and defects in live use and then applying fixes
and improving monitoring.

3.2

Agreed

Computer systems are considered more robust if access to the back-
end databases is restricted tightly.

3.3

‘Agreed

It was possible for some of the Horizon support staff working at
Fujitsu to modify the Horizon back-end branch database.

In 2012, Post Office’s auditors observed that there were inappropriate
system privileges assigned to the APPSUP role (which allowed
amendments to the BRDB).

3.4

RW

Fujitsu took steps to correct the inappropriate system privileges.

Post Office does not consult the full audit data (unfiltered ARQ Data)
before deciding how to handle discrepancies and issuing Transaction
Corrections.

Horizon Changes

Agreed

During the life of Horizon there have been 19,842 changes made to it
via the Fujitsu/Post Office release mechanism.

Horizon Changes

Agreed

It is common modern IT development practice to make frequent
incremental builds and releases of software.

3.10

Changes

Agreed

Specific release note detail has not been provided. Of the 19,842
changes, we would expect that many were minor changes. It is likely
that others contained changes to improve the system or to fix bugs and
defects.

Countermeasures

The effectiveness of various countermeasures changed throughout the
life of Horizon.

3.12

Agreed

Countermeasures are basic elements of practical IT system design

3.13

Countermeasures

Agreed

Countermeasures work by limiting the impact of Horizon bugs/error
and defects on branch accounts.

Countermeasures do not always eliminate the effects of adverse events
(they are not perfect) but they are often effective in the area where
they are deployed; that is why they have become basic elements of
practical IT systems design.

3.14

Countermeasures

RW

Countermeasures work.

Thave assessed more than the design aspirations of the
countermeasures. I have assessed how the countermeasures were
tested; and I have illustrated in a large number of examples, mainly
through KELs and Peaks, how they worked in practice.

Extent

Agreed

It is difficult to measure the extent of the robustness of Horizon, apart
from how it might limit the extent of impact on branch accounts, as in
Issue 1.

$5.5, $5.16

Improving
Robustness

Agreed

There are indications that in its first year of operation, and in the first
year after the introduction of Horizon Online, the system suffered
from more problems than in other years. One might expect a higher
level of problems in these early periods.

The extent to which these problems were serious, or evaded
countermeasures, or caused discrepancies in branch accounts, is not
agreed.

RW

The main way in which the experts have assessed the extent of
robustness of Horizon is to ask to what extent failures of its robustness
impacted branch accounts. I have addressed this in Horizon issue 1. In
answering this question, fluctuations over the years are of less
importance than the sum over all years, if the sum over all years is

small. I have found the sum of impacts on branch accounts over all
rears to be very small.

Agreed

The users of any IT system play a role in assuring its robustness. The
designers of a system should not make unrealistic assumptions about
the users of the system. Unrealistic assumptions would lead to
inappropriate design, making the system less usable.

3.20

Countermeasures

Agreed

As Horizon has changed throughout its lifetime, the existence and
effectiveness of any countermeasures has too. To have considered the
time dependence of all robustness countermeasures over 20 years,
would have made the expert reports impossibly lengthy. There was not
the time to do so.

$5.71

3.21

Countermeasures

RW

‘Recoverable’ transactions do not arise from system faults in Horizon.
Mr Coyne has conflated financial transactions (which may be
recoverable transactions) with database transactions.

$5.105 - 107

3.22

Countermeasures

‘Agreed

Many software bugs can have the same effects as a user error (as
illustrated, for instance, by the Dalmellington bug, which produced a
remming error).

3.23

Countermeasures

RW

I base my opinion that Horizon is a tightly-run ship on the high quality
of documentation, design, review, and testing evident in many
documents I have read; on the Ernst & Young Service audits of
Fujitsu, which found a high level of controls to be effectively
implemented; on Fujitsu’s CMMI accreditation; and on the high
quality and effectiveness of problem analysis and problem solving
shown in KELs and Peaks.

risk assessment. For many projects, there are large risks associated

with existing software which must be integrated with the new solution;

these risks must be assessed retrospectively. Even without existing
software risks, estimation of risks often depends on historic data.
Common simple mathematics are employed retrospectively and
prospectively.

3.25

Likelihood of
shortfalls

Horizon bugs, errors, and defects, along with mistakes made by
Fujitsu/Post Office employees and branch user errors were all likely
causes of shortfalls. Therefore, it would be incorrect to say that
Horizon was extremely unlikely to be the cause of shortfalls.

4.2

Agreed

There is evidence within the Peaks and KELs of bugs/errors/defects
within Horizon arising from parts (a), (b) and (c) of this issue that
occurred without causing financial discrepancies as well as some that
occurred causing financial discrepancies.

Reference Data

Agreed

Reference data is critical to the operation of Horizon and errors in
reference data have led to discrepancies in branch accounts.

Reference Data

Agreed

Of the bugs which in the experts’ opinion had the potential to produce
discrepancies in branch accounts there may be some involvement of
reference data in Bureau Discrepancies, Bureau de Change, Wrong
branch customer change displayed, Lyca top-up, and Drop and Go.
(rows 14, 23, 24, 25, and 28 of the bugs table in the second expert joint
statement)

It is notable that these bugs all concerned specific products (arising
from the reference data defining those products).

So, while reference data bugs may be a significant proportion of the
bugs with financial impact, Once discovered, they could be quickly
fixed (by a change to the reference data) once the bug is correctly
identified.

45

JC

The full extent of potential for errors in data recorded within horizon
arising from a), b) and c) above has been difficult to measure since not
all errors are known. However, Peaks and KELs illustrate (by their
existence) that errors in data recorded did occur, some with financial
impact, some not.

Post Office back office accounting processes were relevant to branch
account accuracy. i.e., Product and Branch Accounting processes and
actions in respect of discrepancy investigations and issuing of Cash in
Pouches, TCs, Foreign Currency etc.

5.3

Reconciliation

Agreed

The adequacy of Post Office back office processes to prevent
discrepancies in branch accounts can be measured by the quality of the
TC process. This quality includes:

© The processes of consideration of available data

© The level of errors observed in the process

¢ The level of complaints or disputes raised following a TC

¢ The level of upheld complaints following a TC

e The level of financial impact of erroneous TCs

Third Party Data

Agreed

Errors in third-party data have led to discrepancies in branch accounts,
through erroneous TCs being issued on Subpostmasters.

Third Party Data

Agreed

PO does not control the level of errors made by its third-party client
organisations (which may lead to errors in TCs), or the delays in their
processes (which may lead to delays in TCs).
