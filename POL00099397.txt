The branch have come back to request a “screen shot” of the authorisation request. How much angst would be involved
in recreating what it would have looked like?

Subject: Gilmerton and East Ham

For Gilmerton, Dave has a bit more info which may be of interest. Having checked the file AIS in more detail:

W_032026.TP_
DCS 2775  21AA593086 3  2RABOO3 201302011351120135212030NN 34197 1 1 -
371.00 -1 HX 37100589 GBP 0100-148824-2-3584068-

1 21 71154881 475116000000303920130201010 117543 0171000698001111

The highlighted text (S89) is the authorisation code as entered by the Clerk. As you know, this is usually six digits
whereas in this case it was just three. Either the clerk did the referral and then incorrectly entered the auth code or just
entered a random number. No way to tell the difference.

As for the original East Ham: 194002, Transaction date: 23/10/12, 09:20 Value: £2,703.95. As mentioned previously, we
don’t have direct access to audit to allow us to pull back the Credence feed file but we have managed to determine
which feed file to Credence the transaction you want would have been in. If you’re unable to get anything out of
Credence for it, best suggestion | have is if you get your security team to make an ARQ request saying that you want

POL-0098980
POL00099397
POL00099397

“Any TIP feed files for Credence on 23/10/12 with a file name starting with “W_297036.TP_”. Put my name in the frame
as well and then if our litigation team are not sure they can contact me.

The litigation bit is all to do with chain of evidence for prosecutions and delivery in court. I’m sensitive about it because
in the distant past one of my team was “persuaded” (by our side, not yours) to write an evidence statement without
fully understanding the implications. As you know, our “professional witness” for these types of cases is Gareth Jenkins
but in this case, because process was not followed, Gareth couldn’t do it and preparation for court became very difficult.

| would think that HSD would send the call to us for guidance or have a script that says similar, {’m too remote from
them to be sure. Anyway, always happy to send you details that allow you to complete the investigation. At least them
you'll know that the information required is there and what form it takes. You can define the evidence to your security
team for any subsequent litigation request and they can just re-obtain the detail the official way. All transaction data is
in the audit trail for 7 years. The only thing that disappears after a given time is support information ~ that includes
detailed counter diagnostic logs (from which we can determine button press information) which are only on the counter
30 days.

Right, must stop being diverted by more interesting things like this and get on with my finance forecast (yawn!)

I think that is all | need. ft is all | would puil if it was within 3 months.

Good point about litigation. | am aware that any evidence we put in front of a court must come through the right
channel. | am dealing well before this point but have to be aware that any case may end up min court. | will typically
say something like “I’ve asked Fujitsu to investigate and they have confirmed that a referral was made to your Horizon
system.........” So something like that might get waved around in court but the transactional data presented would need
to come through approved channels.

Clearly it gives more weight to my responses if | can show | have investigated properly. | guess if an enquiry like this
came through HSD they would give a similar but verbal response?

Appreciate this.

Andy,

Initial information on Gilmerton (148824) shows that the transaction was a referral. Still working

NOTE: Not trying to teach you to suck eggs but thought I’d remind you that none of the information we dig out for you

Hi Steve

Would you be able to assist with this one? I’ve been trying for months to get the referral info from the raw logs as per
Gareth’s advice without success.

Ironically | have had a subsequent challenge from fad 148824 relating to a debit card MOP of £371 on 1" Feb. Is this
something that can be relatively easily pulled within the 6 month window when detailed data moves into archive?

Appreciate any help

Hi

Ineed an enhanced ARQ to interrogate Horizon records to determine if a debit card authorisation code was system
generated or manually input to Horizon for the above branch. The raw logs should indicate a referral message being
shown. See detailed requirement in e mail chain below.

Transaction date: - 23/10/12, 9.20, £2,703.95

Andy,

When requesting an ARQ, POL can ask for additional info. When that happens, the guys in Fujitsu processing the
request often come to me asking if the request can be made. At that point | can then tell them if the info is in the raw
logs and advise of any additional charges to pull that out as a 1-off. If this is the sort of thing you might want regularly,
then the POL security team could raise a CR (Change Request) to enhance the info in the standard report to include an
additional field (eg resp_code).

Hi Gareth

We have found the field in Credence but the report only goes back 90 days so we can’t access summary data it seems. |
was hoping that if there was only the one transaction in the day | would have seen enough.

Do you know what route | should take to request the raw logs? Don’t go hunting if you don’t, | can start trawling here.

Andy,
The field you want is Resp_code.

This isn’t in the standard ARQ extract, but is available in the raw logs. It is also passed to Credence (as
RESPONSE_CODE), but | don’t know if it is visible in the Credence reports.

POL-0098980
POL00099397
POL00099397

A value of 10 indicates that the MA has requested a Referral, which means the Branch phoning up for an Auth Code
which they then key in. There is no way we can confirm if the bamk was phoned or a random value keyed in, but this
would at least indicated that there was a Referral.

| have access to data up to 6 month old (which should have included resp_code}, but I see that we’ve just missed that
timeframe.

If you can’t get RESPONSE_CODE from Credence, then you could request the raw logs (not part of the standard ARQ). If
this is likely to be a common requirement, then amending the standard ARQ to include Resp_code would be a simple
change, but require a CR.

Hi Gareth

This is a scenario | have had before were we have issued a TC to a branch on a bureau card payment where our card
processor state that no authorisation call was made (implying that the branch manually input an authorisation code that
was not provided from the card processor) whereas the branch are adamant that authorisation was automatically

provided.

We normally do not progress these but I’m being put under pressure to provide evidence on this one. This may be the
type of enquiry we get from 2" Sight anyway so thought | would raise an ARQ.

I can’t see any more detail from what | got in Credence. Is there any way we can see the key strokes that would support
a manual authorisation being input?
