No problem.

I'll set up the LGQC meeting [I am assuming he is in London — I have asked Rob] and I'll meet you at OEC. Timings to
follow.

In relation to the LNQC 5.15 call I am seeking confirmation. I believe that will all work and Rob will confirm.

Rob will (I hope) also line up DCQC for the two meetings/call.

As to the Board call at 5.15, do you want DCQC there in person at FD ? Do you wish me to be there ?

We (you, me & DCQC) have higher level thoughts on appeal strategy — but that forensic work has been (rightly)
sequenced behind the more urgent recusal work that took place over the w/e and will (I predict) dominate this week
too.

See you later.

Hi Tom

Many thanks to you and the team for the help over the weekend. As flagged, I would
like to meet Lord Grabiner this afternoon if that’s possible - happy for it to be at OEC,
and escorted by whoever you think is appropriate! The purpose is to check in with
him, his level,of confidence on the recusal application.

In addition, we need to confirm t he call with Lord Neuberger. To that end would
upheaval find it helpful to have a quick briefing beforehand? I suspect the Board will
want to understand how the recusal application plays into the wider appeal strategy,
the legal risks of not proceeding, and his level of confidence - albeit based on a quick
review.

I’m on my way into the office, and will be there by 8; am then in meetings until about
10 when I will head over to court.

Many thanks,

Jane
