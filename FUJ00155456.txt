Subject: CP0336 - Enable analysis of Counter event messages within the HNG-X Audit solution

The development impact on this CP was based on retaining a contractor, starting work at the beginning of April and
delivering before end June 2009. This CP urgently needs to progress through the boards for approval if we are to
achieve this.

If approval of this CP is delayed the development impact is likely to increase as we will need to retain the contractor
beyond the end of June or find less skilled resource who will take longer to do the work.
