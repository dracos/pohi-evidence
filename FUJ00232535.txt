(Case Law 7 & 8 were'settled for £9/558'63 Credit note-number-020 48/9/02.

‘Case Law 4 & 5 were Settléd for £9;075:00 Credit note number 0301244 07/1/03

I agree that no settlement was made for Case Law 6. (Confirmed in a letter from Colin dated 13/9/02)

As far as I'm aware credits were not raised for 1, 2, or 3. I can't be 100% sure because they have various descriptions
Colin - can you confirm what was agreed with POL on these

Regards .

Claire

Claire,

I have a non urgent request, and have been told that you may be able to help. I.am trying to catch up on some
work I have been putting off, and so have been going through emails that I have-been saving for later.

What I am trying to do is see where were are with Case Law issues. I realise that Case Law 9 has been settled,
and have the invoice ref. I was wondering if you could help on the some of the others?

Case Law 7, and 8. According to letter from CLS to Mike Hannan we agrees to settle for £5156.60, and
£4402.03. Can you find out when this credit was issued, and the credit note ref?

Case Law 6: We told POL in January of this year we would not accept liability so no need to action here

Case Law 4, and 5: We offered to settle on both (they are related) for £9075.00. My email stream has since dried
out on this (last email was Jan 6 2003). Do you know if this was settled, and if so what was the credit note was
issued, and the ref.

Case Law 2, and 3: POL agreed there was no issue after all, and these were closed with out settlement. That is
unless you something I don't.

Case Law 1: This one is going back a bit, but the only information I have was that this was removed from Case
1
