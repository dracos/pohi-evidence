Pete

Please find attached my weekly report. As you will see no work has been undertaken in the audit room this
week. As a result the ARQ OLA may again be breached as a result of my absence from the office.

Also, as a result of Steve Evans and Alan Holmes note concerning the Audit CP and the
witness statement content I do not believe we should send any further standard witness
statements until we have had the chance to discuss what was said last week and the
implictions. I currently have 3 outstanding.

Regards
Penny
