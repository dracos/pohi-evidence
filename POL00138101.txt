BC provided an update on the programme in terms
of administration, governance, stakeholders, legal
and risk level. AVDB confirmed she was comfortable
with the number of investigators now in place
however there is an issue with retrieving information
from Fujitsu to progress the cases within the agreed
timescales. AH explained there is now a Fujitsu
project manager in place that will work with the
investigators to put a forward plan in place and
manage the data requests, however we may still
experience issues with large requests for data and
therefore we need to prioritise the requests. CA
specified that an early warning signal is required
where data may not be forthcoming. Action: build
feedback mechanism in so that BC can flag
Fujitsu data delays to the Working Group and
request an extension as early as possible.

BC outlined the quality assurance (QA) process for
reviewing CQRs and investigators’ reports. CA
highlighted:

1. AH has indicated the Post Office reports are
coming across defensive. The reports need to
be more balanced and this needs to be
managed through QA.

2. Inorder to satisfy the JFSA’s broader demands
we need to demonstrate we are taking actions
to make improvements based on themes arising
from the cases

BC summarised the work the programme is doing to

address the second point:

1. Mapping the themes that Second Sight have
already identified against the Business
Improvement activities

2. Apaper on the lessons learned so far (to
ARC 12/02)

3. The Independent Resolution of Future
Cases workstream to investigate and
develop a permanent independent
complaints handling procedure for the Post
Office

The Board recognised the programme is closely

linked to and has a major dependency with the

Business Improvement programme, but there is no

single document that shows how the two will drive

the desired outcomes. Action: BC and ADVB to
document and provide an update at the next

Programme Board.

CC/his deputy were unable to join the Board to
provide an update on the financial outlook. It was
unclear whether all the work within the programme

Resolution of Future Cases workstreams. Action:
CC to provide clarification and circulate detailed
budget.

DO and NM left the room whilst the Board discussed
PA's Proposal (slide 11). Action: BC to follow-up

AP outlined the Early Settlement Policy. The Board
was requested to review the detailed policy and
provide any comments back to AP; to be approved
by correspondence unless it needs to be discussed
further in which case it should be on the agenda for
the next Programme Board. Action: ALL to review
and provide any comments to AP by 24 January.
AVDB highlighted how early settlement could be
perceived as counterproductive:

1. It may appear that the Post Office are not
interested in trying to resolve the root
problem/make business improvements.

2. Could result in making decisions on
incomplete information

Action: Raise as a risk and ensure suitable
mitigating actions and owners are in place.
