FW: Advanced Draft of Report

Susan,
Singh:

No change in advice, i.e. need to do a case-by-case review.

CK have flagged the same para’s we’ve identified as troublesome re: our disclosure to SS and SS’s conclusions
Ck haven’t articulated what their concerns are

No comment on how the Interim Report could be used by discguntled SPMs (I’ve already gone back to them
on this)

Sensitivity: Confidential

Dear Hugh,

Thanks for letting us have a copy of this.

Our advice overall with regard to disclosure has not changed. The disclosure of a partial report
would not meet with our duties or help the current situation. I think the disclosure of a partial
report would provide partial information and give rise to adverse publicity and speculation. It
would be far better to advise once we have seen the entire report. Having said that the Second
Sight report would not need to be disclosed in every case - that decision would be taken on a case-

by-case basis. In many cases it will not be disclosable.

When do you think we will get to see all of the Spot Reports. We will undoubtedly have a list of
questions thereafter. At the present time we have some concerns arising out of the draft, for
example in relation to paras 5.6, 6.1, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.8, 6.10, 6.11 and 7.2.

Although we cannot properly advise until we have seen all of the relevant material, this will not
prevent the review process from proceeding with expedition. We propose to draft paramaters

which will work on a worst case scenario.

Kind regards,

Martin.
