I am the person named above and I reside at the address stated overleaf. I am employed by
Royal Mail Group as an Advanced Customer Advisor on the Network Business Support
Centre (NBSC) Helpdesk at Dearne House, Barnsley and have been so since July 2004.
Part of my responsibilities within this role is to answer telephone calls and record on the
Post Office Limited Remedy helpdesk logging system problems or queries reported by Post
Office Branches. I also have previous Post Office Branch experience having worked in a Sub
Post Office for five years prior to my present role. I therefore have an understanding of the

losses and gains procedures.

Calls are logged on the Remedy system in the first instance as a Tier 1 call and the
operator will upgrade the call and pass it to a Tier 2 operator to deal with if they are unable
to resolve the problem. It is my responsibility to deal with Tier 2 enquiries which are usually
more complex than routine calls and will include problems with losses and gains. If a call
was received in relation to losses and gains it would be recorded under the following

headings:

I now produce exhibit LS/01 which is a log from the Remedy system relating to the calls
recorded as received by Rowlands Castle Post Office between 01 June 2010 and
05/04/2011. I can see from this exhibit that there are records of 33 calls made to the NBSC
from the Rowlands Castle branch. Of these there are two which fall under one of the
aforementioned headings, which may relate to losses and gains at the office. The first call,
made on 02 July 2010 refers to A CO OP cash deposit which was accepted incorrectly at
the branch as an Alliance and Leicester deposit and the branch has now received a
Transaction Correction notice. The resolution of this inquiry advises that the deposit should
not have been accepted and the cash and deposit slip handed back to the customer. The
second call under one of these headings was made on 16 November 2010 and refers to the

branch remitting in stock from a previous Trading Period. The resolution shows the entry

‘KB’ which means Knowledge Base which is information on the system which advisors can
gain access to give the relevant information to the caller.
Various other calls appear on the log LS/01 however none appear to be in relation to the
reporting of cash shortage in the accounts or anything that would immediately appear to

indirectly cause a large cash shortage in the accounts.
