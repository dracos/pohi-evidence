John, presumably there’s no record of the reason they were deleted? So no way of distinguishing the now irrelevant
due to permanent fixes from the deleted because the KEL was wrong in the first place other than by looking at them
individually?

Horizon deleted KELs — 1281
HNG-X deleted KELs ~ 212

Please note however that some KELs would have been deleted because they were wrongly raised as well as those out
of date. So we cannot confirm that all the information in these is valid i.e. If the SMC raised a KEL wrongly the SSC may
well have deleted it as such. Therefore I have reservations about supplying an export of deleted KELs.

John,
CS/FSP/006 has been withdrawn, but I think more comprehensive is SVM/SDM/PRO/0875 End to End Application
Support Strategy, section 11.2.5 KEL deletion:
11.2.5 KEL deletion
KELs should be deleted when:
+ The function they refer to no longer exists in the live System
+ itis a duplicate of an existing KEL with the same problem and resolution.
+ The KEL contains misteading information and no update is appropriate.
KELs can only be deleted by members of the SSC. If you think a KEL should be deleted then update the

ee cote ee nee eh tie ee ee DELETED: Reason’ and specify
“Reason”. The SSC diagnostician you direct the update authorisation to will then check and delete the
KEL if they agree on the reason.

That last bit about agreeing deletion has I think been superseded by SVM/SDM/STP/3289 TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR
POA KEL APPROVAL FORUM which includes in its remit “That issue, time or service expired KEL’s are retired or
archived (deactivated).”

Happy for me to point them at those two docs instead? (which they will have.)
Sounds Good

On question 4, do you mean no, they are not currently text searchable in the archive, but complete KELs could be
located and copied, so in principle they could be retrieved and therefore made searchable? Are all deleted KELs still
in the database archive table, or is that unknown?

Correct, they are not available to be searched.

The KELs can be retrieved however this will require time and effort.

I believe that all deleted KELs are still in the archive table.

Hi Matthew,
1. Is that procedure a general rule?
Yes
2. If so, is it enshrined in a formal process?
KELs can be active, deactivated or deleted.
Active are available to search
Deactivated are not included in the default search but may be included via a search option.
Deleted are removed for the KEL table but copied to an archive table, these are not searchable.
Deletion is reserved for when the KEL is incorrectly raised or when they are definitely no longer required such as a
platform is retired (e.g. the move from Riposte to the Branch database).

3. If so, which - and do we have the corresponding documentation?

The end to end support process document (CS/FSP/006) just states:
“known error” system to be maintained, up to date with the current SSC knowledge.

4. Are all deleted KELs available in a searchable archive? I assume that text could, in principle, be retrieved
from other KELs.

No, however they are still in the database archive table.

Regards
John

Matthew,

We have sent the two KELs for Callendar Square to our IT experts. They have come back with the following
questions for you relating to KELs being deleted when the corresponding issues are fixed:

1. Is that procedure a general rule?
2. If so, is it enshrined in a formal process?
3. If so, which - and do we have the corresponding documentation?

4. Are all deleted KELs available in a searchable archive? I assume that text could, in principle, be retrieved
from other KELs.

If you could let me have your responses urgently that would be great, as we have a call with the IT experts this
morning.

Kind regards,

Lucy

Lucy,
We have looked into this, and it appears that the relevant Peaks are PCO126042 and PCO126376, attached.

The two related KELs were deleted, due to the fact that the S90 Release was proven to have fixed the issue, and they
so would not be included in the set of KELs which you have.

We have been able to retrieve the text from one them however, as attached, KEL JSimpkins338Q.

GRO.

Thanks Matthew.

I've had a look at the information and there is reference in Gareth Jenkins witness statement to an email in appendix c
of Charles McLachlan's report. I've gone through the report but cannot see it included — are you able to send me a
copy of all of appendix c? Gareth also refers to a previous witness statement on 8 February 2010 — do you have a
copy of this?

Also, the report itself contains track changes — do you have a final copy?
Kind regards,
Lucy

Lucy,
The attached email I sent to you in July included the zip file that was originally provided to Second Sight, and which
includes information relating to the Calendar Square case.

I don’t believe there is a related KEL, but I will check for other information.

Matthew, Pete,

You may recall a while ago that I asked you to provide information on Calendar Square, Falkirk. Apologies if I have
missed your response, however I think this request may still be outstanding. Please could you provide me with any
information you have on this. Could you also confirm whether KELs exist for this bug?
