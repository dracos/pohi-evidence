turnaround’ CT’s.[Does Colin accept this action? I thought we said
we would look into the ones in the period not try to stop next lot
happening? I

[JC took an action to issue revised scorecard for one section that I
can’t remember but we should record action here shouldn’t we?]

[Did Colin take an action to arrange a discussion with Keith to see
how we can avoid Julie Wolstenholmes” in the future? — I have it
noted as a non-urgent action]

[I think I should have an action to arrange for suspension of CR
POLCC_FSL_CR0015. Also an action (easier to make it separate) to
send a draft of some amended wording to SG which we will agree
off-line before we formally submit a CCN. Suspension date can be
26/03 but date for sending drafting no earlier than next forum please]
