Scrap it and start again!!!
Seriously, provide a template of the detail you need to cover your witness statement requirements.
Ensure that Sec Ops have the correct access to produce such reports.

Advise that we (Fujitsu) are contractually obliged to provide these records 7 years after creation and they need to be
held securely with integrity maintained.

Can I have your thoughts on improvements to TFS so we can forward them on to Suzie, here are a few to start with...

She would like these today..

* Do we need to RESOLVE and CLOSE calls

* The need to be able to access old/archived calls/data directly without having to log call to get the data
extracted

* The format of live call reports differs to the retrieved archived data
