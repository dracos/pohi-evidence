Hi thanks. Only query from me is that this says the opposite to what I said to Alice re the proposed changed role of SS!
ie., as discussed at last week's Sparrow meeting - they will now provide verification of the case reports, not write them. I
hope we haven't changed back? She is expecting them to be with us longer but on reduced scope. And therefore within
a similar budget.

Our budget is under severe threat on Sparrow because of the case numbers. (Before any compensation decisions.)
Should she mention this to make the point to Tony that it cannot be open ended / public purse etc? (Not re his costs but
helping manage ours)

I wondered about reminding Alice that Hillsborough was 'resolved' by my conversation with Tony, in case he raised it.
But not for Alice to mention.
