Dear Sir / Madam
Continued late disclosure by POL: Phase 4 hearings and witnesses

1. We refer to Post Office Limited's (POL’s) ongoing late disclosure of relevant documents said to be
responsive to Rule 9 requests, Section 21 Notices or otherwise of interest to the Inquiry in relation to Phase
4 and/or Phase 4 individual witnesses.

2. We understand that POL's Counsel has recently asked Counsel to the Inquiry for the names of witnesses
for the remainder of the Phase 4 hearings in order to continue POL’s various disclosure exercises resulting
in the late disclosure of documents.

3. The Inquiry provides a provisional list of names in Annex 1 to this letter. Please note this is a provisional
list of individuals that the Inquiry wishes to call (or obtain a statement from) and should not be taken as
confirmation that those persons will in fact provide evidence or information to the Inquiry.

4. For the avoidance of doubt, the purpose of providing POL with this information is to ensure prompt
disclosure of any further late documents in respect of overdue Rule 9 requests, Section 21 Notices or other
documents of interest in order to ensure that the Inquiry's hearings can remain listed as scheduled, if at all
possible.

5. POL must disclose any additional documents by the following deadlines:
(a) Any additional documents said to be related to Stephen Bradshaw by 4.00pm 20 December 2023.
(b) For all other persons in Annex 1, no later than 4.00pm 10 January 2024. If POL is able to disclose
documents earlier than this, then they ought to do so by upload to Egress in the usual way.

6. This letter is marked as strictly private and confidential and is captured by the terms of the Inquiry’s
undertakings. POL is only to use the information in Annex 1 for the reasons contained in this letter (ie. to
facilitate the prompt disclosure of any further late documents).

7. The final timetable for the additional Phase 4 hearings to be held in January will be provided to Core
Participants and published on the website shortly.
