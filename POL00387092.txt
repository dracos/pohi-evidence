Dear Mr Bailey

Post Office Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme Update

In light of your Committee’s current Inquiry, I am writing to inform you of a recent decision
we have made regarding the Post Office Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme.

Having completed all our investigations into individual cases, which have found no
evidence of a system-wide issue with Horizon, we have decided to now put forward for
mediation all cases remaining in the scheme except those that have been subject to a
previous court ruling. This will accelerate the conclusion of the Scheme in the interests of
applicants while ensuring that we fulfil the commitments made to them at the outset.

I enclose a copy of my letter to the Minister for Employment and Consumer Affairs, which
provides further detail, as well as the press notice we have issued today.

Please do not hesitate to let me know if you have any questions, or if you would like any
further information.

Yours sincerely

Paula Vennells
Chief Executive
