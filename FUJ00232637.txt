Project Summary FUjITSU

Fujitsu identified business case to move all ADSL IP Stream customers to Next
Generation Network - with migration project ROI now under 12 months.

Post Office + Fujitsu joint ‘Solihull’ workshop on 11 Feb confirmed agreement for:
* circa 70% of PO connections move to TalkTalk Technology LLU

circa 30% of PO connections move to BT Wholesale IP Stream Connect

* 2x new high bandwidth TT interconnects provided by Fujitsu Telecoms
* Session termination continued to be provided by Fujitsu UK&l

¢ Horizon connections continue to use C&W (Energis) for transport to IRE11/19

¢ AEI connections continue to use Fujitsu Cloud Network (FCN) for transport to
Cogent/Phoenix data centres in Bristol and Farnborough.

¢ Branch Network Variable reductions of circa £600k PA (£50k per month).
¢ TalkTalk Business work 24x7 and offer Fujitsu the same SLA as BT Wholesale.

Preparatory Work FUJITSU

Full technical audit of TalkTalk Technology infrastructure (under NDA) to confirm
design and implementation was suitable for Fujitsu customer requirements.

Maximise the Post Office backup network coverage by resolving all outstanding
issues with Wireless and ISDN backup switchover.

Basic testing of AE] and Horizon systems (identified Horizon router cpu issue) — full
testing in March (identified AEI router firmware issue). Both issues resolved
before live site migrations.

Telecoms inventory cleansing (matching Fujitsu RMGA SYSMAN2+3, Fujitsu
Telepurchase and BT Wholesale inventories) — happens every 3 months.

Plan migration schedule (to achieve 10 day TTB migration order notice and 4 day
migration cancel timelines) — Fujitsu pulled less than 50 x PO migration orders.

Formally agree migration project Customer commercials, etc.

Things that went well... FUJITSU

Post Office communication with Postmasters and other stakeholders.
TalkTalk Business provided excellent UK based 24x7 support.

Excellent joint working within Fujitsu (RMG Account and Shared Service teams)
maintaining perfect balance of service quality Vs project timeline.

Migration period backup network costs (less than ADSL savings each month)
Fault volumes under control (never an unacceptable fault volume concurrency)
Fujitsu achieved all Branch Network SLAs during the migration period.

AEI router firmware issue (1 week software distribution and 1 week software
commit) accommodated within existing project timeline — no slippage.

Domain Migration — bulk move of all Radius/PPP connection to TT interconnects
Maintaining project team commitment and determination through migration period.

Fujitsu UK&l custom scripts to validate Post Office post migration sync status to
enable proactive fault raising.

Service Introduction (using standard RMGA templates) to ensure that Fujitsu service
delivery unit operational processes are updated.

TalkTalk and BT escalation routes for non-standard fault conditions.

Considerations for future... FUJITSU

High operation change request admin — MSCs for Horizon and AEI each week.
Sites can be moved to diagnostic / ultra-conservative profile where required.

700 more exchanges coming online for LLU — estimated £45k PA of future savings.
