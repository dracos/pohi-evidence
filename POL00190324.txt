Rodric,

Please find associated a report from our Fraud Analyst, Helen Rose, in respect of
Lepton SPSO. This office doesn’t feature as part of our 2™ Sight Spot Reviews,
but the subject matter is Horizon (and indeed Credence) related. Could I ask
that you consider the report and feed any comments back, as it could be a
potential issue at some stage.

In summary, the specifics concern a ‘system reversal’ of a transaction following
a system failure. This is normal practice, but the Horizon logs (and Credence

POL-BSFF-0028387
POL00190324
POL00190324

logs) indicate that the reversal is an ‘existing reversal’, implying that the
reversal was manually entered by the clerk/Subpostmaster.

I think there’s a remote possibility that this could be a problem in terms of
using the data for evidence/prosecution purposes, but nevertheless it is still a

possibility. Myself or Helen are happy to talk through anything that requires
explanation.

Regards,
