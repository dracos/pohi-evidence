Lo

Penny
Thanks for this. A couple of points:

1> Can you advise which type of reversal ‘1’ entries relate to in the ‘Reversal’ column and likewise for ’2’
entries, I’m assuming one of then will reflect new reversals the other existing reversals but I just need
this confirmed and which no. relates to which.

2> The October data is duplicated in both ARQ 066 & 067. As such can you supply September data
please which relates to ARQ 066.

I have only looked at this from a perspective of identifying reversals and now having the additional
‘Reversal’ column it would appear that this has resolved the issue.

Thanks.

completing their checks. We will provide post-tested records for Court use asap.

I have spoken to Graham and the office concerned is Bishops Hull 157/549

He goes on leave on Friday so would like the data before then in order for him to do the analysis, will

this give you chance to “test” it?
Also can I ask that the discs are sent direct to him.

know the priorities but to be honest Penny it won't be today

Jane
Thank you for your note.

I have investigated this issue and find that unfortunately, for the HNG-X migrated outlets for which we
have returned transaction records, the reversal cannot be directly linked to the original transaction. In
HNG-X there is a reversal indicator which needs to be included in our returns in order to identify
whether the reversal is directly linked to another transaction or not.

Our queries have been modified and are in the process of being tested; we are expecting these
enhanced queries to be available at the beginning of next week.

We have identified that 68 of our returns are for HNG-X migrated outlets and a comprehensive list is
attached. In the event that this detail is required for previously returned records we will be ina
position to do so shortly. Should there be multiple records to reproduce then we will need to identify
priorities.

Kind regards
Penny

Sorry to bother you with another issue.

Email string below but the gist of it is that Graham Brander wants to know how to identify reversals
and why they don’t now appear as one of the modes?

I'm afraid it means nothing to me which is why I asked someone else to contact Graham but clearly
the answer isn’t sufficient.

Is this something that you would be able to help me with?
Regards

Jane

PS Is it home time yet?

Thanks for looking into.
Jane

I've had a chat with Helen and it isn’t clear at all how we identify reversals. As this is going to be
needed for just about every data request made can you ask Fujitsu to explain in simple terms how we
identify reversals and why these don’t now appear as one of the modes?

Thanks.
