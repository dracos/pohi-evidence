                                                                               WITN04450100




      information to enable the facts to be gathered to ascertain if any criminal

      offence had taken place.

5. i have been asked to describe the process of an investigation by the fraud

   team. The process is as follows:

      a. Any enquiry would go into the casework team, it would then be

          assigned via the Line Manager in the first instance to an Investigator in

         the area, depending on their current workload it could be assigned to

         an Investigator in another area.

      b. Contact made (either in person or via a telephone call) with the person

         to be interviewed / suspect to arrange an interview, their legal rights

         would be explained over the phone or in person together with the Post

         Office agreement that a Post Office Friend (normally their Union Rep)

         could also attend. A suitable time, place and date would be agreed for

         an interview to take place. This would be confirmed in a letter to the

         person who was to be interviewed.

         Team (CLT) or Cartwright King when they took over to see if the

         evidence was sufficient for a successful prosecution. If the advice was

         for a prosecution, charging advice would be received, case would be

         booked into the Magistrates, summons obtained, service and the

         normal court process then takes place. If there was no plea or a not

         guilty plea entered a committal bundle would be prepared. If any

                                                                                        WITN04450100




              further evidence came to light this would be served on the defence by

              the CLT or Cartwright King together with a statement formally

              exhibiting the items.



   6. All information would be passed to the Financial Investigator for confiscation,

       if court case costs via prosecution barrister / solicitor would be applied for

      and if interviewee / suspect had agreed to repay any monies details of

      account for monies to be paid into would be provided and on occasions

       person would send cheques directly and these paid into a Bank of Ireland

      account.

Relationship with Fujitsu

   7. Any information required from Fujitsu would be requested via the casework

      team. Any contact with members of Fujitsu if they had provided a statement

      would be as a matter of the court process in they may be required as a

      witness. I do not recall any particular conversations or dialogue with members

      of Fujitsu.

   8. I do not recall having any direct contact with any Fujitsu engineers. I have

      seen the documents listed (FUJ00122938 and FUJ00122939) and can only

      assume contact was made as a result of advice form the Criminal Law Team.

          a. I do know of any process in contacting any engineers.

          b. I have been asked why it was "against process for investigators to

             approach Fujitsu engineers direct". As stated in paragraph 'a' I do not

             know what is meant by "against process to approach engineers direct".

          c. Jane Owen was part of the casework team and I do not recall what her

             specific role was in any due process.

                                                                                     WITN04450100




          d. As far as I am aware any due process would always be followed.

         e. As stated I do not recall having any direct contact with Fujitsu

             engineers, there may have be occasions when I have attended court

             and members of Fujitsu have been called.

   9. I do not fully know what Gareth Jenkins' role was within Fujitsu.

   10. I did not know that Gareth Jenkins was considered to be an expert witness.

      My understanding of an expert witness is a person who has greater

      knowledge in their particular field than the ordinary person. I may have

      spoken with him when at the same court, but I do not recall having any

      discussions with him regarding his role.

Relationship with others

   11.Any contact with Cartwright King Solicitors would have been purely a working

      relationship basis. I do not recall which lawyer I dealt with for each case.

   12. Any involvement with the NFSP was on a working relationship basis.

Reports & Investigations

The case of Michael Mann

   13. An enquiry concerning St Annes Post Office was assigned to me. The

      amount of stock purported to have been returned to Swindon did not tally with

      the amount of stock received in the pouch. The stock pouches would have

      been checked by the stock centre.

   14. Ms Helen Rose was a work colleague within the Security Team and

      performed whatever role was necessary within the team.

   15. Ms Rose always behaved in a competent, professional and impeccable

      manner at all times.

   16. I am not aware of any involvement Ms Rose may have had.

   17. I do not recall seeing or reading document FUJ00086811.

Second Sight

   18. 1 do not recall being involved with Second Sight.

   19. 1 have been asked if I am aware that allegations were made about my

      conduct to Second Sight.

         a. I was not previously aware of any allegations made about my conduct.

             I have now read document POL00099689 and I can categorically state

             that I have never said to any person I have interviewed and definitely

             not to Jacqueline McDonald that she was the only one in that position.

             I refute the allegation that I am a liar, I do not know who she was

             friends with or if they were involved with the JFSA.

         b. I also refute the claim that Jacqueline McDonald was bullied, from the

             moment we arrived, the auditor was already on site, conversations

             were initially with Mr McDonald, the reason for our attendance was

             explained, Mr and Mrs McDonald were kept updated as the day

             progressed.

         c. Ms Katie Noblet was not bullied and was spoken to as part of the

             investigation to establish the facts of the discrepancy in the accounts. I

             am not sure what Jacqueline McDonald means that she (Katie Noblet)

            was running the Post Office under somebody's name and was bullied

             about wage deductions or jail time. Post Office Ltd could not deduct

             any monies from Katie Noblet wages as she was either paid by her

                                                                                              WITNO4450100




                 employer (Jaqueline McDonald) or her new employer the person she

                 was allegedly running the Post Office for on their behalf.

             d. Ms Katie Noblet was not being bullied but was being asked if she

                 would provide a statement as part of the on-going investigation. Ms

                 Richards would be seeing how she was coping in running the Post

                 Office branch when Mr McDonald asked us to leave the shop.

             e. Ms Jacqueline McDonald is also incorrect in stating Post Office

                 Investigators behaved like Mafia Gangsters looking to collect their

                 bounty with the threats and lies.

            f.   I would be grateful if I could have a copy from Jacqueline McDonald of

                 her notes of when these threats and lies were made to her.

            g. Ms McDonald made no mention or made any allegation or comments

                 against myself or my colleagues regarding our behaviour, either during

                 the investigation, at the interview stage (although she did bring a friend

                 who was present throughout the interview) or in court by her barrister

                 or solicitor to either the trial judge or the prosecution barrister. I am

                 also not aware of any complaint being received by POL from Ms

                 McDonald.

R V Janet Skinner

    20. I have been asked to set out my recollection of these proceedings and been

        referred to a number of documents'. I was second officer to the Lead

   Investigator on this enquiry. The Lead Investigator would ask the questions

   but if appropriate on occasions the second officer would also ask questions.

   At the end of the interview as the second officer I would normally oversee the

   signing of the tape seals and the sealing of the master copy. Any forms that

   need completing including NPA1 (Non-Police Agencies) a Notification of

   Proceedings to Police and Antecedents. The Lead Investigator would submit

   the file.

21. There were no concerns, the investigation was conducted in a professional

   manner at all times.

22. I do not have any other reflections about this matter.

23. 1 have looked at INQ00001035 at p25 (internal pages 97 and 98) and I can

   categorically state that I have never said to any person I have interviewed

   and definitely not to Janet Skinner "we have dealt with people who have

   stolen from Post Offices before and like you, we know you haven't done

   anything". I did not have the jurisdiction to say anything like this nor would I

   ever make this type of comments to anybody. At the end of an interview the

   person would be informed of the next stages, i.e. a report would be done, and

   the file sent off for advice and any decision would be made by the Legal

   Department.

R v Hug hie Thomas

        24. 1 have been asked to set out my recollection of these proceedings and been

            referred to a number of documents2. I was second officer to the Lead

            Investigator on this enquiry. A telephone call was received concerning an

           audit shortage at Gaerwen Post Office branch. I travelled to Anglesey with

           the Lead Investigator. Advice was taken from the Team Leader at the time,

            Mr Thomas was taken by North Wales Police Offices to Holyhead where he

           was interviewed.

       25. There were no concerns, the investigation was conducted in a professional

           manner at all times.

       26. I have no other reflections about this matter.

R v Ishag

       27. l have been asked to set out my recollection of these proceedings and been

           referred to a number of documents3. This enquiry was assigned to me and

           concerned a discrepancy in the accounts.

     28.There were no concerns, the investigation was conducted in a professional

         manner at all times.

     29. I have no other reflections about this matter.

     30. I have been asked about the appropriateness of "placing the burden" on the

         defendant to "fully particularise" any problems with Horizon before further

        disclosure was made (POL00046234). I do not consider this to be a burden

        on the Defendant as this enquiry concerned discrepancies due to the amount

        of stock that should be on hand compared to the actual amount on hand.

     31. I have been asked about the appropriateness of the statement that POL "had

        absolute confidence in the robustness and integrity of its Horizon system and

        mentioned in this meeting as having carried out an "independent

        investigation". It was assigned to me as an enquiry due to the branch having

        a high volume of spoilt postage labels. Mr Walters (the Postmaster) was

        interviewed in accordance with PACE. It was established they were unsure of

        the procedures and what the difference is between a spoilt label (when

        payment is expected) and a rejected label (when no payment is due). The

        matter was dealt with by the Contracts team and no further action was taken

        by the Security Team.
