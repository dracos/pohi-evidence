5. | have been asked to describe the process of an investigation by the fraud
team. The process is as follows:

team. Any contact with members of Fujitsu if they had provided a statement
would be as a matter of the court process in they may be required as a
witness. | do not recall any particular conversations or dialogue with members
of Fujitsu.

8. | do not recall having any direct contact with any Fujitsu engineers. | have
seen the documents listed (FUJ00122938 and FUJ00122939) and can only
assume contact was made as a result of advice form the Criminal Law Team.

a. | do know of any process in contacting any engineers.

b. I have been asked why it was “against process for investigators to
approach Fujitsu engineers direct”. As stated in paragraph ‘a’ | do not
know what is meant by “against process to approach engineers direct”.

specific role was in any due process.

d. As far as | am aware any due process would always be followed.

e. As stated | do not recall having any direct contact with Fujitsu
engineers, there may have be occasions when | have attended court
and members of Fujitsu have been called.

9. I do not fully know what Gareth Jenkins’ role was within Fujitsu.

10.1 did not know that Gareth Jenkins was considered to be an expert witness.
My understanding of an expert witness is a person who has greater
knowledge in their particular field than the ordinary person. | may have
spoken with him when at the same court, but I do not recall having any
discussions with him regarding his role.

Relationship with others

11.Any contact with Cartwright King Solicitors would have been purely a working
relationship basis. | do not recall which lawyer | dealt with for each case.

12. Any involvement with the NFSP was on a working relationship basis.

Reports & Investigations

The case of Michael Mann

13. An enquiry concerning St Annes Post Office was assigned to me. The
amount of stock purported to have been returned to Swindon did not tally with
the amount of stock received in the pouch. The stock pouches would have

been checked by the stock centre.

14.Ms Helen Rose was a work colleague within the Security Team and

performed whatever role was necessary within the team.

15.Ms Rose always behaved in a competent, professional and impeccable

manner at all times.

Page 5 of 31
WITNO04450100
WITN04450100

16. | am not aware of any involvement Ms Rose may have had.

17. | do not recall seeing or reading document FUJ00086811.

Second Sight

18.1 do not recall being involved with Second Sight.

19.1 have been asked if | am aware that allegations were made about my

conduct to Second Sight.

a.

| was not previously aware of any allegations made about my conduct.
I have now read document POL00099689 and | can categorically state
that | have never said to any person | have interviewed and definitely
not to Jacqueline McDonald that she was the only one in that position.
| refute the allegation that | am a liar, | do not know who she was

friends with or if they were involved with the JFSA.

| also refute the claim that Jacqueline McDonald was bullied, from the
moment we arrived, the auditor was already on site, conversations
were initially with Mr McDonald, the reason for our attendance was
explained, Mr and Mrs McDonald were kept updated as the day

progressed.

Ms Katie Noblet was not bullied and was spoken to as part of the
investigation to establish the facts of the discrepancy in the accounts. |
am not sure what Jacqueline McDonald means that she (Katie Noblet)
was running the Post Office under somebody's name and was bullied
about wage deductions or jail time. Post Office Ltd could not deduct

any monies from Katie Noblet wages as she was either paid by her

Page 6 of 31
WITNO04450100
WITN04450100

employer (Jaqueline McDonald) or her new employer the person she

was allegedly running the Post Office for on their behalf.

d. Ms Katie Noblet was not being bullied but was being asked if she
would provide a statement as part of the on-going investigation. Ms
Richards would be seeing how she was coping in running the Post

Office branch when Mr McDonald asked us to leave the shop.

e. Ms Jacqueline McDonald is also incorrect in stating Post Office
Investigators behaved like Mafia Gangsters looking to collect their

bounty with the threats and lies.

f. | would be grateful if | could have a copy from Jacqueline McDonald of

her notes of when these threats and lies were made to her.

g. Ms McDonald made no mention or made any allegation or comments
against myself or my colleagues regarding our behaviour, either during
the investigation, at the interview stage (although she did bring a friend
who was present throughout the interview) or in court by her barrister
or solicitor to either the trial judge or the prosecution barrister. | am
also not aware of any complaint being received by POL from Ms

McDonald.

Investigator on this enquiry. The Lead Investigator would ask the questions
but if appropriate on occasions the second officer would also ask questions.
At the end of the interview as the second officer | would normally oversee the
signing of the tape seals and the sealing of the master copy. Any forms that
need completing including NPA1 (Non-Police Agencies) a Notification of
Proceedings to Police and Antecedents. The Lead Investigator would submit

the file.

. There were no concerns, the investigation was conducted in a professional

manner at all times.
| do not have any other reflections about this matter.

| have looked at INQ00001035 at p25 (internal pages 97 and 98) and | can
categorically state that | have never said to any person | have interviewed
and definitely not to Janet Skinner “we have dealt with people who have
stolen from Post Offices before and like you, we know you haven't done
anything’. | did not have the jurisdiction to say anything like this nor would |
ever make this type of comments to anybody. At the end of an interview the
person would be informed of the next stages, i.e. a report would be done, and
the file sent off for advice and any decision would be made by the Legal

Department.

30. | have been asked about the appropriateness of “placing the burden” on the
defendant to “fully particularise” any problems with Horizon before further

on the Defendant as this enquiry concerned discrepancies due to the amount

of stock that should be on hand compared to the actual amount on hand.

3

.| have been asked about the appropriateness of the statement that POL “had
absolute confidence in the robustness and integrity of its Horizon system and
its branch accounting processes” (POL00059686). As far as | can recall this

at this time the contents in the statement were considered appropriate. All
