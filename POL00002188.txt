Dear Sir/Madam
Re Branch Discrepancies

You may have been aware of 2 small value unexplained discrepancies
that have impacted your branch.

I can confirm that gains of £3.34 declared at TP9 in 2011 and 2012 were
not proper to your branch. This problem was created by a specific set of

circumstances dating back to an actual loss you made good in 2010
(TP8).

In brief, the stock unit that deelared-the-diserepaney-and-placed-it
+ntecleared the TP8 loss from Local Suspense was deleted on or before
10" December 2010. The related Local Suspense entry should also have
been removed, but this did not happen.

The impact of this was that the fess-efclearance from 2010 was picked up
again at the beginning of TP9 the next year in Horizon, and treated as a
gain. At the end of TP9 the branch was forced to clear this along with
current discrepancies. The Local Suspense ledger in the Post Office
Finance System was impacted in the same way.

This was-scenario was then repeated at the same point the next year.

Both TP9 discrepancies recorded at your branch were made good. Post
Office Ltd will not be looking to recover these gains.

You may not have been aware of these discrepancies but I felt it to be
important to make you aware of the problem.

Changes to Horizon in 2011 prevented this problem for stock units
deleted after mid-December 2010, and the old Local Suspense entry has
now been removed from the system.

I do apologise for this problem being allowed to occur and impacting
your branch.

Yours sincerely
