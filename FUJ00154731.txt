Subject: Marine Drive CA - clarification

Gareth,

The Opening figures I used are actually the Office opening figures, but they are identical to the stock unit opening
figures. There was nothing in the suspense account.

I've rechecked the CAMappings and still can't see how the rems get included in the table 5 figures - the additional levels
of mappings just show how they build into the receipts hierarchy (for RIAD) or payments (for ROAD).

Anne
