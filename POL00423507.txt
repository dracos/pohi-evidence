SECTION I @

The purpose of this guide

This guide has been written to help bring to life the support that is available from Post Office for postmasters. It is not intended
to be a guide to everything that is available to you as a postmaster, but is intended to help signpost key support routes. Nothing in
this guide alters any of the terms of the contracts between Post Office and postmasters or introduces any new operational
procedures, it is simply a guide to the available support.

Why has this guide been created?

Post Office has changed and continues to change. The support Post Office offers postmasters has been significantly increased both
in the network and in the support centres. This guide shares what that support looks like so every postmaster can access
support when they need it and to ensure postmasterss are aware of the most up-to-date support available to them.

We also recognise that sometimes things go wrong, and when they do we will work with the postmaster to resolve things as
quickly as possible through the support processes we have in place. We know Post Office hasn't always got things right and we
hope this guide gives you confidence that Post Office has changed, with postmasters at the heart of everything we do.

SECTION 2

‘The relationship

Postmasters are at the heart of the Post Office.

You hold a unique position at the heart of the community you serve. A position of trust. A position of respect.

You have chosen to invest in the Post Office brand and in your local community.

With all this, there is an obligation to the thousands of customers who use our branches to ensure that we are providing the highest quality
service and standards. It is advantageous for both Post Office and postmasters to work together to achieve this, and Post Office is committed to

supporting you as a postmaster and resetting the relationship with any postmaster where we have got things wrong in the past.

The contracts between Post Office and postmasters require both parties to act in good faith. Post Office will behave fairly and professionally
when working with postmasters, and as a postmaster we know you will do the same in return,

This guide has been written to support the relationship between Post Office and postmasters, outlining the expectations of both parties to
ensure we collectively deliver for the customers and communities we serve.

If you don't think we are getting it right or don't think a member of the Post Office team is behaving in the right way, we want to know. In the
first instance you should contact your Area Manager or Regional Manager, but you can also approach any member of the Post Office management
team who will take any complaint you have seriously.

MANAGING CASH AND STOCK

Getting cash and stock levels just right is an important part of running a Post Office branch. Keeping too much cash and stock is not only a security risk to you, your
staff and customers, but it could also mean there is not enough cash and stock for other branches. Too little cash or stock and you may not have enough for
customers. There are also major productivity benefits in managing the levels of cash, stock and currency at the correct levels in that less cash, stock and currency
makes it easier for you to count.

Accurate transactions

Getting the basics right and ensuring that customer transactions are processed accurately helps reduce potential mistakes in branch, makes sure the customer gets the
service they want and limits ary financial losses to you.

‘Some top tips:
Please check the amount on screen after you enter the customer's transaction and make sure the Horizon online basket is empty before serving the next customer.

‘When completing chip and pin transactions, please make sure the correct withdrawal or deposit icon is pressed.
Remember to double-check the physical cash or stock that's being transferred to or from the customer.

Its important that any staff serving at the counter are concentrating on the transaction in hand and distractions such as mobile phones aren't used whilst serving As
‘well as making sure customer transactions are dealt with accurately it also helps protect against sleight of hand incidents.

‘We ask that as far as possible you undertake your own investigations in branch and we can provide support for you to do this. Help and support can also be

‘We have a four-tier investigation process to investigate issues and reach resolutions with postmasters to disputes. Not all investigations will require all four tiers of the
investigation process and the vast majority of issues requiring investigation are resolved very quickly and simply.

Tier I investigations are simple investigations that are usually resolved quickly. These investigations include calls into theTier I team at the Branch Support Centre
about balancing, desktop investigations undertaken by the branch monitoring team and some Transaction Correction and settlement disputes.

Tier 2 investigations are more skilled investigations. A Tier 2 investigation would be triggered because the matter could not be resolved in Tier I. These investigations
include calls into the Branch Support Centre that are escalated to the Tier 2 team, more complex Transaction Correction or settlement disputes, and branch audits.

Tier 3 investigations are specialist investigations. A Tier 3 investigation is triggered because the matter could not be resolved in Tier 2. These investigations include
security investigations (such as after a robbery or burglary) and investigations undertaken by the Contract Investigations and Resolution Team (CIRT).Very few
investigations reach Tier 3.

Tier 4 investigations are the most complex investigations we carry out and are completed by the Case Review Team. ATier 4 investigation is triggered either because
‘a matter could not be resolved at Tier 3 or because the matter is historical and complex. tis exceptional for an investigation to reach Tier 4.
