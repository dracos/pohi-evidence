You're right to raise this and I'll get someone to look into it and explain to me what happened. I'll get back to you in a day
or two depending on whether this is complex or simple.

Hi Dave

Please can you see the scanned correspondence sent on behalf of the subpostmaster at Pipeland Road Post Office regarding
issues around the recovery process following the Horizon outage on Monday 9th.

You will see that the receipt that was ultimately recovered by approaching the customer afier the event show that £126.96
was paid to the customer, but the recovery receipt shows a 0 balance and that the 'recovery failed’. I cannot understand why
the first call to the helpline indicated that all would be sorted out but the advice on the follow up call a day later indicated
that as the customer had left the counter with the receipt then the subpostmaster would be liable. You will appreciate that
this would suggest that the subpostmaster should prevent the customer leaving the office until Horizon is back up and the
recovery process complete!!

I would be interested to hear your comments and clarification of the position and the helpline script.

Regards
Marilyn
