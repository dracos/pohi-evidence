Dated: 30 August 2023

POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF JOHN GRAEME SIMPKINS

|, MR JOHN GRAEME SIMPKINS, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. As noted in my first witness statement dated 4 August 2022, | am currently
employed by Fujitsu Services Limited (‘Fujitsu’) as a Team Leader within the
Software Support Centre for the Horizon IT System (the “SSC”), a position |

have held since 2010.

2. This second witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT
Inquiry (the “Inquiry”) with the matters put to Fujitsu in Rule 9 Requests dated
16 June 2023 and 31 July 2023 (the “First Request” and “Second Request’,
respectively, and together the “Requests”), to the extent | have or had direct
knowledge of such matters. Where | have referred to documents to assist my
preparation of responses to the Requests, the URNs of the relevant documents

are set out in this statement.

3. | was assisted in preparing this statement by Morrison Foerster, the recognised

legal representatives for Fujitsu in the Inquiry.

ARQ DATA

4. As part of the First Request, the Inquiry has provided Fujitsu with an ARQ
Spreadsheet for the Marine Drive branch Financial Accounts Division or “FAD”
Code 213337) showing certain transactions and events dating from 2February
2004 (the “ARQ Spreadsheet’, LCAS0001383 pages 17 and 18 only). | have
now been made aware that the ARQ Spreadsheet forms part of a larger
document. However, for the avoidance of doubt, in preparing this statement, |
understand that the Inquiry requires me to consider pages 17 and 18 of
LCAS0001383 only, and does not require me to consider the remaining pages

of the document.

5. By way of background for the Inquiry, the SSC does not use and has never
generally used ARQ data in the course of its investigations. Instead, for
example in the context of Legacy Horizon, the SSC referred to copies of the
original Riposte messagestore for the relevant branch when investigating and
diagnosing potential issues with the system. In this regard, the raw
messagestore contained information additional to that in the filtered ARQ
spreadsheets, and provided a much more comprehensive account of the data

held in the audit archive.

6. The messagestores used by the SSC were in an ascii format and consisted of
long strings of text, which the SSC could then search and filter as necessary.
Each string represented a Riposte Message in Riposte Attribute Grammar
(“RAG”) (as described further below) which is quite similar to the more modern
JSON format. These extracted files were derived from binary files held on the

correspondence servers or on the counters.

WITNO04110200
WITNO04110200

For security reasons, the SSC was (and continues to be) segregated from the
audit function. The SSC therefore has no direct access to, (i) the audit data held
in the data centres, (ii) the audit tools, or (iii) which files, logs, messagestore
information etc. are collected for audit. Neither has the SSC ever supported the
audit platform. It is for these reasons that | am not in a position to respond to
the Inquiry’s questions surrounding the reliability of the audit archive or of the

ARQ data provided to Post Office Limited (“POL”) over time.

That being said, the headings set out in the ARQ Spreadsheet were familiar to
me, as they appear to reflect sections of the messages recorded in the Riposte
messagestore (albeit altered slightly in some instances). The ARQ
Spreadsheet provided by the Inquiry appears to be in two parts, page 1 is a
filtered extract containing the EPOSS event messages from the messagestore,
and page 2 is a filtered list containing the transactions, also from the

messagestore.

The messagestore itself is made up of Riposte messages. The style of the
messages is called Riposte Attribute Grammar (also referred to as “RAG”). This
is essentially a list of attribute names and their values. For example, “<Id:1>” is
an attribute named “Id” with the value “1”. However, these attributes could be
nested, for example, <TxnData:<Sessionld:44-186311-1-5858-1>>. In this
instance, in order to refer to the Sessionid, you would use the notation

“TxnData.Sessionld”.

In relation to HNG-X, the nearest analogy to the Riposte messagestore is the

Branch database.

In the Second Request, the Inquiry has asked me to confirm whether, in my
view, the ARQ data provided to POL in respect of proceedings against
postmasters was sufficient to enable a postmaster to understand whether the
system was operating correctly. As noted above, | have not generally referred
to ARQ data as part of my role within the SSC and have no direct knowledge
of what data was provided to POL for proceedings against postmasters. Neither
do I have any understanding as to whether the ARQ Spreadsheet provided by

the Inquiry contains information typical of ARQ data provided to POL.

That being said, if | refer to the ARQ Spreadsheet by way of an example, my
view is that the data provided in the ARQ Spreadsheet does not contain
sufficient information for a postmaster to assess the health of the Horizon
system at their branch. The ARQ Spreadsheet shows only those transactions
recorded by the system. It shows that there were no receipts and payments
mismatch within those transactions and that there were no system failures that
required recovery. However, it does not demonstrate the health of the system

beyond those parameters.

The Inquiry has also asked whether the “sources” from which ARQ data was
obtained would have been sufficient for a postmaster to understand whether
the system was operating correctly. Due to my limited knowledge as to the files,
data and events that feed into the audit system, both at the time of the ARQ

Spreadsheet and to date, | am unable to comment.

Beyond the data described above, it would also have been useful for the
postmaster to have visibility of (i) the opening figures from the last rollover, (ii) a

running total of the sales, and (iii) the daily cash and stamp declarations made

Page 4 of 27
WITNO04110200
WITNO04110200

by the postmaster. Access to these records would have allowed the postmaster
to compare the Horizon generated figures against the declarations made by the
postmaster from the point of the last rollover. A comparison of these figures
would show the point at which the two figures diverged, allowing the postmaster

to then check what was happening at the branch at that point in time.

ARQ SPREADSHEET HEADINGS

15. The Inquiry has asked Fujitsu to explain the various headings in the ARQ
Spreadsheet, including a breakdown of the structure of the SessionID and
TxnID fields. Notwithstanding the limitations set out at paragraph 5 above, an
explanation of each of the headings of the ARQ Spreadsheet is set out below.
These explanations have been assisted in part by refrence to the document
entitled “TPS Object Model” and dated 19 August 1999 (“TD/DES/013’,
FUJ00171947). These explanations start first with page 2 of the ARQ

Spreadsheet (namely, the list of transactions).

16. Column A-“ID”: See TD/DES/013, section 3.3: Id, “Counter position number.

The numbers for these counter positions are as follows:

Value Meaning

1 Gateway Counter (i.e. the counter which communicates with the
datacentres on behalf of the branch)

2 to 30 The counter range of node IDs

31 The mirror messagestore. This is only used when a branch has
a single counter position. It acts as a Riposte neighbour to
create a duplicate copy of the messagestore on counter 1

Without this if the hard disk on counter 1 failed, any messages
that had not been replicated to the datacentre would have been
lost.

32-58 Correspondence servers in Bootle (even numbers, as below):

MWICOR14 - 59

Column B - User: See TD/DES/013, section 3.3: User, “Clerk/employee as

Riposte user’.

Column C — SU: See TD/DES/013, section 3.4: Container, “Stock unit name”.
By way of background, there are two types of stock unit, (i) individual, which is
attributable to a single user at any one time, and (ii) shared, where more than
one user can use the stock unit at the same time. The way in which stock units
in Legacy Horizon were configured was determined by each postmaster on a

branch-by-branch basis.

Column D - Date:

19.1 The explanation of this field could be drawn from several sources, as

noted below.

19.1.1 See TD/DES/013, section 3.3: Date, “The date the message is

written to the journal, format (DD-Mon-YYYY)”; or

Page 6 of 27
WITNO04110200
WITNO04110200

19.1.2 See TD/DES/013, section 3.4: Start Date, “Date the transaction
commenced’ (note that the attribute hierarchy, as explained at

paragraph 9 above, is TxnData.Start.Date); or

19.1.3 See TD/DES/013, section 3.4: End Date, “Date the transaction
completed” (note that the attribute hierarchy, as explained at

paragraph 9 above, is TxnData.End.Date).

19.2 Initially, | thought that this field would have been the first option in this list
(i.e. the “Date” field). However, due to the confusing timeline for the
transferred session (see SessionID 44-213337-1-899855-1), it now
appears that this field is probably the transaction “Start Date”. Given that
all the transactions provided in the ARQ Spreadsheet are for the same
date, the choice of “Date” field attribute should not affect the
interpretation of the ARQ Spreadsheet. It is, however, important for the
time element below. A member of the Fujitsu audit team should be able

to confirm the position.

20. Column E - Time:

20.1 As with the “Date” field above, the explanation of this field could be drawn

from several sources, as noted below.

20.1.1 See TD/DES/013, section 3.3: Time, “The time the message is
written to the journal, format (HH:MM:SS)”. Unless specified, |

believe that this was in UTC.

Page 7 of 27
WITNO04110200
WITNO04110200

20.1.2 See TD/DES/013, section 3.4: Start Time, “Time the transaction
commenced” (note the attribute hierarchy, as explained at

paragraph 9 above, is TxnData.Start. Time)

20.1.3 See TD/DES/013, section 3.4: End Time, “Time the transaction
completed’ (note the attribute hierarchy, as explained at

paragraph 9 above, is TxnData.Start. Time)

20.2 In line with the “Date” field above, it appears that the “Time” field in the
ARQ Spreadsheet is likely to be the transaction “Start Time”. This makes
most sense when looking at the ARQ Spreadsheet as, using the “Start
Time” field, the time allocated to the transactions would be the time they
were added to the basket, as opposed to the time they were settled and
committed to the messagestore (someone from Fujitsu's audit team
should be able to confirm the position). By way of explanation, “settled”
is a term used when the transactions in a basket are settled to a payment
type e.g. cash, card or cheque. This is normally the last thing to happen
when a basket is completed and journalised (i.e. recorded in the

messagestore).

20.3 The use of the “Start Time” field (if my interpretation is correct) means
that the transactions appear to jump back and forth between the
counters, when in fact | believe the user only moved once. This may
initially give the impression that there were concurrent logins by the user,
when in fact it appears that there was no concurrent login in this instance

(see further explanation below).

Column F - Sessionld: See TD/DES/013, section 3.4: Session Id, “Unique
session identifier for all transactions within a customer session. Contains
Groupld, Id and Num separated by hyphens of the messages (normally the first)

within the session”

21.1 By way of background, a session is generated by Riposte when a new
basket is opened and closes when the basket is settled. Canceled

sessions would not generally appear in the messagestore.

21.2 In order to assist the Inquiry, set out on the next page is an example
session from the ARQ spreadsheet. An explanation of the example is

then provided on the following page.

21.3 Using Session “44-213337-1-899855-1" as an example, this has 15
transactions in the session; 14 transactions that are coming into the
branch, these were all product 184 (Grp13 Retirement Pension), and one
transaction is going out of the branch. This was the settlement to product
1 (Cash). All these transactions can be seen to belong to the same
session, as they all have the same sessionnumber. The session can be
seen to total to zero value as expected. Further detail in relation to the

Product field is provided below.

21.4 In this example, the session number is created by:

21.4.1 44: | believe this stands for the UK.

21.4.2 213337: The numeric version of the FAD (Financial Accounts

Division) code (excluding the check digit).

21.4.3 1: The counter position (“Id”) that the session was created on.

21.4.4 899855: A current messagestore “Num” to ensure that the
Session number is unique. This appears to be the “Num” of when
the previous Session completed, but that is just from
observation. By way of background, “Num” is a consecutive

number to ensure that each message is uniquely identifiable.

21.4.5 1: 1am unsure what this is generated by. The value for this field
is usually one but may be more. However, once generated the

value stays the same for the Session.

WITNO04110200

Column G - Txnld: From TD/DES/013 section 3.4: Txn Id, “Unique transaction
identifier for all messages within a customer transaction. Contains Groupld, Id
and Num separated by hyphens of the messages (normally the first) within the

transaction’.

22.1 Using the same example above, the first transaction has a Txnld of “44-
213337-1-899855-2”. This is very similar to the Sessionld. The

construction is:

22.1.1 44: | believe this stands for the UK.

22.1.2 213337: As above, this is the numeric version of the FAD code

(excluding the check digit).

22.1.3 1: The counter position (“Id”) where the transaction was added

to the basket.

22.1.4 899855: This is normally the same as the Sessionld (but not

always, as can be seen by the settlement transaction).

22.1.5 2: This usually starts at 1 and increases by increments of 1 for
each transaction added to the Session. There may be gaps in
the numbering (as in this case), for example, where transactions
are added and removed. There may also be duplicates where
products are linked (see for example TxnIld 44213337-1-
899920-3 which was for Products 260 “Transcash Giro” and 121

“Giro Transcash Fee’).

reference data provided by POL. The long names for these products are below.
| understand from Morrison Foerster and the legal team at Fujitsu that the

Column J - Qty: See TD/DES/013, section 3.4: Qty, “Quantity of product

standard practice for trading, stock held at the branch was treated as a liability

and was therefore reflected as a negative value. To that extent, stock being

sold by the branch appears in the messagestore as a positive value and stock

Column K — SaleValue: See TD/DES/013, section 3.4: Sale Value, “Actual

sale value, may be negative, or zero in the case of milk tokens’.

Column L - EntryMethod: See TD/DES/013, section 3.4: Entry Method,
“Method of data capture’. The meanings of the values for this attribute are set
out in the table below. As is clear from the table, this attribute was not completed

for every type of transaction.

of which was the customer's national insurance number, followed by details of

the relevant book and benefits for payment.

Column O - Result: See TD/DES/013, section 3.7: Result, “/t]he result of the

OBCS transaction”. The meanings of the values for this attribute are set out

below:
Value Meaning
1 OK
2 Impound
3 Unreadable
4 Invalid

Column P - Foreignindicator: Foreign encashment related to the payment of

benefits, particularly child benefits. In this regard, each benefits claimant had a

“nominated” branch, which was the default branch where they would go to

collect their benefit payments. If a benefits claimant attended a different branch

to collect a payment, the system would go online to look up the relevant details.

This was classified as a “foreign” encashment and took slightly longer than a

payment at the claimant’s nominated branch.

31.1 TD/DES/013 does not discuss this message attribute directly but does

discuss its usage in the Oracle database (section 4.12 and 4.13) as the

database field “not foreign’. This has somewhat reversed the logic, but

my understanding would be that this attribute value in the messagestore

and any derived ARQ data would be “0” when the transaction is at the

nominated branch and “1” when it is a foreign encashment.

31.2 For completeness, the messagestore field this is derived from is:

EPOSSTransaction.BlackBoxData.ForeignIndicator.

Page 16 of 27
WITNO04110200
WITNO04110200

32. In relation to the additional attributes in the event log page of the ARQ

Spreadsheet:

32.1 EPOSSTransaction.Ti is a high-level descriptor of the event (e.g. that a

report was printed); and

32.2 EPOSSTransaction.T provides further details of the event (e.g. the type

of report that was printed).

SIMULTANEOUS LOG-INS

33. The Inquiry has asked Fujitsu to explain, both in the context of Legacy Horizon
and HNG-X, whether it is possible for a postmaster to be logged on to more
than one node (or “counter”) simultaneously, using the same User ID. The
Inquiry has asked for the ARQ Spreadsheet to be used as an example in this

regard.

34. Although there have been various issues with concurrent logins over time
(some of which are discussed in this statement), an initial observation is that
the ARQ Spreadsheet for this particular instance does not appear to contain
evidence that a user was logged onto two counters simultaneously. Instead, the
data contained in this ARQ Spreadsheet appears to show that the user made
use of the “Session Transfer” and “Suspend Session” functions that were
available in Legacy Horizon (as explained in more detail below). In order to
determine more conclusively what happened at the branch, access to the raw

messagestore would be required.

35. However, in response to the Inquiry’s First Request, | set out below my

understanding of simultaneous logins in both Legacy Horizon and HNG-X.

Legacy Horizon:

The “Session Transfer” facility allowed the current user session to be
transferred from one counter to a second counter. For example, if whilst logged
into Counter 1, the same user logs into Counter 2, the application would send
all transactional information for current active and/or suspended sessions from
Counter 1 to Counter 2 and then log the user out of the original counter (the
document entitled ‘EPOSS Transaction Service - High Level Design’
(EP/DES/022) dated 27 July 2000 (FUJ00171948), may be of interest to the
Inquiry in this regard). This is the facility that appears to have been used by the
user in this ARQ Spreadsheet, as illustrated in my analysis of the transactions

in Appendix 1 to this statement.

Early in the life of Legacy Horizon (pre-rollout), a user could have a concurrent
login by performing a Session Transfer whilst the originating counter was very
busy, for example generating a large report. However, from PinICL PC0011992
raised on 12 June 1998 (FUJ00112120), | can see that the “StopDeskTransfer”
module was introduced in around January 1999 as a mor robust way of
notifying the system when not to transfer a session. The StopDeskTransfer
service is described in more detail in section 2.4 of the document entitled‘High
Level Design of Common Agents (AD/DES/042) and dated 27 May 2003
(FUJ00171949). However, Peak PC0065075 raised on 18 April 2001
(FUJ00171950) indicates that providers of the Riposte software, Escher, fixed
the issues that the StopDeskTransfer module was intended to address and,

from April 2001, the module was no longer required.

That being said, if the counters were not communicating with one another inside
the branch (not to be confused with communication to the data centre), then
there was still the potential for a user to be logged on to two counters. This is
expressed in PinICL PC0061801 raised on 30 January 2001 (FUJ00171951)
which notes that “[hJaving looked at the problem it seems that, due to excess
network activity, the two counters were not in communication with each other
and were therefore seemingly disconnected. In this circumstance, the desktop

will time out and allow the login so that users can log in after a counter crash.”

Although | do not recall being aware at the relevant time, during the course of
the Bates & Ors v POL Group Litigation (the “Group Litigation”), | became
aware of defects in the system that allowed concurrent logon. This work

identified the following two Peaks:

39.1 PC0027581 (raised on 9 July 1999, FUJ00075563): This Peak showed
that a user could logon to two counters simultaneously, but this was not
regarded as a defect by Esher. In fact, it had been discussed before in
PinlCL PC0013495 (FUJ00109810), where it was viewed as a breach of
the Access Control Policy, as to log into more than one counter

simultaneously would require the user to share their logon details.

39.2 PC0051327 (raised on 28 July 2000, FUJ00072297): A session transfer
occurred whilst the user was rolling the stock unit. The transfer failed but
the user was still logged on to the second counter. This was during the
introduction of the StopDeskTransfer and the EPOSS code was not yet
using the newer functionality. This was fixed when the next version of

EPOSS was released that used the StopDeskTransfer functionality.

HNG-X:

Initially, concurrent log ins were not possible in HNG-X. The user would get a
warning about a concurrent logon noting that, if they continued the original
session, they would be disconnected. However, that changed with the

introduction of EUM, part of “Enhanced User Management”.

Now, following the introduction of EUM, there is one internal Post Office ID
(‘POID”) for each user across the entire estate. Each user is then able to have
multiple Horizon User IDs (“HUID”). These HUIDs allow the user to work on
multiple counters in the same branch at any one time. That being said, ifa user
does log into a second counter, the first counterwould have to be locked whilst
the session on the second counter is taking place. The user can then return to

the first counter to complete their original session.

| refer in this regard to the document entitled ‘HNG-X Counter Application High
Level Design’ (DES/APP/HLD/0047) and dated 8 June 2023 (FUJ00171952),
which states at 7.15 (Lock Counter), “faJs part of changes for CP2144 (EUM
Concurrent Login), the existing ‘Lock’ button is separated from
Suspend/Resume button and included as new Button (shortcut— T3) on the
right hand command bar. CP2144 provides the ability to logon to multiple
Counters with a single POID and one or more HUIDs. The major restriction on
this concurrent logon ability is that only one Counter may be active at any one

point in time while the other Counters must be locked...”

TIMESTAMPS IN THE AUDIT DATA
43. The Inquiry has asked Fujitsu to explain, both in the context of Legacy Horizon
and HNG-X, how timestamps are recorded and synchronised. These are

addressed in turn below:

Legacy Horizon:

44. The timestamps recorded in Legacy Horizon were from the local counter time.
However, there was a time service (“NTP”) running at the correspondence
layer, and the counters would synchronise their local time to these servers via
the Riposte Service. A Windows event would be generated when this
happened. | exhibit Peaks PC0070702 (raised on 15 October 2001,
FUJ00171953) and PC0074043 (raised on 20 February 2002, FUJ00171954)

to this statement in this regard.

45. From PC0053384 raised on 1 September 2000 (FUJ00075159), it appears that
the initial rollout of Legacy Horizon allowed a maximum of one second drift
before a Windows event was generated, which was increased to five seconds
due to an issue with ISDN delay. This Peak also mentions that this change
would be captured in version 0.5 of the document entitled ‘Riposte 6 Message
Server Configuration for Counters’ (TD/SPE/010) which is dated 8 August 2000
(FUJ00171955). | do not believe there to have been any real practical impact
from this change. It just meant that there were no continuous time corrections

happening anymore.

HNG-X:

46. There are multiple date / time elements in the transaction tables in the Branch

Database, some of these elements are completed by the counter, some are

Page 21 of 27
WITNO04110200
WITNO04110200

completed by the BAL and others are completed by the Branch Database. |
defer to the subject matter experts in this regard, most likely to be Architects

with specialist knowledge.

47. In relation to this aspect of the Inquiry’s First Request, | note that Fujitsu no
longer controls the counter hardware or operation including the NTP service,

which are now managed by DXC.

OFFLINE TRANSACTIONS

48. The Inquiry has asked, both in the context of Legacy Horizon and HNG-X, what
the expected reporting would be in the “log files” when transactions have taken
place offline (i.e., when the counter is not connected to the datacentre). For
Legacy Horizon, | have interpreted the term “log files” to mean the Riposte
messagestore discussed above. Although network connectivity issues do not
generally fall within the remit of the SSC, | set out below my understanding of
the position based on knowledge | have gained during my time on the Post

Office Account at Fujitsu.

Legacy Horizon:

49. Legacy Horizon was designed to function predominantly offline. Transactions
conducted offline in Legacy Horizon would therefore appear exactly the same
as those conducted online. Any transactions that had online requirements

would fail if a user attempted to conduct them offline.

50. In terms of the user’s view when conducting transactions offline, | understand
that, after the introduction of Network Banking, a banner appeared on the
bottom of the screen when a counter was offline and any buttons to online-

related services were disabled.

Page 22 of 27
WITNO04110200
WITNO04110200

51. In relation to network connectivity issues, the Counter Network Infrastructure
Manager (“CNIM”) would send frequent pings from the gateway counter to the
datacentre. See the document entitled ‘CNIM Low Level Design’ (RS/LLD/004)
and dated 8 May 2006 (FUJ00171956). CNIM would manage fai-over between
the different network methods available to the branch and also record quality of
service logs that were then sent from CNIM to the Tivoli SYSMAN daabase so

that the Tivoli team could see which branches had poor connection

52. A network management suite also pinged the branches from the datacentre
frequently so that it was quickly apparent if a large number of branches were
offline / disconnected from the network. As noted above, network issues did not
generally fall within the remit of the SSC, but the SSC could retrieve quality of

service logs if necessary for our diagnostic activities.

HNG-X:

53. | HNG-X does not function offline. If the counter were to disconnect, it would
probably do a forced logout which would abandon anything in the basket which

was not recoverable and print a disconnection report.

54. If a transaction is attempted offline in HNG-X, there would be a record in the
application logs on the counter. There would also be Windows events for any

network issues.

INTERPRETING THE ARQ SPREADSHEET

55. The timeline in the ARQ Spreadsheet may appear confusing and out of order
because, as user LCA001 transfers between counter positions (IDs) 1 and 2,
they also suspend a Session before settling it. If the Riposte “Num” attribute

was provided in the ARQ Spreadsheet, that would provide further detail in

Page 23 of 27
56.

57.

relation to the actual order of the activities. As noted in section 3.3 of
TD/DES/013, “Num” is the Riposte message number. This is a consecutively
incrementing number that is allocated by Riposte to a message as it is written

to the messagestore. This would be more than just transactions.

Although the only way to be completely confident of the reason behind the order
of the transactions in the ARQ Spreadsheet would be to analyse the underlying
messagestore, | believe the most likely explanation regarding the timing of the

various transactions up to 14:34:20 is set out in Appendix 1 to this statement.

In summary, the confusion seems to relate to the “Time” field provided in the
ARQ Spreadsheet. As noted above, it seems that this field contains the
transaction Start Time, as opposed to the Riposte Message Time therefore the
ordering by this time does not provide the sequence of when actions completed
but rather when they were started. This is an important distinction, as there may
be a long gap between the transaction being added to the basket and the

transaction being settled and written to the messagestore.

Statement of Truth

| believe the content of this statement to be true.
