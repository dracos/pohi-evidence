AG Anthony Frank Gardner.

SB Can you just repeat your name Lisa please.

LB Lisa Brennan.

so Steve Owens.

SB OK. The break was taken because the previous tape was running out. I
have to remind you of your legal rights. Can you just time and date the
top for me. You're still under caution which is you do not have to say
anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when
questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do
say may be given in evidence. Now the first bit that you, can you just sign
there to say that you’ve been re-cautioned. Sorry sign the top line.

LB Top line.

wish to speak to a solicitor at this time you can change your mind at any
time during the interview, do you understand?

LB Yeh.

SB OK Lisa, just as the other tape was coming to an end we were talking
about the pension and allowance discrepancies that have been found using
these date stamps. You were telling us that you’ve had a few problems at
home and that. While I understand that you’ve been working under
pressure, you gave us an explanation then and you tell us you work quite
quickly, is there any reason why all these discrepancies are only appearing
in pension and allowances when none of your other work ..?..

LB No, I’ve got no explanation.

SB It amounts to close to £1000 in a few weeks, it’s getting a little bit more
than just being careless.

LB Yeh, it is.

SB Your balances haven’t reflected.

LB No.

SB Nobody’s come back to you.

LB No.

SB I don’t know how much we believe that everybody’s completely dishonest
when you’ve overpaid them. You haven’t double keyed a number
because the numbers are different on the front on some examples.

LB Yeh. Ihaven’t got it, that’s all Ican say. I haven’t got it.

SB There’s got to be a reason for it, you can’t just lose £1000...

LB What if I’m serving them and say I pay off the docket and I’m giving it
somewhere else short in the day and not knowing or .. I know I’m like
clutching at straws here.

So you’re making 2 mistakes you’re saying.

Several, I don’t know. I really don’t know.

They’re all mistakes all centred around the pensions, you’re not making
mistakes anywhere else. I mean it’s not... you’re duty’s not just about
paying out pension and allowances. You’ve got a number of transactions
to perform but all your mistakes ..and they’re very convenient, £100 or
£200 with a different number in the pensions.

I don’t know what to say, I haven’t got it, I haven’t got it. I don’t want to
lose my job if I’m crap or even if you think I’m robbing. I don’t want to
lose my job.

Is there any reason why the Post Office should continue to employ you,
giving £1000 away in a few short weeks.

I don’t want to lose my job. I love my job. I thought I was good at my
job.

We’ll be making further checks, what if we find even more. When do we
draw the line between it being careless and deliberate?

I don’t know.

See this started simply because someone in Chesterfield decided to ask for
the dockets for Heighton to be checked for week 41. 18,000 post offices,
we can’t check every pension claim for every office every week so there’s
a certain percentage checked and Heighton came out of the hat for week
41 and these discrepancies were found, not major discrepancies, there’s
£139.70, there’s things like 20p disallowed which means something has
been overclaimed by 20p, there’s another one £20 disallowed, I mean
that’s virtually nothing. 50p allowed so someone has made a mistake the

wrong way there, they’ve not paid out £15.50, or they’ve paid out £15.50

and claimed it as £15 so that’s 50p allowed. Then we’ve got another £20
disallowed but then we’ve got one order valued £179.05 has been claimed
but it’s not there, it’s missing completely.

05.30 LB And that’s me?

AG No. And there’s another one, group 14, there’s 3 at £79.05 claimed and
there’s 4 received. Now, that’s probably because what they’ve done there
is they’ve worded it the other way round. What they’ve said is there’s a
docket for £79.05 that hasn’t been claimed but it’s a docket for £179.05
which is isn’t there which has been claimed so in effect that probably is
you if we have a look at that one. So to carry on from that, week 41 found
these errors so a further 4 weeks were checked and the same sort of errors
every week.

LB Yeh.

AG So then we’ve had a look at the pouch each week when it’s left here and
there’s a lot to go through and we’ve found further mistakes so we
haven’t asked for Lisahally to make any further checks in between yet
because the matter’s quite serious, we’re losing £100, £200, £300 a week,
if I just check that one in fact, because we have the listings here. Right,
we’ ve got week 41 which is there, that’s 42. And they’re talking about a
group 14. It’s that one there isn’t it? Yeh. I’m just going to show you
that one, Steve’s gonna give that an initial as well and a number.

SB SB9. Again, datestamped as B. 4 at £79.05 claimed and the one that’s
.-2.. one at £179.05 claimed but not there.

AG There you go, that’s £100, exactly the same as the others. So if we just
look at these, the £100 there plus another £100 is £200 plus that one is
£300, 4, 5, 6, 7, that’s £700 in 5 weeks. Now if you have a look at that on

an annual basis, £700, it’s about £7,000. That’s more than you get paid.
We can’t afford to keep you can we?

LB Don’t sack me.

AG I’m not going to sack you but Jan Mullen is going to get a report and she’s

LB Well give me a refresher course or something, don’t sack me.

AG You don’t need a refresher course do you? To be honest with you I think
you’ve stolen it.

LB Thaven’t stolen it.

AG There’s no other explanation.

LB I haven’t got it.

AG There’s no other explanation is there Lisa.

LB If it looks that way. I know that’s what you think.

AG Week after week after week there’s exactly the same mistakes, we’re now
going to go away and ask Lisahally to check the whole year, which is
gonna take them some time isn’t it because this office pays out £400,000
a week. It’s gonna take a while to check all the dockets isn’t it? Well
eventually they will come back with a list of al the mistakes that have
been made at this office and I’ll guarantee there’s £100, £200, £300 a
week, week after week after week. Now what would you say if we came
back and said that, you know, we’re talking about £6000, £7000. No
amount of refresher course is going to teach you how to slow down and
press the right buttons. You’re doing it on all the other transactions.
Your giros, your giro impayments, your out payments, green giros,
telephone bills. You said you balanced almost to the penny.

LB I didn’t say that.

AG How much were they, a couple of quid out. All right, a couple fo quid
then, sorry, it wasn’t almost to the penny, a couple of quid. I think a
couple of quid’s quite good.

10.00 LB You'll never be ..?..

AG No, on paper you’ve balanced to within a couple of quid.

LB Yeh.

AG But then we have a look at the mistakes that are being made in the
pensions and that’s the only place where we found mistakes ‘cos that’s
what the auditor’s just done, is just check your stock. The only major
discrepancies he’s found is the ones in the pensions. Why do you think
we're here. Because we’ve got the same pattern week after week after
week.

LB I wouldn’t do that, I’m not that bloody soft.

AG I’ve heard that a few times before as well.

SB But it hasn’t happened every day.

LB Yeh.

SB So if you worked 4 days, so if you’re to be believed that you’re telling us
because of the way you work and you’re working quickly we would have
at least 4 occasions each week if you’re working the same way each day.

AG You'd be making mistakes on your pensions all the while wouldn’t you.
You'd be £100 over or £100 short, £50 over because you’re working so
quickly the keyboard is so .. I don’t know, so difficult to operate when
you’re paying a pension out. Not you then. You’ve not stolen any
money?

LB Thaven’t got it, no.

AG OK.

SB .?.. go away and make more checks. ..?.. get everything sorted out.

LB Thave not got it.

SB Do you think somebody else has got it then?

LB I dunno.

AG How can anyone else get it, they can’t key in figures can they?

LB No, no one else can take it out of my stock can they?

AG No one else uses your code do they?

LB No.

AG You say yourself that you stay with the same stock.

LB Yeh.

AG So you don’t leave the stock and say will you serve out of this one and I'll
go and have a cup of tea.

LB No, not like that, no.

AG So nobody else can be blamed for it, whether it’s genuine or whether it’s
deliberate, it’s you isn’t it?

LB Yeh. What can I say?

AG You said you didn’t do it. So we have to go away and write a report and
see what other people think. We don’t have any control over it, all we do
is present the evidence that we’ve got. There’s the evidence, we go away
and do a few more checks and we add that to the evidence that we’ve
already got and then someone makes a decision about you.

LB I love my job, I love doing this.

AG Well if I was pinching £200 or £300 a week I'd love it as well. Some
subsidy to your income that isn’t it, £200 a week plus £200 or £300 out of
the drawer.

LB It would be wouldn’t it. I haven’t got it.

LB Sorry.

AG Which bank accounts have you got?

LB My girobank.

AG Would you give us permission to have a look at that, have a look at the
girobank account?

LB Why?

AG Well, you might have it in the giro.

LB A statement there if you want a look at that.

AG When’s the statement dated?

LB I got it out the machine the other day.

AG Have you got your bag with you? If you’d like to show us that we’d be
obliged. OK. This shows a balance of £582. There’s been 17
transactions since the last statement and the last time they’re shown.
What did you get paid on the 31‘* May?

LB We got the big bonus.

AG bonus.

LB Five hundred and odd quid I think it was.

AG So you take that £533 out which is a bonus which you wouldn’t normally
get that, would leave you a balance of less than £100 so I think that we
can safely say that if any money’s been ..?.. away it’s not been put in the
