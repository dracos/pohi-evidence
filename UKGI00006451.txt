Great thanks.

Tim expecting first draft of report in the next week or so. Should be finalised by end of the month but no idea what it
will say.

Thanks, no worries on the exit pay stuff, I have plenty to be occupying myself with! Do send it on over when ready.

On Sparrow, appreciate this is arm’s length, but if there is any intel on timing or likely outcomes, that would be very
helpful to have. We can touch base closer to the time once the Tim/BNR meeting is in the diary.

Message received and understood!

BTW —I realise I meant to send you a message re the redundancy cap but failed to do so, for which please accept my
apologies. I had too many questions on the draft briefing to send it to you in good faith. Hope to resolve those this

week

From my point of view, BNR will definitely expect Tim to be prepared to talk about Sparrow. So its important to find a
date that will allow that to happen - if that means going later ie Feb then that's what Di needs to offer.

Thanks Richard
That’s helpful. And yes let’s touch base beforehand.

I'd be surprised if we did not have a clear view on Sparrow by then but it’s not my commitment to make I’m afraid (as
you know, my view is very clear!). I will feed in your steer though.

It was always the plan to have him come in to talk to BNR once he had done his Sparrow review (although also a
general chat having been in post for a few months). She will no doubt raise the provision issue too, but lets touch
base nearer the time. If you think its better to do it slightly later to allow more time for the review to complete its
better to know (although I would have thought a clear view would have emerged by then?).

Hi Richard

Hope you had a good Christmas and New Year.

Re: the message below, I know that Mark suggested this sort of timing when he met Paula just before Christmas,
following Al’s briefings. Are you aware of any particular reason or other issue that has led to this request? Grateful

for any detail that you can offer.

For completeness, I am hoping that his review of Sparrow will be complete to this timescale too but it is being done at
arm’s length so I cannot be sure,

Thanks

Tom

Hi Diane,

Baroness Neville-Rolfe would like to meet with Tim Parker in later January or early February to discuss a number of
issues related to the Post Office.

Please can you send through some dates and times that might work for Tim and we can take things forward from
there.

Kind regards
