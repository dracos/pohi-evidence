MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

GENERAL

Programme Status Live Outlets Operational Counters
I zi January2000 I 2000 4485
Comments
As National Rollout re-commenced in January, there were 2000 Outlets in Live operation by the end of the month. However, despite
the increased number of Outlets, there was a reduction in the total number of calls logged with the HSH (7017 calls in Jan 2000 as
compared with 7556 calls in Dec 1999). This in turn caused the ratio of calls per Outlet to drop to 3.5 in January, compared with 4.
in December 1999.

The Advice and Guidance category saw a significant drop in call volumes in January, whereas the volume of Software calls logged had
increased when compared with December's figure. The increase in Software call volumes was attributable to the following problems:

BT bills - invalid token
On 27th January a large number of incidents were raised because BT Bills could not be scanned. This was the result of a Reference
Data Process fail and a subsequent over-run during the previous night.

This particular problem was resolved by advising counters of a work around and transmitting the missing Reference data later that
day.

Blue screens - NT error

These occurrences of blue screens were caused by a communication outage to several Outlets. This resulted in a system crash at the
Counters. This problem with the network connection has now been resolved and a fix delivered to all gateway Counters in all
Outlets.

Girobank transaction report

A report fix was delivered to 1,100 Counters which caused the following scenario to occur in a number of Outlets who were
attempting to reverse a transaction. When a transaction was reversed, on a lower numbered Counter node, there was no evidence
on the Girobank summary that this reversal had taken place, although the correct information did go to POCL TIP. Some Outlets
realised this to be the case and altered the Girobank summary to reflect the correct transactions, Some Outlets however, completed

the reversal again, which resulted in a discrepancy for the value of this reversal. MSU have advised POCL of all Outlets where we
know a problem has occurred (after calls were received by the HSH) and a fix was delivered to the affected Counters on 31° the
problem with Giro reports on 26" January.

4.8 SUPPORTING COMMENTS

Section Performan:
4.1 HSHD - Calls answered within 4o seconds

HSHD - Calls abandoned through ring off

41 I HSHD - Level1 calls resolved within 5 minutes

Comments
Performance Summary

Performance against the SLA for calls answered within 40
seconds was 92.9%, and the performance against the SLA for
abandoned calls was 93.9%.

Although there was a significant improvement in the
telephone answering SLAs in January, the MAT still failed to
be achieved.

Cause

There was an increased volume of calls to the HSH in the last
week of January, due to the increase in Software calls (full
details appear in Section 2). This affected HSH's ability to
deal with incoming calls at that time

Action
Software fixes have been implemented. No action at HSH is
thought to be necessary at this point in time.

Performance Summary
The MAT was not achieved for Level 1 calls in January, as

88.4% of the calls were resolved within 5 minutes.

Cause

This is directly attributable to the ongoing Powerhelp
problems (slow response time) that have significantly
affected weeks two and three of the month.

The poor performance has been attributed to a network
capacity issue and a remote user running an associated

database which operates record locking when the remote
database and Powerhelp communicate.
Action
e Network capacity for remote system users has been
increased
© The record locking issue has only recently been
identified and is subject to process review.
4.2 Hardware / Network Priority A - ghrs non- Performance Summary

remedial 87.5% of priority 'A' H/N calls were resolved within ghrs and
6 hrs.

Hardware / Network Priority A - 6hrs remedial
Cause
Out ofa total of 8 priority 'A’ H/N calls in January, one failed
to be resolved within 6hrs (the actual resolution time was
6hrs 35mins), and this resulted in the MAT not being
achieved.
The Hardware call which failed to meet the SLA was routed
to the Engineer within 38 minutes of the call being logged.
The Engineer then arrived on site 86 minutes later, and the
site visit involved swapping the base unit.
The base unit was subsequently swapped out a further two
times, following repeated failures. This extended the length
of the call.
Action
On-going review of quality of kit.

42 I Hardware / Network Priority B - 8hrs non- Performance Summary

remedial Conformance was not achieved for priority 'B’ H/N calls in

January. 84.4% of priority 'B' H/N calls were resolved within

Version: 3.0

Hardware / Network Priority B - 1ohrs remedial 8hrs, and 90.5% of calls were resolved within 1ohrs.
Cause
This was due to an on-going process issue, where calls were
unnecessarily delayed after being passed to second line
support (SMC), before being routed to an Engineer.
Action
This problem has been escalated through the ICL Pathway
Management Team.
Stringent measures have now been enforced to address the
above problem and improved performance is expected in
February.

43 I Data Services - RDMC Reference Data Delivery by I Performance Summary

Day D 99.8% of RDMC Reference Data was delivered by Day D.
Cause
The failure of this SLA is attributed to the non-polling of
Outlets, as non-polling is the key input to this calculation.
Action
The non-polled Outlet procedures are being reviewed to
ensure that we can identify where an Outlet fails to poll as a
direct result of either an Horizon system fault, or an activity

therefore the MAT was not achieved in December.

N.B, APS transactions which have been delivered to HAPS
after day D, are identified on the ‘Polling Exception’ report.

Cause

Due to specific reasons for non-polling of APS transactions,
(for example communication failure, Post Offices off-line due
to burglary etc.), day D transaction delivery has not been
achieved for the month as a whole. We would confirm that
all files have been transmitted to HAPS in accordance with
the agreed timescales and the SLA failure is directly
attributable to these transactions which have not been
polled.

Action

The non-polled Outlet procedures are being reviewed to
ensure that we can identify where an Outlet fails to poll as a
direct result of either an Horizon system fault or an activity
which has taken place outside of the control of ICL Pathway,
for example a burglary ora Counter switch off. These
procedures will be introduced as soon as they have been
tested. It is expected that this will be within the next month,

Data Services - OBCS File Delivery

Due to a problem with the Harvesting process, one of the
OBCS data files had a corruption in the transaction date field
and thus failed to update one of the Data Warehouse tables.
This information is only retained for three days and therefore
we are unable to calculate the SLA achievement for the full
month of January, as only five days worth of data were
available. A fix has been developed which is currently
undergoing testing. However, we cannot recalculate the SLA
as the data is no longer available. A further update will be
available at the Service Review Forum.
