Dear Mr. Gilliland,
RE: Crichton Ave Post Office

Thank you for your email response of 16'* September to my contact regarding the temporary closure
of Crichton Avenue Post Office in York.

tam pleased to see the Post Office re-opened and to read that you are continuing to work with Ms
Martin to solve any problems with the phone line.

However, I am still concerned that the issue of the figures not balancing on the system is still un-
addressed.

During the recent refurbishment of Crichton Avenue Post Office, the phone lines and services
connected to those lines were the responsibility of the Post Office Ltd. Therefore, the resulting
errors in balances found as a result of the fault on the phone line remain the responsibility of Post
Office Ltd.

Please could I kindly ask you to address this issue in your response.

Yours sincerely,

Rachael Maskell MP
