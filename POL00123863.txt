Hi Robert

Your first Crown Programme assignment!

Alex Syme from the Crown team has reviewed the L&G policy, please find it attached. Could you
please review this and let me know your thoughts. Please be bold. The previous version was very old,
around 2007/8 I believe so things have changed a great deal. If you think something needs
changing/amending etc then let me know your thoughts. Also, if you think anyone else should input
within our team then please do get their feedback also.

Sorry to ask but any chance of getting this done before we meet next week at all ©

I will also add my input when we meet and then we will progress.

Thanks Robert,
