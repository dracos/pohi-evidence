Thank you for your email.

No. | do not understand.
Can you tell me how you attempted to trace victims of the Horizon scheme?

| was not contacted -as others were- and therefore your "fairness" most certainly does not apply.
How was | supposed to find out about the scheme?

Please reply and explain.

Dear Mary

Thank you for your email about the Historical Shortfall Scheme. We are sorry it has

taken some time to provide a response but would like to assure you that your enquiry

has been considered carefully.

The Scheme was open for 3 months and closed on 14 August 2020. In addition we
allowed 15 more weeks for Postmasters with exceptional circumstances to apply.
However, this ‘grace period’ passed quite some time ago and in order to ensure that
we are able to progress those applications within the scheme in a fair and timely
manner, we are unable to accept any further applications into the Scheme.

We do recognise that this will likely be disappointing news for you but hope that you
understand the reason for our decision and wish you all the best.
