Subject: Re: Catch-up

Will, hi. Am tied up presently but will try to call you about 6.45 pm? I'm free till 7.30pm and then after 10pm, if I
miss you. Otherwise, tomorrow after 9.30am (I'm with Fujitsu CEO before that).

No problem with you speaking with Ian. we should keep this whole thing as transparent as possible. Although
keen to understand why James might have suggested it was a good idea. But we can pick that up when we

speak.

Thanks for sitting in on the James call.

Hi Paula,

Let me know when tomorrow might be good to catch-up. I'm leaving the office now but could do a call on my
mobile later if that's preferable. I can give you a read-out of Jo's call with James and I'd be keen for a read-out
of your meeting with Second Sight. Also, James suggested to Jo that one of her officials (would be me or Mike)
call lan Henderson at 2nd Sight. Would that present any issues?
