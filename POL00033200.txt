1.1 Background

The Horizon Next Generation (HNG) Programme was established to
provide simplified network software platform architecture, based on
centralised, rather than distributed, processing. The new simplified
Horizon Online system, delivered by the HNG Programme, will
facilitate the introduction of future changes, be easier to manage and
supports the requirement for network flexibility. The software solution
is component or modular based, which will support greater re-use and
speedier future development. It makes use of modern, standardised
technologies, which enable lower cost of ownership, easier integration
with external systems and reduced service management costs.

The HNG Programme did not seek to add new functionality to the
existing Horizon system. The Programme applied the principle of
‘Business Equivalence’. This meant that the new Horizon Online
system covers the same functionality as before, although the user
interface looks different to the frontline user and Postal Services were
enhanced. In total, approximately £10m worth of business change
was_ introduced. Though the functionality has been largely
unchanged, the Programme has introduced a wide range of “behind
the scenes” changes that affect all aspects of the current service,
including data centres, field service and telecommunications. The
Programme also required some new equipment in branches; a
communication router in each branch to improve ‘in-branch’
availability by removing the reliance on the current Gateway

terminals, and the installation of new counter printers at each counter
position to overcome issues with the previous printers.

Objectives/Achievements Comparison

Key objectives of the Programme were as follows:

Contractual and Financial Objectives

The contract for the delivery of HNG will be agreed and signed
off by the end of August 2006. (Achieved)

HNG will provide significant savings in IT costs over the life of
the contract. This is crucial to POL IT achieving the 50%
reduction in IT costs needed as part of the transformation of the
Business.

The amended contract with Fujitsu Services covers the period
2010 to 2015. (Achieved)

Deliver new solution within Business Case financials (Achieved)
Fujitsu Services will work with POL to improve the 50%
reduction in IT costs through joint working under the Systems
Integration Partnership (SIP) strive.
(Achieved and continuing)

Note that the full details of financial objectives are contained within
the Business Case.

The requirements defined ensure that:

The new system is more flexible and simpler so that it can be
modified easily to meet the needs of the changing Business.
The new system is able to operate to newly defined service
levels, which better meet the needs of the Business.
Operational change was minimised as far as possible to reduce
training and familiarisation costs and timescales.

The Programme delivered a Business Equivalent system,
except where changes were explicitly agreed or required, due to
IPR not being owned by either Fujitsu Services or POL.

The modified design should enable reductions in the time to
market for major developments and new products brought into
service.

Changes to the interfaces with all external systems were
minimised.

Where identified and agreed with the Programme, the new

system supported other POL initiatives e.g. Rural Strategy.

The HNG Requirements baseline defines, and the HNG Applications
supports, the operation of Post Office business processes in a
manner that achieves the same business outcomes for PO Ltd and its
Clients and achieves the same operational effect within a Branch, as
currently provided by Horizon at the agreed baseline (“Business
Equivalence’).

2.1 Financial Results

The programme continues to forecast delivery of the Business Case
significantly below baseline cost.

Furthermore, POL continues to receive in excess of the full Business
Case benefits, plus additional benefits derived from other events and
actions by the programme team. This represented a contribution in
excess of £56.1m per annum (target £43.6m) in 2009/10 and a
forecast of £58.6m (target £52.7m) for 2010/11.

The summary Business Case position is as follows:

2.2 Operational Impact

2.2.1 Data Centre

The Data Centre design for HNG-X moves away from an
‘active/active’ configuration and adopts the more customary
configuration where the primary site serves production and the other
remains on standby for use in disaster recovery, thus allowing the
disaster recovery site to be used as the testing environment. The
Data Centres at Wigan & Bootle were successfully moved to Northern
Ireland where there is one Data Centre in constant operation with a
disaster recovery back up data centre nearby. This was completed
on 31/10/2009, initially servicing Horizon, then moving through a

POL00033200
combined Horizon and Horizon Online service, and finally to Horizon
Online only. The Data Centres at Wigan and Bootle were
decommissioned over 2 weekends, completing on 10 October 2010.

2.2.2 Branch Router Migration

The branch router is compatible with all branch communication types;
ADSL, ISDN (including Kingston Communication ISDN branches) and
branches with ADSL as primary communications and ISDN for back
up communications and VSAT. It has an inbuilt mobile broadband
wireless network (WWAN) using either Orange or Vodafone service
providers, which the router will switch to if the primary
communications fail.

The Branch Router assumes the communications role of the gateway
terminal, and routes all data to and from the data centres in Northern
Ireland, to and from all counter terminals in the branch.

All branches have one router installed, near what was previously the
gateway terminal. Where a branch operates portable Horizon
equipment (Core and Outreach branches); there is one router
installed, which is taken with the portable equipment to every service
point.

The existing ISDN luggable terminal was replaced with a Portable
Horizon Unit (PHU) version 2 on migration to Horizon Online™.

2.2.3 Horizon Online User Interface

The Horizon Online User Interface (Ul) was designed to be intuitive
and easy to use. The biggest change from the Horizon system is how
the system looks on screen and the way in which the user navigates
to products and services. Whilst the new system looks quite different,
the products and services have not changed. Anecdotal comments
captured from the Kendata' questionnaire feedback have been very
positive. Attached are a few examples from postmasters following
migration to Horizon Online.

“It is quick and efficient.”
“Seems a lot simpler than feared!”

‘ Kendata is the external company who scanned the questionnaires and provided weekly MI
reports and details of all comments provided by the Post Office branches.

POL00033200
POL00033200
“Horizon online seems to be quicker and more explanatory, especially
the help button.”

“When the new system is in you find it much easier to use than you
thought.”

“l was very anxious before we migrated but I think it is a great system
now. I got the hang of it easily enough.”

“Online Help is really useful. It lets you answer customer queries
without leaving the counter.”

2.2.4 Counter Training Office (CTO)

The CTO solution for Horizon Online™ required the installation of a
new ADSL communications line as the CTO is connected into the
Horizon Online™ Data Centres.

2.3 Technical Impact

The System Overview is described in the HNG Solution Architecture
Outline ARC/SOL/ARC/0001 but for convenience a high level
description is repeated here from paragraph 1.3 of that document.

The HNG-X solution is based on a set of business applications that
support a centralised model for data storage. The counters retain
operational data (e.g. Reference Data) and business logic, but
transactional information is stored directly in the Data Centre.

The counter side of the new applications is based on Java
technology. The counter hardware and operating system are reused
from Horizon. A number of legacy databases and applications are
retained at central level. The Disaster Resilience model proposed in
HNG-x is based on one live and one stand-by Data Centre. The Live
Data Centre is reinforced to provide local resilience. The stand-by
Data Centre is a copy of the live one. The primary storage arrays of
the two Data Centres are kept aligned using synchronous replication
technology. The stand-by Data Centre is also used for testing
purposes. Failover technology is used to enable the switch of the
Data Centre from stand-by to operational within contractual time
frames.

The Network solution is based on a combination of low-cost ADSL,
ISDN, and mobile technology. Routers were installed in all Branches
prior to the rollout of the new applications.

2.4 Financial Areas of Success and Failure Planning and
Implementation
2.4.1 Plan Slippage

Over the lifetime of the HNG Programme, the plan has been delayed
and re-baselined on several occasions by Fujitsu for different
reasons. Slippage of Programme milestone dates have been
challenged and accepted. POL has not been financially penalised for
slippage of Programme plan dates due to the contract protecting the
full business case benefits independent of when the solution is
actually delivered and the actions of the POL HNG Programme team.

Key areas where the HNG Programme Plan slipped were due to:
¢ Delays in solution development
e Delays to testing, issues with test rigs

e Branch router roll out delays impacting start of branch migration
pilot

e Data Centre Migration delays

e Data Centre Outages resulting in suspension of branch
migration pilot

2.4.2 Financial Success

POL negotiated in the contract with Fujitsu to protect the full Business
Case benefits in the event of delays attributable to Fujitsu. Also,
additional benefits have subsequently been derived from further
actions by the programme team to reduce POL costs. Overall this
means that the Programme has delivered ahead of the Business
Case, with a financial contribution in excess of £56.1m per annum
(target £43.6m) in 2009/10 and a forecast of £56.8m (target £52.6m)
for 2010/11. Despite the HNG Programme timescales slipping
against the original planned milestones, as stated above, POL were
not penalised financially as the Business Case benefits were
protected.

2.5 Quality of Service

2.5.1 NBSC and HSD Statistics

Throughout the pilot and roll out of Horizon Online, call volumes and
incidents to NBSC and HSD have been tracked and summarised in a
daily report (see attached). A few incidents, such as system outages
and printer problems have resulted in pressure on the call centres.
However, mitigations put in place averted any major disruption to

2.5.2 6 Dials Report

HSD call statistics and engineer visits to branches have been tracked
via the ‘6 Dials’ report (see attached), which is produced by Fujitsu
Customer Services. This report provides detailed analysis of the type
and frequency of calls to the HSD and the level of engineering service
provided if required. The statistics illustrate that whilst there have
been incidents which have resulted in pressure on the helpdesk and
engineer service, both of these have been able to cope with the
workload. This MI continues to be monitored on a daily basis.

2.6 Operational Performance

To ensure that the capacity of IT services and the IT infrastructure is
able to deliver the agreed service level targets (SLT) in a cost-
effective and timely manner. Capacity Management considers all
resources required to deliver the IT service, and plans for short,
medium and long term business requirements. As part of the service
management requirements, Fujitsu produce a monthly report for
review, which outlines the key statistics for the previous period. This
report is then used to manage risks, issues and improvements to the
Horizon Online estate.

An example of the Capacity Management Report (August 2010) is
attached.

3 Costs and Benefits Review

3.1 Business Equivalence

The HNG Requirements baseline defines, and the HNG Applications
supports, the operation of Post Office business processes in a
manner that achieves the same business outcomes for PO Ltd and its
Clients and achieves the same operational effect within a Branch, as
currently provided by Horizon at the agreed baseline (“Business
Equivalence’).

3.2 Transaction Timings

The HNG Programme Team conducted benchmarking on timings for
transaction/back office reports for the Horizon system against Horizon
Online.

Early analysis was very positive, with postal services in Horizon
Online in excess of 20% faster than Horizon. Only two transactions
have deteriorated with respect to speed of execution; a simple stamp
sale by 6% which was expected, and Debit Card payment, which was
not. It is suspected that the Debit Card issue is due to the emulator
used during testing (not the true live system) and this is currently
under investigation. This has not been observed in live operation and
is expected to be resolved imminently.

There is very positive news in terms of back office timings, with all
report production on Horizon Online taking less time compared with
the old Horizon solution. This mirrors the positive feedback received
from the Network.

Horizon system against Horizon Online given to Richard Barker,
Director of Sales, POL, attached.

3.3 Wireless Back-Up Network

The branch router is compatible with all branch communication types;
ADSL, ISDN (including Kingston Communication ISDN branches) and
branches with ADSL as primary communications and ISDN for back
up communications and VSAT. It has an inbuilt mobile broadband
wireless network (WWAN) using either Orange or Vodafone service
providers, which the router will switch to if the primary
communications fail.

3.4 Impact on Help Desks

Since full rollout commenced, the NBSC experienced an increase in
call volumes above those predicted. The main issues that had a
direct impact on performance levels were:

¢ a lack of understanding of Branch Trading (no change to the
procedure but branches still required hand-holding)

¢ error messages relating to which trading period the branch was
in

e branches failing to select the correct IVR option.

Outbound activity was also extended at minus one week to migration,
as a result of over 60% of branches failing to complete their training.
This was above initial forecasts which were felt to be very generous.
However, it is possible that the ongoing delays to the solution rollout
may have attributed to a lack of action in this area.

NBSC have managed the increased volumes whilst service levels
were hit. The overall service to the branches throughout what has
been a massive Programme for POL, was excellent, given the various
challenges faced and dealt with. Royal Mail Customer Services, as a
supplier, has committed all it can to manage the impact of HNGX and
should be commended for what has been achieved.

On HSD, there were numerous system outages, including blue /
turquoise screens and an increase in inappropriate calls, which
impacted on NBSC, caused by branches choosing the wrong IVR
option. However, initial service levels of the desk were unaffected
until the latter part of the rollout that was further aggravated through
the gold label printer issue, which was non-HNG related. All the
system issues have now been resolved and the impact has subsided.
There are no issues on the desk at present.

6 Risks Realised
The key themes for risks realised

6.1 Solution Functionality and Scope

The scope of the HNG Programme changed over the course of its
lifetime. Before decisions were made, these changes were
documented as risks, which subsequently became decisions; the
deferral of Auto Fault Logging and migration from Windows NT to
Windows XP operating system. In the early stages of the
Programme, consideration was given to refreshing all the counter
hardware, but due to cost constraints, this was scaled down to only
include the counter printers and the installation of branch routers to
assume the communications role of the gateway terminal. The
solution for an alternative to the WWAN back up network, in areas
where there is insufficient signal strength, has yet to be resolved.

In order to provide a stable state of the Horizon system to apply
business equivalence to, a Change Freeze was put in place. This
affected the rest of the business as all new CRs and CPDs during the
period had to include budget for both Horizon and Horizon Online
changes where applicable. Though this change was necessary, its
impact was mitigated by robust communications and HNG attendance
at the Business Change Acceptance Board (BCAP) which
subsequently became the Gating Forum.

POL00033200
POL00033200
6.2 Plan Slippage

Throughout the HNG Programme, the plan has shifted to the right on
a number of occasions by Fujitsu Services, for various reasons.
Slippage of Programme milestone dates have been challenged,
accepted and the plan re-baselined. Where the slippage was
significant, acceptance of the revised plans has been made via
contractual changes. Key areas of slippage include solution
development, solution testing (construction and contention for test
rigs), data centre migration, branch router roll out, solution pilot and
roll out. Though there have been significant delays to the HNG
Programme delivery, Programme Management has consistently
emphasised the importance of delivering a quality product. Early
indications are that the new system is working well and proving to be
popular with the Network users. This justifies the delays to product
delivery encountered.

6.3 Personnel

The HNG Programme suffered from the frequent replacement of the
Fujitsu Programme Manager and other key Programme posts within
the Fujitsu Programme team. There was a diversion of Senior Fujitsu
resource away from HNG to respond to other non-HNG work e.g.
ITTs from RMG. This resulted in a lack of continuity in the
Programme at times, which was frustrating. However, consistency of
POL personnel working on HNG was advantageous; knowing the full
history and context of Programme deliverables and issues gave POL
a stronger position when negotiating contractual details. The
contention with Horizon for Fujitsu Test resource and reliance on
certain critical individuals’ expertise resulted in some key staff
bottlenecks within Fujitsu. This contributed to the plan slippage in
addition to the factors described in section 5.2.

6.4 Stakeholder Management

The Business Change team was tasked with managing the HNG
stakeholders. Stakeholder risks emerged at various times during the
Programme, resulting from slippage to the plan dates and system
outages during the pilot and roll out phase; pressure from BAU to
provide actual dates for key Programme activities during periods of
uncertainty and losing the support of the NFSP for a period during
March and April due to system outages caused by Data Centre
incidents and errors. Though these risks were realised to some
degree, the extent of these were mitigated by effective stakeholder
engagement and communications. A separate risk resulted from

Horizon Online User Interface was designed, developed and tested
with the involvement of over 400 Horizon users. Feedback was taken
from sub-postmasters and staff from around the country during
conferences, exhibitions and meetings whilst the prototype of the
User Interface was being demonstrated. In that time, the HNG team
met with over 3,000 people. See Section 2.2.3

The following is an overview of the testing effort. These high-level
figures are taken from Quality Centre (QC).

10.5 Stakeholder Satisfaction

From September 2007, the HNG Business Stakeholder Engagement
team, part of Business Change, carried out monthly interviews with
selected key stakeholders to measure the ongoing level of satisfaction
of these individuals with the HNG Programme. By measuring
stakeholder satisfaction the Programme Team was able to ensure
that stakeholder requirements were being met and to allow for them to
identify and take appropriate action to improve satisfaction when
necessary.

Up to 30 stakeholders were identified for interview at any one time.
The stakeholders interviewed were changed during the course of the
programme to reflect changes in personnel and the business
organisation. Each stakeholder was scheduled for interview once
every three months with 8 interviews targeted for completion in each
month. As stakeholder participation was on a voluntary basis, the
actual number of interviews completed each month did vary. To
maximise the number of questionnaires completed each month, if a
stakeholder was not available for a face-to-face interview, he/she was
able to complete and return a paper questionnaire.

The overall level of stakeholder satisfaction for the duration of the
programme is summarised in the table below.

12.2.2 Collateral for audit purposes

Programme minutes, plans, organisation charts, historical
documentation and miscellaneous Programme artefacts will remain in
storage on the Lotus Notes Database, “Horizon Next Generation
Programme”, for audit purposes. Individuals who currently have
access to the Lotus Notes database will continue to do so going
forward. Therefore there is currently no need to move the content
under Programme and Office Control to another location.

Access will be restricted as some of the information stored in the
database is business sensitive.
