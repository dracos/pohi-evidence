Subject: Draft statement

Hi Paul,

Below is the very brief draft statement which George may want to add to. Just to recap, I think there is a
danger of the NFSP appearing to be slightly mis-aligned now from POL on this issue so I think the second part
is important.

Matt.

George Thomson, General Secretary of the NFSP, said: “While we have never been presented with clear
evidence that the Horizon system had failed to meet its primary purpose, we are nonetheless reassured that
the system has been found to be robust in an independent survey, and we continue to have confidence in it.

“We are also encouraged to see that Post Office Ltd does concede that there is always room for improvement
and scope for learning and we look forward to hearing from our members that support levels have increased as
they continue to use Horizon.”

Ends
