2.2 Confidentiality

2.2.1

2.2.2

Post Office agrees that any information disclosed to it in connection with the
Escher Upgrade Software which is designated by Fujitsu Services as “Escher
Confidential Information” shall be kept in strictest confidence and not disclosed
to any party except as permitted under this paragraph 2 of Schedule C3 and
paragraph 2 of Schedule B4.1.

Escher Confidential Information shall not comprise Confidential Information for
the purposes of this Agreement and, accordingly, the provisions of Clause 61
shall not apply to Escher Confidential Information.

Post Office shall:

(a) take all reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality of
Escher Confidential Information;

(b) not duplicate or reproduce Escher Confidential Information
except as necessary for the purposes of this Agreement; and

(c) upon termination of the Existing Licences, immediately return to
Fujitsu Services all documents and other materials which
contain or relate to Escher Confidential Information.

The non-disclosure and confidentiality provisions contained in this paragraph 2
of this Schedule C3 will survive the termination of any or all of its other provisions
but shall expire 20 years after the expiry or termination of this Agreement. Post
Office acknowledges and agrees that Fujitsu Services and any third party are, in
addition to other remedies, entitled to seek an injunction to prevent Post Office
from disclosing Escher Confidential Information in breach of this paragraph 2 of
this Schedule C3 and/or paragraph 2 of Schedule B4.1.

Post Office may with Fujitsu Services' written consent disclose Escher
Confidential Information to third parties. If Fujitsu Services agrees to allow Post
Office to disclose Escher Confidential Information to a third party, prior to making
any such disclosure, Post Office shall first obtain such third party’s written
agreement to comply with all non-disclosure and confidentiality terms herein.

Post Office shall keep a record of all disclosures by it of Escher Confidential
Information to third parties including the names of the persons to whom Escher
Confidential Information was disclosed by Post Office and a description of the
Escher Confidential Information disclosed.

Post Office may disclose Escher Confidential Information:

(a) if and to the extent required by law, regulation or by order of a
court of competent jurisdiction provided, however, that Post

Office shall in each case notify Fujitsu Services in advance of
such disclosure;

(b) to its professional advisers for the purposes of audit or receiving
professional advice;

(c) to employees and staff of Royal Mail Group plc to the extent that
such disclosure is necessary for such employees or staff to
perform functions relating to the development, operation, receipt
or management of the Existing Services;

(d) where such information was already in the public domain at the
time it was disclosed or otherwise received by the other party;

(e) where such information becomes part of the public domain after
disclosure by means other than breach of the confidentiality
obligations contained in this paragraph 2.2 of this Schedule C3;
or

(f) where such information came into a party's possession lawfully
from a third party that was, itself, lawfully in possession of that
information and entitled to distribute it.

Where Escher Confidential Information is disclosed under paragraphs 2.2.7(b) or
2.2.7(c) of this Schedule C3, Post Office shall procure that the third parties
referred to in those paragraphs shall not disclose that Escher Confidential
Information without the prior written consent of Fujitsu Services.

The Existing Licences and their contents are deemed Escher Confidential
Information and, subject to paragraph 2.2.7 of this Schedule C3, Post Office may
not disclose the Existing Licences to a third party without the express written
consent of Fujitsu Services, except that Post Office may disclose those elements
of the Existing Licences which relate to the use of the Escher Upgrade Software
to the operator replacing Fujitsu Services in the event a direct licence is to be
granted to that replacement operator under paragraph 2.2.3.4 of Schedule B4.1
provided that such operator has, in advance of such disclosure, entered into
substantially equivalent confidentiality provisions with Post Office as are set out
in this paragraph 2 of this Schedule C3.

Escher Upgrade Software related documentation, defect reports, and all other
non-public information related to the Escher Upgrade Software, are and shall be
deemed Escher Confidential Information.

2.3.1

2.3.2

If either Party believes the other to be in breach of any obligation imposed by
paragraph 2 of Schedule B4.1 and/or this paragraph 2 of this Schedule C3, the
non-breaching Party shall provide written notice of such breach to the other.

Upon receipt of such notice, if such breach exists, the recipient shall have twenty
(20) days to remedy such breach or provide assurances in a form reasonably
acceptable to the non-breaching Party that the breach will be corrected within
such longer period as the non-breaching Party may specify.

24 Termination

2.4.1

If a breach by Post Office of any obligation imposed by paragraph 2 of Schedule
B4.1 and/or this paragraph 2 of this Schedule C3 has not within the twenty (20)
day period provided under paragraph 2.3.2 of this Schedule C3 been remedied
or assurances, in a form reasonably acceptable to Fujitsu Services, provided to
Fujitsu Services that the breach will be corrected within such longer period as
Fujitsu Services may specify, Fujitsu Services may by notice in writing to Post
Office terminate the rights granted by paragraph 2.2.1 of Schedule B4.1 and
Fujitsu Services shall be relieved of its obligations under paragraph 2.2.3.4 of
Schedule B4.1.

Upon the earlier of (i) termination under paragraph 2.4.1 of this Schedule C3 of
the rights granted to Post Office by paragraph 2.2.1 of Schedule B4.1 or (ii)
Trigger Point T6 (Counter Application Rollout Complete), Post Office shall cease
