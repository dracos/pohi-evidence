For information
This is what James has sent. I am clearly on the copy list. I assume that JFSA and SS are also on the copy list.

David, could you please forward to Tony as a matter of courtesy to say that after some considerable to-ing and fro-ing
this has just gone out. We had asked for the opportunity to let you know in advance when it was going out but
unfortunately that did not happen. Paula has a call scheduled with JA tomorrow and we were not anticipating anything
going out before then.

Best wishes

Belinda

Subject: Post Office - proposed July meeting

Dear Colleague

I had hoped that we might schedule a meeting before summer during which the Post Office might offer us an
update on how the mediation scheme is progressing. To this end I have been in correspondence with Paula
Vennells, the Chief Executive, to see what might be arranged.

It appears that not a great deal can be added to what was said in our last meeting. The mediation scheme is
progressing, but at a slower pace than any of us would have liked. Rather than hold a meeting just before
Recess that will not reveal more than we already know, I would rather wait until autumn, but I do want to get
a date in the diary for a meeting then.

I attach a note that Paula has sent which sets out the progress made since our last meeting. She has
reiterated to me that the integrity of the mediation scheme requires that confidentiality of cases be respected.
In a letter to me she has also said that individual case details may not be shared with us at any point,
including at the end of the Scheme.

I would like to believe that at the end of the Scheme we will be presented with a report which shows why and
how we got to the stage where so many individuals were (and still are) coming forward with their concerns
and their often harrowing stories. I do believe that the mediation scheme has a good chance of righting
things, but we shall all need clarity as to what happened and why, and how it is being put right.

Yours ever,
James
