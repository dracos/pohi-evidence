I spoke to Jenee about the disclosure material in this case. We may need to speak to the case officer in
person to work out what this extra material is and to make a decision re disclosure.

Also, looking at her prepared statement I think we need NAE's covering the following:

NAE from Allen as to why no extra traininig was given on handover; was this because she already knew how
the systems worked to a good standard?

NAE from Portch: how much cash she would expect/guidance indicates should be held at an office like this
one

extent and details of her training on Horizon

her handover, how it happened, what help/training she got

NAE from Collin Woodridge recalls talking to her re a shortfall of £1500 in late 2003

Also, do we have details of witness orders?
