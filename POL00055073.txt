This is the response that ! have received from Penny following Issy Hogg’s e-mail.
I've had a discussion with Gareth.

It was agreed during the meeting between Gareth and Charles that Charles would provide notes refiecting
the discussion; Gareth has not yet received these.

His views on the email string are:-

4. Access to system in Midlands: This was not something we discussed in detail. It would appear that
Charles is aware of a Post Office which is having issues similar to those which have resulted in
prosecution, but that there are currently no prosecutions in place. He would like to monitor exactly
what happens in this branch (probably with a video camera) and compare that with the system logs
(hoping to find a mismatch!). However the Postmaster is covered by confidentiality agreements,
which mean that this cannot be done with out permission of POL. I assume that this is a request to
be able to do this. I'm also assuming that help would be required from Fujitsu in retrieving logs from
the system to compare with the video. NB this probably needs to be done quickly before migrating to
HNG-X. Charles's first report refers fo such a branch I believe. I’ve no idea where this postmaster
would stand in respect of any problems that they have had but which are not yet visible to POL, or in
respect of what they have already said to Charles.

2. Access to Chesterfield: Charles is still of the opinion that understanding how P&BA operate and in
particular how they identify errors and process them as Transaction Corrections may help his case.
I've pointed out that anyihing in this area that could affect the accounts is already visible to him in the
Horizon logs and so I don't see that this is likely to be of help to him. However he would still like to
pursue this line of exploration.

3. System Change Requests: Basically, he was asking to look at all system faults. I suggested that as
we kept all testing and Live faults in the same system and that there were around 200,000 of them,
then this wasn’t going fo get him far. He then suggested looking at system changes and would like to
see all changes that have happened to the system. Again, I don't think this will help and I don't know
how practical it is for Fujitsu's Release Management to provide that. I think all we can do is ask the
question.

As already stated in my earlier e-mail to you, for point 1 I need to know from the defence specifically
which office in the midlands that they want to monitor and how they intend to monitor it.

For point 2 a visit to Chesterfield can be arranged but there are ten departments dealing with transaction
corrections and it would be helpful to know which specific transaction errors they wish to examine the
process for.

As for point 3, I will ask Penny Thomas whether Fuj
defence expert with system fault data.

u's Release Management team can provide the

Could I ask you to clarify Points 1 & 2. with the defence so that I can see whether we can agree to their
requests.
