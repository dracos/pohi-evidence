Hi Laura

Apologies for delay; yes, that approach is fine to me. Absolutely agree this should be a spokesperson line, rather than a
named Minister.

All — please see attached submission to Jo on the changes POL are planning to make to the Horizon mediation scheme.

Richie — we spoke about this earlier, let me know what you think.

Tim, James — would really appreciate your thoughts on this from a cold read. There is a lot of information to try and get
across at high level, and I’d welcome some fresh eyes on it to check whether it makes any sense.

Hannah — happy to chat through this but the broad thrust is: this scheme is independent of Government, it’s up to Post
Office if they want to change it, so we recommend minimal HMG involvement and reactive press only using a BIS
spokesperson quote not a Minister. Do you agree with that? I am WFH today but available on mobile number below or
if you want to chat.

This needs to go in the box today, we have until 2.30pm. So swift thoughts welcome please!
Thanks
Laura
