@ New product to be welcomed.
@ Negotiating Committee worked hard to get as much as
possible for Subpostmasters for the transaction.
@ One query is the affect on sales of postage stamps as they
will no longer be required on postal orders. Awaiting
information from Post Office Limited.
© Interim offer to be reviewed once real data is available
recommended for acceptance by the Negotiating Committee.
@ There followed: considerable discussion on the subject.
e it was felt by the Negotiating Committee that the transaction
would be quicker with less back office work.
@  Deliberately pitched to be cheaper than a bankers draft and
new upper limited of £250.
@ Percentage based payment did not stack up at the lower end y
of the range. ‘
@ When issued, Horizon will generate a serial number to be ‘
held on a database. When cashed, bar code scanned and
automatically checked against database so fraud will be less
likely. Serial number also shown on receipt (no counterfoil).
@ Negotiating Committee to go back to Post Office Limited to
try to achieve a higher payment for the transaction. ACTION

Billi Payment PC SP 01
© Previous debate told Post Office Limited to bid to win bill

payment business.

Paypoint and Payzone doing very well in the market and
have acquired some large contracts.

They are doing it very cheaply as they attract footfall to
outlets.

Offer for South Eastem Electric is 7p for Subpostmasters.

Bill payment also drives core tier payment.

If offer accepted it would reduce transaction pay from
£22.3 million to £14 million, a reduction of £8.73 million.

BT going out to tender one year early.

Horizon cannot deal with the latest update in Quantum pre
payments.

Other avenue is Paystation with a payment of 7p and no
contribution to core tier payment.

Negotiating Committee trying to get more Paystations than
the currently planned 3,000.

Various possible options were discussed around the
remuneration for bill payment.

The Negotiating Committee feared that Subpostmasters
would do the work for 7p to retain the footfall.

A request was made to find out what Paystation and
Payzone charged their clients.

Offices worst hit by ACT would almost certainly be worst hit
by the drop in payment levels.

Negotiating Committee to find out exactly what Post Office
Limited take from the transaction.

Negotiating Committee to take to the highest levels at Post
Office Limited as they could not accept such a reduction in
Subpostmaster remuneration but it would be a real fight.
