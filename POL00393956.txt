Business Service Management _- Summary Report for NRO Board
08 December 2000

A summary of key helpdesk statistics is attached at annex A. For further statistics and wider
business performance analysis please consult the MoLE report and ICL Service Review Book.
These are available from the Operational Performance Team within BSM.

ICL Pathway Performance against Service Levels

Following ICL Pathway’s failure to achieve Service Levels in three quarters, (particularly in the data
delivery and time to fix areas) they are now obliged to agree rectification plans and timescales with PON.
Although the deadline was the 30% November discussions are continuing, and a further update will be
provided in next months report.

Problems in month
Non Polling - (Annex D refers)

The level of non polling outlets continues to be a concer as the percentage remains relatively static in
relation to rollout numbers , but taken in isolation still appear to increasing. A further commercial focus
has now heen placed on this topic as ICLP have failed their SLA on this area for over 3 months now. An
SLA rectification forum met on 9 November, lead by Liz Tuddenham and ICLP presented what they were
doing to address this shortcoming. In the meantime, operational focus has continued, lead by Problem
Management. Although Problem Management have kept management focus high, the ICLP proposed
solutions will not come into play until at least April 2001. In the meantime, PON are having to deal with
the Client / Customer impacts that exist.

Help Line Issues
Post Office Customer Management Performance (Tier 1 NBSC)

Only one of the seven main SLA's was achieved - that being the Resolution Rate which at 78.7% is the
highest figure yet.

Calls received were approx 20% higher than forecast due to the issues surrounding the CSR+ upgrade
and the second full month of Retail Line Review. The CSR+ upgrade which contributed to over 50% of the
extra calls (over forecast) finished in the first week of December and expectations are that normal
answering standards will be resumed. During the period of the upgrade there was regularly a flood of
calls to the NBSC in the early part of the morning,, which despite a number of shift pattern slides still
overwhelmed the operation. Dramatic falls in ACD type SLA results occurred (eg 1-8 November and 20-
24 November) around major CSR issues regarding : upgrade failures; lack of workbook delivery ; LFS
and transfer date problems.

The new call salutation, transfer of call and closing salutation has been agreed and is being rolled out
during week commencing 18" December . This follows feedback in the Customer Satisfaction survey and
NBSC advisors . Communications are planned.

The new Quality Measurement System has been agreed and will be implemented in December 2000 and
will form part of the SLA's reporting process from January onwards. This is a significant step forward and
shows the NBSC’s commitment to ensuring the delivery of a quality service.

From a supplier/relationship perspective, Mark Haynes has expressed a number of concerns around the
POCM operation and their desire to meet PON standards and targets. An escalation meeting was held on
5% December between Geraldine Collie, Jon Abrahams, Wendy Meehan and Susan Howlett (from
POCM) and Mark Haynes and Harvey Skipsey (PON). These concerns were discussed and a positive way
forward was agreed, Mark is awaiting the delivery of these actions over the next few weeks.

Main areas of concern are around : Business Systems and the system resilience ; Tier 1 training and
operational performance/ability; future capacity requirements and the overall proactiveness from POCM
to address issues.

Single Point of Contact Update

Following agreement to proceed with Phase 1 of SPOC at a meeting with Keith Baines and Tony
Oppenheim on Friday 1 December, a draft discussion paper has been issed by POCM with the intention
to meet with ICL Pathway, PON and POCM in Dearne House on Thursday 7 December. A technical
document will be produced which will allow ICL Pathway to fully respond to the Change Request
produced a few weeks ago. It is expected to implement SPOC at NBSC using a front end Interactive Voice
Response (IVR) during January 2001.

CSR+ Migration

This is due to be completed during week commencing 4% December and a number of learning, points will
have been realised. Too many problems have surfaced which in turn has led to concerns being raised
within the NBSC about the overall process adopted - e.g. upgrade failures; lack of workbook delivery ;
LFS and transfer date problems.

additional errors at the end of the Horizon roll out. To provide a full picture of error clearance costs the baseline cost
of £4.Smillion needs to be added to the above giving 2000/01 full year costs of £Smillion. 2001/02 costs are
£4.7million).

Polling failures reported on Monday 27th November (relating to failures which took place on the
evenings of Friday 24th - Sunday 26th) were at an unusually high level of 1233 offices. ICL Pathway's
Management Support Unit reported that this was due to migration/ upgrade issues. This has dropped to
453 reported on Tuesday 28th November & 355 on Wednesday 29th (Wednesday's figure equates to
approximately 2.3% of the live estate, and is consistent with the weekly average for the previous two
weeks).

BSM Problem Management are monitoring the situation; given ICL Pathway's explanation, it is expected
that the level should begin to fall once upgrades are complete. ICL Pathway have expressed the view that
although there are issues around new migrations which contribute to the level of polling failures, none of
these are peculiar to migration to CSR+ and were present during migration from Release Ic to CSR+.
