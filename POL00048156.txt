REGINA v HUGHIE NOEL THOMAS
CAERNARFON CROWN COURT
TRIAL - 25"" SEPTEMBER 2006

Juliet has passed me a letter from the Defence Solicitors Tudor Owen Roberts
Glynne & Co via our Agents Hill Dickinson. The Defence are requesting the daily
records sheets prepared by their Client which they advise are required urgently.

I have noted your letter to Juliet dated the 11" July when you advised that all
requested documentation was made available to Mr Jenner of Baker Tilly and so
I can only assume that Mr Jenner was not aware that these were required earlier
although Tudor Owen Roberts Glynne & Co do mention in paragraph 1(a) of their
letter of the 6" July “Daily paperwork for all transactions”.

They have not stated over what period they require the daily record sheets and I
am not aware therefore as to what sort of bulk they constitute. Could you kindly
contact Mark Jenner of Baker Tilly and if the sheets that he requires are too
bulky I suggest that he again visits your premises to inspect them.

Please could you let me know what arrangements have been made so that I can
inform our Agents.
