Summary of Whistleblowing reports received 2019-20

There have been numerous reports submitted by and about employees at a specific
non-customer facing location, and each report has been investigated independently.
This trend has been raised with the appropriate HR representative to carry out site
visits and investigate if there are any underlying root causes or issues at this location.
As a result of Covid-19 restrictions, a number of planned site visits for the end of the
year have been postponed until restrictions are lifted.

e¢ 41 whistleblowing reports were received and 43 cases were closed. (a number of
cases closed were historic from 2018/19)

e The majority of the allegations were about branches (14 reports). There were 9
reports made about Post Office employees (this includes back-office, DMB and
Supply Chain employees).

e There has been a decrease in anonymous reports being submitted, showing that
reporters have increased trust in POL to manage their concerns effectively. Most
anonymous reports are about employees (4).
