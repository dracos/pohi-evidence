Symptoms

A cash declaration was made in "Stock Balancing" for the amount displayed on the Snapshot. When the Cash Variance was checked afterwards a
Gain of £45.05 was displayed.<br/><br/>****<br/>May get PMs calling in to stating that they've been declaring cash but have been getting varying
discrepancies reported even though they've been declaring the same amount of cash each time.

Problem

The underlying problem is that we cache the current trading position for a Stock Unit and rely on a mechanism (in Riposte) to notify us of new
transactions across the outlet to keep this cache up to date.<br/><br/>When this fails it affects Discrepancy, Variance and Balance Reports and has
the effect of presenting the clerk with incorrect information. This will be potentially confusing and may lead to the clerk making unnecessary
corrections. These will in turn show up as future inconsistencies (eg nothing gets lost in the end).

Solution - Helpdesk

<b>Helpdesk:</b><br/>The Declare Cash problem clears itself overnight. If the PM logs a call on the day he is having problems, ask him to try the
following workaround:<br/><br/>1. The clerk should log out of the affected counter.<br/>2. Another clerk attached to a different (individual, not
shared) stock unit should log into the <b>same</b> counter, declare cash for his own stock unit, then logout.<br/>3. The first clerk can now login to
the same counter and declare cash again. The variance should be correctly recalculated. <br/><br/>If the workaround is not successful or the
problem does not clear itself overnight, send a call to SSC, otherwise no call is needed.<br/><br/>This problem is unlikely to be fixed as it will
disappear with the arrival of HNG-X. But since it is being reported quite a lot, PC0146170 has been sent to development May 2007.

Evidence

If there is any pattern of failure eg it is occuring on the same counter repeatedly.<br/>Can the audit log (c:\temp\audit<day>.log) be recovered if this
occurs please?
