From my friend:

Oh dear...Panorama is indeed in for 17 August. Here's the BBC release:
Trouble At The Post Office

The Post Office has prosecuted dozens of postmasters after their computers showed that money
had gone missing. Some have been jailed but could there be other explanations for the cash
shortfalls?

Reporter John Sweeney meets a whistle-blower who says there were problems with the computer
system. And he investigates claims that the Post Office charged some postmasters with theft even
when the evidence didn't stack up.
