Dear Board

A number of you have expressed interest in attending the Opening Submissions to the Post Office Horizon Statutory
Inquiry next week.

The Opening Submissions will commence next Tuesday, 11 October with Post Office’s oral submissions due to be given
on Friday, 14 October. Hearings are taking place at the International Dispute Resolution Centre at 1 Paternoster Lane,
London, EC4M 7BQ between 10.30am sharp and 4:30pm with a lunch break between 1pm and 2pm. Post Office has a
private break out room (208) from 9am each day where we can meet prior to the start of the hearing each day.

The team have provided a helpful guidance pack (attached) on the logistics including when and where to meet, a
summary of the running order and dramatis personae of Counsel as well as a helpful Comms guidance note (particular
thanks to the Comms Team). If you would like to attend in person please let Fintan and I know which days you would like
to attend to ensure that arrangements can be made. Presently, in terms of Board and executive directors attendances,
we have:

Tuesday 11" — Inquiry Counsel Opening Statement: Ben Tidswell, Nick Read, Ben Foat, Simon Recaldin and Fintan

Friday 14"*— BEIS, UKGI, FJ, POL Opening — Carla Stent, Nick Read, Al Cameron, Ben Foat, Jeff Smyth, Fintan Canavan

I have reached out to the Retail team so that there is also an executive retail presence during the Postmasters opening
statements.

Proceedings will be livestreamed at YouTube Channel or via the main website
at https://www.postofficehorizoninquiry.org.uk/ for those of you who are not able to attend in person. We will of
course provide updates to board / GE at appropriate times throughout the Inquiry.

Finally, I confirm that our written submissions were filed on time. We are reviewing our oral submissions to address any
material points that arise from other Core Participants’ submissions and I will update board on any such material
amendments.

Please contact me with any queries.

Kind regards,
Ben

I work flexibly — so whilst it suits me to email outside normal working hours, I do not expect a response outside your own.
