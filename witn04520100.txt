POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF BRIAN ARTHUR PINDER

|, MR BRIAN ARTHUR PINDER, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION
1. | am a former employee of Fujitsu Services Limited (“Fujitsu”), having retired in

2018.

2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
(the “Inquiry”) with the matters put to me in a Rule 9 Request dated 7 June 2023
(the “Request”), to the extent | have or had direct knowledge of such matters.
Given the passage of time, | have limited recollection of the topics covered by the
Request. The content of this witness statement therefore focuses largely on the
content of various documents provided to me by the Inquiry. To the extent those
documents have assisted my recollection, | set out the URN of the relevant

document.

3. | was assisted in preparing this statement by Morrison Foerster, the recognised

legal representatives for Fujitsu in the Inquiry.

PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND

4. | joined ICL Sorbus (a Fujitsu group company) in November 1996 as a Security
Administrator, after 22 years in with the Royal Air Force Police. From this time, |
held various non-technical security-focused roles within the Fujitsu group,

including:

a. 1996 to 1998 / 1999: Security Administrator, employed on military sites

working within the Fujitsu team to carry out routine security administrative

duties;

b. 1998 / 1999 to 2003: Site Security Administrator, working within the

Department of Trade and Industry Account; and

c. 2003 to 2005: Security Administrator, working within the Fujitsu Security team

servicing all of Fujitsu’s central government security teams.

5. | joined Fujitsu’s Post Office Account (the “Account”) as a Security Manager in
around 2005 and left the Account in November 2009. After leaving the Account, |
took another role in Fujitsu in the Central Business Continuity team, where |

remained until | retired in 2018.

6. A summary of my (i) qualifications and accreditations, (ii) professional skills and
methodologies, and (iii) professional memberships are set out in Appendix 1 to this

statement.

WITNO04520100

MY POSITIONS DEALING WITH SECURITY

7. As noted above, | became a Security Manager on the Account in 2005, having
been made aware of the role through conversations with other Security Managers
at Fujitsu. | was formally offered the position following interviews with the Security

and Service Managers on the Account at the time.

8. In terms of training and experience, by the time | joined the Account, | had gained
almost 10 years of security administrative experience through my employment with
the various security teams at Fujitsu. | had also gained knowledge of physical,
documentary, personal and IT security, including knowledge of the BS7799

standard, during my time with the RAF.

9. During my time as Security Manager, the Account worked towards compliance with
1S017799. My previous experience within Fujitsu involved co-ordinating (i) central
processes and policies, (ii) security documentation, (iii) awareness, and (iv)
standardisation, across all Fujitsu central government security teams. These teams
were also working within ISO compliance. My experience in these areas was

favourable for the Security Manager role on the Post Office Account.

10.As Security Manager, | performed a wide range of security-related activities that
(i) assisted the establishment and maintenance of an 1SO17799 compliant
infrastructure, (ii) supported legal and contractual obligations, and (iii) minimised
liabilities for the company. | was responsible for monitoring operations and
introducing specific security controls to maintain the integrity, availability and

confidentiality of the information used. This included arranging suitable “Pen

13.

WITNO04520100
WITNO04520100

Testing” with third party providers and managing issues found, in order to provide

a secure solution.

.My role also involved attending security meetings held by the Post Office Limited

(‘Post Office”) Security team to review, discuss and ultimately resolve any areas
of concern with regards to security. | was also involved in (i) the implementation
and maintenance of Fujitsu security policies and procedures, including those
relating to system and physical access controls, and Anti-Virus and malicious
software management, (ii) reporting security incidents, and (iii) problem

management.

In terms of reporting lines, all members of my team reported to me. This included
Peter Sewell (who was my deputy and also the deputy to my predecessor Bill
Mitchell), Andy Dunks, Penny Thomas and Neneh Lowther. Mr Dunks, Ms Thomas
and Ms Lowther also individually reported to Mr Sewell, who worked more closely
with them. As my deputy, Mr Sewell would manage any issues in my absence. |
then reported to the Service Director. | believe Dave Baldwin held this role at a
point, after which | reported to his replacements, although | cannot recall their
names. The role of Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) for the Account
Security team was introduced by the Account at some point during my tenure as
Security Manager, although | do not recall when, maybe around 2007. From that
point forwards, | reported to the CISO (Howard Pritchard), until | left the Account in

November 2009.

In terms of reporting issues or discussing actions to be taken, | conversed with my
team almost daily. From my recollection, | generally only had meetings with Mr

Baldwin and his Service Managers if they requested it.

WITNO04520100
WITNO04520100

14. The Inquiry has asked me to comment on the competence and professionalism of
my colleagues and managers. In this regard, all my staff appeared very competent
in their work and worked hard to provide a good service for Post Office. All other
Account staff who | came into contact with also seemed to be very competent,
aware of their responsibilities, and again worked hard to achieve their goals for the

Account and Post Office.

MY INVOLVEMENT IN PROCEEDINGS AGAINST POSTMASTERS

15. Until reviewing the documents provided to me by Inquiry, | did not recall having any
involvement in Post Office disciplinary matters or proceedings against
postmasters. From the documents | have received, however, | can see that | was
in fact involved, albeit largely as a point of contact for Post Office legal

representatives in respect of certain subpostmaster proceedings.

16.In addition to the documents provided to me by the Inquiry in relation to Post
Office’s proceedings against Mr Lee Castleton, which are addressed in more detail
below, | have also been shown an email exchange between myself, Graham Ward
of Post Office, Gareth Jenkins and Neneh Lowther in relation to proceedings
relating to the Gaerwen branch (FUJ00152587). Unfortunately, however, this has
not assisted my recollection any further. Having reviewed the email exchange, |
believe my involvement would have been purely administrative as Ms Lowther’s

line manager.

17.| have also been asked by the Inquiry in which circumstances | would have had
contact with Mr Ward. | can see from the documents provided to me that Mr Ward

was a casework manager in the POL Investigation team. Beyond what is set out in

Page 5 of 20
18.

19.

20.

WITNO04520100
WITNO04520100

the documents however, | have no recollection of Mr Ward. | would imagine that
any contact | did have with Mr Ward would have been for one-off specific reasons.
In order to help refresh my memory, | have also been provided with the Service
Description for the Security Management Service from March 2006
(FUJ00002000). Mr Ward is noted on the external distribution list for this Service
Description, | presume this was because he worked as a Case Manager for Post

Office.

| do not recall producing or signing any witness statements. Neither do | recall
undertaking the extraction of any audit data. During my tenure as Security
Manager, the extraction of audit data for the Post Office Investigation Team was
generally undertaken by Penny Thomas. This process was carried out from a
secure office which only Ms Thomas had access to. | was not personally aware of
the details of the process, but | am aware that it had to be carried out meticulously
so that the data contained the specific details the investigators required. The audit
data extraction process was in place prior to my arrival on the Account and, as far
as | was aware, was agreed between Fujitsu and the Post Office Investigations
Team as the acceptable process to be followed. | was not notified when Ms
Thomas was requested to extract data, nor did | expect to be provided with details

of such requests.

After the extraction process was complete, Ms Thomas would write a statement

presenting the audit data formally as evidence for the courts.

As far as | was aware, Ms Thomas was always very professional in her work, and

| never received any complaints about her or her work. In circumstances where Ms

Page 6 of 20
WITNO04520100
WITNO04520100

Thomas was away sick or on annual leave, she would have instructed her

colleagues Neneh Lowther or Andy Dunks to cover for her.

2

.To the extent that Ms Thomas was required to present any data obtained to the
court, as her line manager | would be asked if there was an issue with the court
date or whether the distance for her to travel was particularly extensive, but this
was the full extent of my involvement in the process. The process itself appeared
to me to be a straightforward one in that Ms Thomas would simply extract the data

requested and then present that data to the court.

22.The Inquiry has asked me to consider multiple documents in relation to the
provision of witness evidence in proceedings. | unfortunately do not have any
recollection of these documents. As explained further below, my involvement in
such matters would have been minimal or as an intermediary between the parties

involved.

MY INVOLVEMENT IN PROCEEDINGS AGAINST LEE CASTLETON

23.The Inquiry has asked me to consider around [35] documents relating to Post
Office’s proceedings against subpostmaster, Lee Castleton. The URNs for these
documents are listed in the index at the back of this statement. Unfortunately, | do
not have any recollection of the documents provided to me, of the case against Mr
Castleton, or of any other specific case or investigation carried out by the Post
Office. By way of background in this regard, this type of work did not form any part

of my day-to-day role on the Account. It was very much the exception.

24. That being said, | can see from the documents provided that, in the case against

Mr Castleton, | acted as a point of contact for Post Office’s legal representatives,

Page 7 of 20
25.

26.

WITNO04520100
WITNO04520100

Bond Pearce LLP (“Bond Pearce”). As the Security Manager at the time, | was
ideally placed in this regard to facilitate communication between Bond Pearce and
the many and varied colleagues on the Account. The communications provided
appear largely to have related to technical questions or the provision of information.
As with my previous security-related position, my role as Security Manager was
not a technical one and | did not therefore, have the requisite technical knowledge
to respond to Bond Pearce’s questions myself. From the documents provided, my

main contact at Bond Pearce appears to have been Stephen Dilley.

By way of example, the email chain at FUJ00122285 shows me acting as the
liaison between Bond Pearce and Anne Chambers; | am being requested to ask
Mrs Chambers to review her witness statement and respond accordingly. | then
forward the email onto Mrs Chambers, as directed. Similarly, the email chain at
FUJ00122283 shows me acting in the same capacity as intermediary between

Bond Pearce and Gareth Jenkins.

In relation to early discussions of the matter, the Inquiry has referred me to
document POL00071165, a note of a meeting between Post Office, Bond Pearce
and Fujitsu on 6 June 2006. Both myself and Mr Sewell, in addition to Mr Jenkins,
Mrs Chambers, Andy Dunks and Naomi Ellis are recorded as having attended the
meeting on behalf of Fujitsu (although | note that a Naomi Elliot appears on other
documents around this period). | do not recall this meeting but, having reviewed
my comments in the “How Horizon Works” section, | presume | would have
discussed the audit processes with various mainly technical people, including Ms

Thomas and maybe others, ahead of the meeting and then reported my findings

Page 8 of 20
WITNO04520100
WITNO04520100

as shown. | would then have known where to go to find technical people who had

the expertise to answer or explain the exact process if required.

27.With regards to the involvement of Mr Jenkins in the case against Mr Castleton, |
believe that Mr Jenkins was a senior technical person at Fujitsu with good
knowledge of the system. It is for this reason that | would have gone to him to
answer the various questions raised if need be. | would expect Mr Jenkins’
evidence to have been very technical and detailed (see for example

FUJ00122284).

28.| have also been asked about the involvement of Mrs Chambers in this case, but |
have limited recollection of Mrs Chambers or her role within the Account. | believe
she may have become involved in this matter as it concerned a call that she had

dealt with previously.

29.From the documents provided, it appears that a member of my team, Mr Dunks,
was also involved in this matter. Document FUJ00152297, for example,
demonstrates that Mr Dunks had retrieved Fujitsu helpdesk call logs for
proceedings in the past and was offering to do so again. | imagine that the reason
Mr Dunks became involved in this case was because he was in a position that

enabled him to gain access to the relevant call logs.

30.1 have been asked by the Inquiry to consider document FUJ00152290 and explain
why this matter was referred to as a “test case” and the implications of this. | do
not have any specific recollection of this email exchange, but | would presume that
what Graham Ward of Post Office meant by “test case” was that this was the first

case of this nature. On that basis, perhaps identifying someone who might (i) know

Page 9 of 20
31.

32.

WITNO04520100
WITNO04520100

and understand the requirements, where to look for the necessary information and
have the authority to examine those areas of the system, and (ii) be able to
document the information so it could be understood, would have been challenging

and time consuming.

| have also been asked by the Inquiry about my knowledge of the Horizon system's
ability to “lose” transactions, the existence of bugs, errors and defects or any
associated enquiries. In particular, | have been pointed to documents
POL0069404, POL00069835 and POL00069925. As my role was non-technical, |
do not recall having any direct experience of the system's ability to lose
transactions. However, | am aware that this was a very large system / network,
with thousands of terminals, and bugs, errors and defects were and are not
uncommon in any network. This is why IT technicians work on networks day and
night. In relation to the documents provided to me by the Inquiry, | do not have any
specific recollection of these discussions. Document POL00069835 is a further
example of my role as an intermediary between Mr Dilley of Bond Pearce and
technical experts within Fujitsu, whose responses are set out in my emails to

Mr Dilley.

Document POL00070126 is a Bond Pearce attendance note recording a phone
call that | was not a party to. The call seems to relate to an issue with Horizon at
the Falkirk branch and what actions needed to be taken in the case against Mr
Castleton as a result. The end of the note records that Mr Dilley stated he had
spoken with me about the issue and asked me to look into it. The note then records

that | forwarded the email to Mr Sewell. The Inquiry has asked what actions | took

Page 10 of 20
WITNO04520100
WITNO04520100

in response to this discussion. | do not recall this issue but would assume that Mr

Sewell progressed the matter as recorded in the note.

33.Document POL00069806 is an email exchange between myself and Mr Dilley
about (i) the availability of Mr Castleton’s cash declarations, and (ii) the “database”
from which data provided by Fujitsu had been collected. The Inquiry has asked
how | obtained the information set out in my response. Although | do not recall the
email exchange, | believe | would have acquired the information from various
people on the Account, both technical and otherwise, including Mr Sewell and my

own Security team.

34.1 am unable to comment on the content on the evidence provided by my Fujitsu
colleagues itself, as | do not have the technical knowledge or expertise necessary

to do so (nor did | have such knowledge at the relevant time).

35. In relation to how the matter developed after the conclusion of the trial, the Inquiry
has referred me to (i) an email exchange between myself and Mik Peach in relation
to whether an internal review of the case should take place (FUJ00152300), and
(ii) an “Afterthoughts” document prepared by Mrs Chambers (FUJ00152299). |
have no recollection of either of these documents but set out below my current

interpretation.

36. In relation to the email exchange at FUJ00152300, | have been asked by the Inquiry
why | did not consider a “mop up” following the case to be necessary. In the email
exchange with him, my response informs me that | sought advice from technical
people regarding the need for a wash up meeting and my response was the

conclusion of that, (i) as this was a rare occurrence and unusual case, involving

Page 11 of 20
WITNO04520100
WITNO04520100

specific areas, which had not occurred prior and would be highly unlikely to repeat
itself, and (ii) given all the routine procedures, despite being stretched, were
followed and served us well, no wash up meeting was considered necessary from
my perspective as Security Manager. So, provided the areas highlighted by Mrs
Chambers in her “Afterthoughts” document were picked up by those on the email
to the extent they were relevant to their specific areas, | as Security Manager did

not believe any mileage would be gained in holding a wash up meeting.

37.In relation to Mrs Chambers’ “Afterthoughts” document, Mrs Chambers had
obviously highlighted some areas of interest and written up her thoughts in relation
to the case. This document was attached to Mr Peach’s email, which was
addressed to both me and Ms Elliot to review / comment on / follow up on. | also
agreed to discuss the contents of Mrs Chambers’ document with Ms Elliot (Service
Manager) and to keep both Mr Peach and Mrs Chambers informed. | do not recall
any further action beyond this on my part, although it may have been brought up at
further meetings within the Service Management teams. My email would have been
to ensure that the Service Managers were aware. | was not specifically involved in

Customer Service Management.

38.In preparing this statement, | have also been provided with a copy of the transcript
of the evidence provided by Mr Peach to the Inquiry on 16 May 2023 and have the

following observations:

a. on pages 63 and 64 of this transcript, Mr Peach discusses an argument
he had in relation to Mrs Chambers’ participation in the proceedings
against Mr Castleton. | have no recollection of any arguments concerning

the presentation of evidence to court; and

Page 12 of 20
WITNO04520100
WITNO04520100

b. on pages 64 and 65 of the transcript, Mr Peach clarifies that it was not
me who was tasked with presenting data to court, but rather | managed
the team who undertook this exercise. | agree with Mr Peach's
clarification. As described above, the individual who presented extracted
data in any legal proceedings would have been the individual who
extracted the data. This extraction process was undertaken by certain

members of my team but not by myself.

MY RELATIONSHIP WITH POST OFFICE AND BOND PEARCE

39. The Inquiry has asked me to describe the circumstances in which | would have had
contact with Post Office in relation to issues concerning Horizon and who my
relevant contacts at Post Office were. If | ever needed to contact the Post Office,
my contact would have been Sue Lowther, who headed up the Security team. To
the best of my recollection, Ms Lowther was my primary point of contact at Post

Office.

40. Any contact with Ms Lowther would have been for Fujitsu Security-related reasons,
for example during routine meetings with the Post Office Security team, or if there
were technical issues (including software and hardware issues) or risk analysis that
needed to be discussed. These meetings, which | believe were minuted, were held
either bi-monthly or whenever required by Post Office and would be run by Ms
Lowther. At the meetings, Sue Lowther would have a technical advisor who worked
with her and | would often bring along someone who was technically savvy to

answer any queries.

Page 13 of 20
41.In relation to these meetings, | have been provided with the minutes of a Security
Liaison Meeting that took place on 26 June 2008 which was attended by myself,
Ms Lowther and another Post Office employee, Paul Halliden (FUJ00088340).
Having reviewed this document, | believe that Mr Halliden may have been Ms
Lowther's regular technical advisor. In most cases | attended meetings such as this
by myself; however, | can see on this occasion | was joined by others from Fujitsu.
This was likely to have been because there were particular technical issues to

discuss.

42.In order to refresh my memory, | have also been provided with the minutes of a
HNG-X Core Team Security meeting which took place on 25 May 2006
(FUJ00157865) and was attended by myself and Ms Lowther (amongst others).
Whilst | do not recall these meetings specifically, | note the inclusion of Bill
Membery’s name on the attendee list. This has caused me to remember that
Mr Membery accompanied me to meetings with Post Office on a few occasions in

order to provide appropriate technical input.

43. Apart from my interaction with Bond Pearce as a liaison between the solicitors and
other Fujitsu staff members (as detailed above), | do not recall having any other

involvement with Bond Pearce.

44. There are no other matters that | would like to draw to the attention of the Chair.
Statement of Truth

| believe the content of this statement to be true.
