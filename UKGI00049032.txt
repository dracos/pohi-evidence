Hi Lorna

She didn’t explicitly go into the points about whistleblowing. She only mentioned serious concerns,
complaints and governance issues. Henry did allude to being aware and implied he would go to extreme
(legal) lengths to refute any allegations If they were made in the media. She did also say we would follow up
with the formal letter setting out more detail.

Thanks Annie, very helpful to see.

A quick question on your read out for my info- did the sos go into the ground for his dismissal (ie trying to
shut down the whistleblowing investigation and his behaviours)? Or did she just say governance issues?

Thanks,
Lorna

Dear all,
The call took place at 15:45 — sharing a brief read out of what was discussed. Please treat sensitively.

Thank you ever so much for your support over the weekend to prepare SoS. Carl, Megan, and I briefly chatted about
the choreography of sending out the formal letters and that is in hand for later today.

Annie

Readout: Call between SoS and Sir Henry Staunton (27/01/24)

Attendees: SoS, Sir Henry Staunton, Annie Leigh (listening PS)

C SoS informed Sir Henry Staunton (HS) that the government, as sole shareholder, was exercising its power, under
the company’s Articles to remove him as Chair of the Post Office Board.

SoS apologised that the call was coming at short notice due to desire to speak ahead of the media breaking the
story. SoS committed to sending HS a more formal record of the decision in slower time.

i HS noted that he was called by a reporter this morning to comment on the story. He reflected his dismay under the
circumstances.

HS described some of the events over the last four weeks, reflecting that the Post Office as an organisation is
operating in an extremely challenging context.

[SoS asked HS what next steps he would recommend the government take. HS recommended the following key
actions:

Commence a discussion with the CEO asking them to stay through the inquiry and in return exploring the

possibility of good leaver status.

Extensive work to ensure that the culture at the Post Office is overhauled. HS noted he strongly disagrees

with disparaging views of postmasters and called for a more postmaster-centric approach. In particular, HS

suggested an oversight committee chaired by two Postmaster Directors, and explore appointing a third in

the future.

Greater support from UKGI, a view that HS said was shared by other board members; and

An internal person appointed as SID, recommending Andrew Darfoor as a candidate.

C SoS noted that she had received a briefing on the governance issues at the Post Office and that the complaints
against HS are so serious that the government need to intervene.

SoS and HS discussed the comms for his departure and agreed to work together on a simple form of words (AL note -
we have shared something with HS for comment as we speak).

{SoS and HS agreed he would not attend the board meeting on Monday or Tuesday.

[  $0S concluded the call by thanking HS for his service; expressing her displeasure that the media had broken the
story ahead of a lengthier conversation; and noting HS' recommendations for the Post Office going forward.

-Ends-

Y.
Just to confirm to the chain- Mark K now will not run the story until after SoS’ call, and will run it straight after.

This means I have not issued the letter and we revert to plan 1 which is SoS phone call. Will provide a readout
afterwards so Lorna/Carl you can take forward next steps.

Best wishes,

Hi Lorna,

Thanks for looping us in. The Perm Sec is travelling back from Paris this afternoon so he won’t be able to make these
calls. He’s content for you to call the SID and CEO but has asked to see a readout after.

Hi Megan,

Please find attached three letters.
* 1a. A version of the termination letter to issue following a phone call between Henry and the SoS
© 1b. A version of the termination letter to issue in case the SoS doesn’t manage to speak to him.
© 2. A letter to the company secretary at POL informing the company.

1a has been agreed with lawyers previously. 1b adds a little bit more context, and says an official will be in touch in
due course to explain the decision. REDACTION

REDACTION

The address for the letter notifying the company is Rachel Scarrabelotti

CompanySecretaria! “This second letter could be sent by officials if you prefer,
in which case Carl is happy to send.

I'd be very grateful if you could let me know when the call has happened, as I will then call the Senior Independent
Director, and CEO to let them know (unless @Perm SEC (DBT) Gareth would like to?).
Thanks,

Lorna

Morning Carl and Lorna,
UKGI00049032
UKGI00049032

I’m so sorry to interrupt your weekend with an additional ask on the Post Office Chair.

SoS is hoping to call Henry today and I have emailed him to ask to set up a time. If he does not reply, SoS will try to
call his personal phone number to speak over the phone.

If this does not happen, SoS will inform him of the decision via a letter, to be issued at about 4pm today.

@Carl CRESWELL (DBT)_@Gratton, Lorna - UKGI please could you draft us a letter for SoS to issue in case of the
above, and share with me by midday so I can clear it through SpAds and SoS this afternoon? Given the script has
been cleared by yourselves and legal, hopefully this isn’t too onerous of an ask and you can use that as the basis for
the letter.

On media handling, we understand the Mail and Mark Kleinman may already have the story but this is not 100%
confirmed-_@Samuel HERRERA (DBT) is working on updating our comms defensive lines, and @Catriona MACMAHON
(DBT) will helpfully input lines into SoS’ briefing pack for tomorrow morning’s media interview which was already
going ahead with Laura K.

Megan
