Really not sure what he means Mark, but the fact is that any 'information' he has that he thinks is important he should
put forward (via his professional advisor/ Second Sight if he wants) if it has not already been considered. Why has he
not done so? Will speak to you tomorrow about this case but recent dealings we have had have demonstrated that he,
regrettably, believes all kind of untruths. Honestly - it's been quite irrational as I am sure Patrick will agree.

Having said that, we are clearly seeing some desperation now because these people were given expectations by JFSA. I
would not rule out allegations based on "leaked memos" or similar (there will be probably be some that can be wrongly
interpreted as there are in any company). But they can and will be rebutted because the allegations about Horizon are
wrong, pure and simple. And also - why is he saying this now on Twitter, apart from to be nasty and threatening? If he
thinks he has something that affects his conviction, why hasn't he taken it through proper channels? I think he is a CCRC
case so fine, he should challenge his conviction through legal process as we have always said. We have offered to meet
with him and his MP but, even that, he said we were offering to do so before the Second Sight report was published
(WRONG!) etc etc.

I agree - and sorry. I just can't resist sometimes. But this is a wake up call. What could he mean?

I really agree with you Patrick. I wonder if, in future, we might do the necessary Tweeting via the PO
account so you are not subjected to this Mark.

Agree important not to respond to it but really sorry you have to put up with it. It's deeply unpleasant
and designed to be hurtful. But, while he may get to write this stuff, he doesn't get to decide how you
feel about it - have a glass of wine and enjoy your family !

Mark - obviously do not respond to this nasty tweet or indeed any other abuse! I think you might know
that his brother works for Howe and Co (finance director) and is very involved - we have had
correspondence with the brother, the latest of which went from Bond Dickinson.

I do have a concern that Second Sight might be misusing material (odd questioning tonight from Andrew
Verity - all fine, it's more distortion). I am thinking through where it might be coming from so we are
prepared. If Scott Darlington or anyone else has evidence or information that they think is important
they have had rather a long time to declare it.
