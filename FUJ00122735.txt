David,

I've provided in line comments to the document as revisions. I'm happy for this to be passed to POL if
you feel it is appropriate.

The simple answer is that without retrieving the logs everybody is speculating and as discussed this
morning nobody has bothered to ask us for any logs. At this stage it is not at all clear what
transactions are thought to be missing at what time or even in what time period. Analysing logs over a
long period (and I think this is over two or three months) is very, very time consuming. This is NOT
going to happen by Monday.

Does anybody have a copy of Andy's witness statement?
Regards
Gareth
