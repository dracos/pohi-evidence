. SS confirmed that Part One of the Mediator’s Briefing Pack will be uploaded
today (15" May).

. Part One of the Mediator’s Briefing Pack will be discussed at the face-to-face

M046
¢ AP notified the WG that this is a civil case where recovery had been put on hold

pending the outcome of this case through the Scheme. The case is now
approaching the 6 year limitation period. POL therefore needs to serve Court
proceedings to preserve its legal rights. Those proceedings will then be put on
hold (as happened with M006). BD, acting for POL, are in touch with Howe & Co
(who also act for M006).

M073

¢ AP explained the position relating to the Court proceedings. The WG agreed
that this was not a matter for it to be involved in.
