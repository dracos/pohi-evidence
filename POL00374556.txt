Temporary subpostmaster process is very stark compared to this. No assessment made on suitability of person to run the

branch.

Experience very much varies on the type of branch you operate. If the branch is a new model, this is a combination of the touch
points. If you are transferring on a standard SPSO contract because your branch type doesn't fit the model, and you are a non-
ASM managed branch then the interaction is very limited.

NT and some of the objectives to hit the numbers appear to be driving the multitude of people contacting the branch in the
objective to achieve and deliver the numbers. This objective is also driving some decisions to be made outside of policy.

At this stage of the process, we are still in what we need from the agent and aren't even considering what they need from the
partnership/relationship going forward. It’s all about what we want from them rather than what we can do for them.

Because of the subsequent relationship we then have with the subpostmaster in business as usual, we don’t maximise the skill
set of the people we have in the network and what expertise, learning they can bring to us.

Again, this experience is dependent on what type of branch you are. If you fit into the temporary subpostmaster

ALSO.

COMPLEXITY ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE INVOLVED, LACK OF JOIN UP

CONSIDERATION OF LEARNING NEEDS

APPLYING REASONABLENESS TO INDIVIDUALS (IE. SOME TAKE LONGER, NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL)
SPSO CONVERSION - PROBABLY COVERED IN YOUR BRANCH TYPES

WE DON'T TRAIN PEOPLE IN HOW TO RUN A BUSINESS OR OPERATE A SYSTEM UNDER BRANCH PRESURES

ASK FOR A BUSINESS PLAN BUT DON'T REALY USE OR BUILD ON THIS.
BETTER FLEXIBILITY ON APPROACH (IE. NOT ALL TRAINING AT ONCE)

The branch is required to go to the supplier direct. No visibility is given to the types of branches who are experiencing

equipment issues.

Escalation points will also be Area Sales Managers, Post Office personnel, Senior Stakeholders, NBSC, Crown Management and
Paula etc. Once it gets escalated, the issue resolution usually ends up in Dave Hulbert’s area.

Branches going through the Network Transformation Programme and Crown Transformation are project managed. The main
people who get involved here are the FCA, the NCA and RLB. If there are multiple partner branches going through the process
then there is also an implementation manager involved in the process.

There is no clear owner for training. Everybody thinks they own various parts of training. Most are transactional based trainers

and there isn’t a large input from the type of skills that are being trained out.

The way the business operates means that there are inconsistencies in the quality of the communication produced and
everybody thinks they own branch communication. There is no visibility of who is saying what to branches.

The slide just indicates the process for cash. This is high level but represents the complexity of the process, the number of
people involved and the touchpoint with the branch.

The other point is also that the end result depends on the type of branch, and again, the consequences are inconsistent,
depending on branch type.

There is no single view for the branch in terms of what they are being measured against and what the priorities are.
