Our client: Post Office Limited ("Post Office”)

We are writing with regard to the announcement on 10 January 2024 that the Department
for Business and Trade ("DBT”) will be bringing forward legislation to overturn the convictions
of all those convicted in England or Wales on the basis of Post Office evidence given during
the Horizon scandal and allow for the recovery of compensation. DBT will also be engaging
with the Scottish and Northern Irish Administrations in respect of convictions in their
jurisdictions. More details of the announcement made to Parliament can be found at
https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-01-10/debates/3DDD9684-C08D-4ESE-
AF73-CF85839412AB/PostOfficeHorizonScandal.

As you are aware, Post Office and DBT have actively been considering the approach to the
existing so-called "Public Interest" cases in light of this development.

Notwithstanding that the proposed legislation is yet to be enacted, given Mr Hussain has
already had his conviction overturned, DBT has confirmed that he will now be treated as
eligible to claim compensation in the same way as other Claimants whose convictions have
been overturned.

Mr Hussain will now therefore be able to claim interim payments and either accept the
£600,000 DBT Up Front Offer or proceed to a full assessment of his non-pecuniary and
pecuniary claims and receive compensation accordingly. Please do therefore submit an
Interim Payment Application in relation to Mr Hussain.

Post Office hopes this comes as welcome news to Mr Hussain but please let us know if you
have any queries or would like to discuss.

Yours faithfully
