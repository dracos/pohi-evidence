Dear Ben,

In advance of our session with the Perm Sec tomorrow on Post Office, please find attached slides to
be shared with Alex in advance.

These contain more background than we can likely cover in detail in the session, but this will
hopefully be useful for Alex. Our preference would be to focus on slides 3, 4 and 8, but we'd be happy
to discuss any issues in the pack depending on Alex's interests.

Best wishes,
Eleanor
