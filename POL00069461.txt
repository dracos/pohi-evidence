I had a telephone conversation with Ruth Simpson.

She wanted to make a further amendment to paragraph 9(c) of her Statement. Basically,

she explained that she did the cash accounts on Thursdays not Wednesdays and it was the
Thursday that the screen froze. She gave me her home address and asked me to post two
copies of the Statement to her so that she can sign it and get it back to me.

Time engaged : 6 mins.
