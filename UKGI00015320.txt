In the context of Horizon, an early meeting with ICL would particularly awkward at this
stage and therefore could not be productive or serve any very useful purpose. However, as
Keith Todd’s letter indicates, there are wider common interests between the Department
and ICL which the Secretary of State would, in CIl’s view, and find it useful to discuss in
due course.

Thank you for your letter of 24 December.

I should welcome the opportunity of a meeting with you in due course to discuss the range

of issues in which the Department and ICL have a common interest. I would suggest that

your office contact my Diary Secretary,
