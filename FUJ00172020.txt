Graham,

I've revised the update on the issues with ARQ for Forest Gate and Urmston. We are continuing our review of
previous ARQs and should be well placed to discuss this issue at our meeting on the 9" June. The overall cause for
the data being omitted is regretfully and will remain as ‘operator error’, Revised details are below together with an
update as to the root cause.

Forest Gate: This request is split over 3 ARQ, No's 198, 199 & 200

ARQ 198 - The ARQ covers the period 14/10/02 to 13/11/2002, totalling 31 query days. The root cause for the
omission of data from this ARQ is that the retrieval was executed as a single task with the resultant data
retrieval exceeding the available 1Gb limit of the Message Store area on the Audit Server. This forced the
Audit Server to randomly drop 11,135 data entries. A total of 10 days have been affected these dates are:

16/10 - Partial, no end of day

17/10 - Partial, beginning of day missing
19/10 - No data retrieved.

21/10 - Partial, beginning of day missing
22/10 - Partial, no end of day

23/10 - Partial, beginning of day missing
25/10 - Partial, no end of day

26/10 - No data retrieved

29/10 - No data retrieved

30/10 - Partial, beginning of day missing

ARQ 199: The ARQ covers the period 14/11/02 to 11/12/2002, totalling 28 query days. The root cause for the
omission of data from this ARQ is when an ARQ is retrieved it is necessary to add additional days to the end
of the requested date span to ensure a full and complete capture of the data which may have been harvested
at different times. The operator should then confirm that an end of day log off is present and extract only the
required data files. In this case the operator added two additional days to each ARQ, which is normally
sufficient, but it appears did not confirm that an end of day log off was present, consequently an additional 235
data entries were not included in the data extraction. The affected dates are:

ARQ 198 - 27/11/2002 - Partial, no end of day \

ARQ 200: The’ARQ covers the period 12/12/2002 to 08/01/2003, totalling 28 query days. The root cause for
the omission of data from this ARQ was the same as ARQ 199 above and 679 additional data entries were not
included in the data extraction. The affected dates are:

ARQ 200 - 03/01/2003 - Partial, no end of day

We are currently repeating the exercise to extract the ARQ for Forest Gate and these will be forward as soon
as is practicable.

Urmston: This request equates to ARQ 320 only
ARQ 320: The ARQ covers the period 03/01/2003, totalling 1 query days. The root cause for the omission of
data from this ARQ was the same as. ARQ 199 and 200 above and 796 additional 796 entries were not
included in the data extraction. The affected dates are:
ARQ 320 - 03/01/2003 - Partial, no end of day

The extraction of data for Rumson has already been repeated and dispatched to you. This ARQ is now
correct and only requires an additional statement to complete the task.

In addition to the above we have checked the following other ARQs for which statements have been requested. No
discrepancies have been found

Ashford - ARQ 213 - 215

Borehamwood - ARQ 155 - 159, 201, 259 - 262, 278 - 281, 346 - 349
