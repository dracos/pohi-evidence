Hi Angela. At this stage | mean the scheme process. Although the stakeholder environment might be relevant. My point
is, for SS to go before the scheme has completed, what would enable them to do so and say that there is no risk to the
scheme because PO is able to take on their role?

My train is late this morning but if any help | should be in around 8 and can have a chat.

Best wishes

Belinda

Belinda,

What do you mean by ‘specific issues'? Do you mean touch points in the investigation process and/or the Scheme
process? Or are you referring to the stakeholder environment?

Angela

| said | would do a note about how to move to a place where Second Sight are able to leave the Working Group and
allow Post Office take over sole responsibility for the investigations?

Are there any specific issues that Second Sight must be in place before Post Office could take over from them.

And if so, are they in place now or do we have a date for when are they likely to be?

Best wishes

Belinda
