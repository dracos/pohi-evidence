POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF PETER JAMES COPPING

|, PETER JAMES COPPING, will say as follows in response to Request for information
pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006 — Request number 1 dated 15 June 2022,

regarding matters falling within Phase 2 of the Inquiry.

PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND

1. The Inquiry has asked me to set out a brief professional background. | ama
Chartered Engineer and Fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology. |
was employed as an engineer in the electronics and telecommunications industry
between 1965 and 1976. In 1976 | joined PA Consulting, where | undertook a wide
range of Telecommunications and Information Technology projects for clients. |
was a director of PA Consulting Group and Managing Partner of the Global IT

Consulting Practice from 1990 until | retired June 2000.

BACKGROUND TO INVOLVEMENT IN THE HORIZON PROJECT

2. The Inquiry has asked me to set out the background to my involvement in the
Horizon project. My involvement in Horizon was part-time, commencing in

September 1997. My involvement ended in September 1999.

HORIZON PROCUREMENT STAGE

3. The Inquiry has asked me about my involvement in the procurement stage of the
BA/POCL Automation Programme and the suitability of ICL Pathway’s proposed

technical solution.

4. | have reviewed POL00038844 [WITN0397_01/1 ] dated 1t September 1995. |
note that PA Consulting is mentioned twice, a) in the context of a planned project
review during October 1995 and b) a report on Testing Strategy. | was not involved
with the procurement stage of the BA/POCL Automation Programme or these two
PA Consulting assignments, so | am not able to answer questions about these

aspects of Horizon.

PA CONSULTING REVIEW OF HORIZON — AUGUST/ DECEMBER 1997

5. The Inquiry has asked me to describe the nature of my involvement in the review of

the Horizon Project which was commissioned in/around July 1997.

WITN03970100
WITN03970100

| have reviewed POL00028092 [WITN0397_01/2] dated 1S October 1997. This
folder contains two numbered POCL copies of my 1997 review of Horizon. This
report was commissioned by Alec Wylie, Chief Executive of the SSA (NI) on behalf
of the participants, BA, POCL and ICL Pathway. The purpose of the review was to
identify reasons for the delays and recommend actions to de-risk the project to

bring it back on track.

Also included in POL00028092 is a PA Consulting report to POCL dated June

1998. As my review of Horizon was conducted during August and September 1997
this report is not relevant so | will not be referring to it in answering questions about
the 1997 PA Review. | was not involved in the June 1998 report, so | am unable to

answer questions about the content of that report.

The 1997 PA review of Horizon involved a series of in-depth interviews and follow-
up investigative meetings with each participant at CEO level and below, the aim
being to understand the business objectives of each party, the contractual
arrangements, the programme management processes, and the technical
infrastructure proposed for Horizon by ICL Pathway and, the reasons for the

delays.

| personally undertook over thirty face-to-face interviews and investigative
meetings; some in-depth technical interviews were attended by PA specialists. A
significant amount of documentation regarding the technology, status and plans for

Horizon was reviewed.

Page 3 of 22
WITN03970100
WITN03970100

10.1 concluded that Horizon was world class in its ambitions. The technical

11.

infrastructure proposed, although containing proprietary components and requiring
bespoke software development, | judged to be achievable. The detailed
specifications for Horizon were to be determined after the contract was placed. The
terminology for this unusual contractual arrangement for a PFI was ‘Agreements to
Agree’ and ICL Pathway told me they had seriously underestimated the extent of
development work required. There would continue to be uncertainty about delivery
until all the ‘Agreements to Agree’ were signed off by the parties. This process was

a significant cause of initial delays to the programme.

| found fundamental structural problems; the business cases of the three
participants were marginal and their business objectives were in conflict. | found no
evidence that POCL was taking serious steps to ready the business to accept
Horizon into the Branch Network. Their focus was on planning, not implementing;
POCL faced a major challenge to get ready in time to accept Horizon into the
business. The ability of ICL Pathway to secure, manage and retain the skilled
resources required to finalise the detailed specifications with BA and POCL would
be critical to future timescales. The programme would take longer to implement
than first estimated so costs would increase. The Programme Delivery Authority
(PDA) was cumbersome and should be reduced significantly in size. It was clear
that many issues would be better managed directly between one of the sponsors
and ICL Pathway. | concluded there was no sensible way of descoping or radically

altering the plan, it was better to continue than to terminate.

WITN03970100
WITN03970100

12.My report identified tactical changes required to strengthen Programme
Management and which should be taken forward by the PDA. | also identified
strategic risks to the programme which needed further evaluation as their resolution
would impact the future of the PO Network and delivery of social welfare payments

and therefore was likely to require the active sponsorship of Ministers.

13.1 presented my report to the BA/POCL PDA on 24" September 1997
(POL00028447 [WITN0397_01/3] records this meeting) and subsequently to a
Special PDA Board Meeting on 2"4 Oct 1997 (POL00028325 [WITN0397_01/4]
records this meeting). The second meeting agreed that four workshops should be
organised to establish a common understanding between the parties of the
Strategic Risks and the resolution options available. | facilitated these Workshops,

the first of which took place on 23/4 October 1997.

14.1 have reviewed POL00028096 [WITN0O397_01/5] dated 21s November 1997 which
records a mid-point meeting on 20" November. | attended this meeting at which
the progress on actions from the first Workshop were reviewed and further work in
preparation for Workshop 2 was agreed. | confirm that | was asked to lead the team
delegated to develop a reconstruction plan for the project for the parties to consider

at this Workshop.

15.1 have no recollection of the remaining workshop activities or indeed, whether they

took place.

HM TREASURY REVIEW, JUNE/JULY 1998 (MONTAGUE REVIEW)

16. The Inquiry has asked me to describe the nature of my involvement in the Treasury
Review of the Horizon project, which was commissioned in Spring 1998. The
Treasury Task Force led by Adrian Montague, was asked to conduct a further
review of Horizon as the project continued to experience delays. | understood the
purpose of this review was to present options to Ministers for a decision on the

future of the Horizon programme.

17.1 have reviewed FUJ00075720 [WITN0397_01/6] dated 28" May 1998, an ICL
Pathway Memorandum which records the questions asked of ICL Pathway at ICL
Pathway’s first presentation to the Panel on 28th May 1998. This record confirms |
attended this presentation but that other members of the panel, less familiar with

the programme, asked most of the questions.

18.1 undertook several investigations for the Panel involving meetings and one to one
discussions with ICL Pathway, BA and POCL. | remember that | was asked for
assessments regarding the extent to which Horizon was ‘future-proofed’, whether it
had the capability to support Electronic Point of Sale (EPOSS), whether it could be
developed to support simple banking applications, the likely lifetime of the
technology and, whether it was a technology suitable for longer term government

infrastructure. My overall view on Horizon technology was positive, it could support

Page 6 of 22
WITN03970100
WITN03970100

more applications than just the Benefit Card, however there remained considerable

uncertainty about the timing of delivery.

19.BA was concerned about the impact of programme slippage on their business case
for the Benefit Card. | was told their longer-term aim was to move most benefit
payments to Automated Cash Transfer (ACT) and they wanted to understand
whether Horizon might support Benefit Encashment for claimants without a bank
account. BA had developed serious concerns about the ability of POCL to take on

Horizon.

20.1 do not recall being asked to enquire about the parties knowledge of technical

faults and defects in the Horizon system during this review.

21.It is likely that | submitted working papers to the Task Force on the topics | was
asked to investigate but have no records that might have helped me recall more
detail. That said, given the extent of my engagement with each of the parties over
several weeks | believe that | would have been properly informed and that the

assessments | made for the Panel were accurate at the time.

22.1 was present at an interim presentation made by the Task Force to the No.10
Policy Unit and subsequently an Interdepartmental Working Group. | recall the
main conclusions of my 1997 review were confirmed and the following additional
points were made:

e The BA was taking an aggressive contractual stance (Business case for Benefit
Card vs lower cost alternatives e.g., ACT)

Page 7 of 22
WITN03970100
WITN03970100

e POCL were positioning Horizon as fundamental to its future survival (but they
had yet to develop the business strategy)

e ICL was losing money and seeking a contract extension.

23.1 recall that the conclusion of the Task Force review was that timescale slippage
was preferable to either termination or minor reconstruction (e.g., management
changes). | recall the broad framework for the reconstruction proposed would be a
contract extension to give POCL more time to prepare the business for Horizon,
removal of the Benefit Card from the critical path, ICL developing a simple Horizon
banking application for benefit encashment on an interim basis (i.e., pre-ACT),

proper empowerment of Horizon Programme Office by moving it to POCL.

24. The financial implications for each party were not in the terms of the Treasury
Review. | believe the conclusions were presented to the Interdepartmental Working

Group and to Ministers. | do not know if a formal report was written.

PUBLIC SECTOR NEGOTIATIONS WITH ICL PATHWAY — SEPTEMBER/

OCTOBER 1998

25. The Inquiry has asked me to describe the nature of my involvement in the public
sector negotiations with ICL Pathway over the future of the Horizon project. The
Government appointed Graham Corbett as an Independent Advisor/troubleshooter
to advise Ministers on whether the framework suggested by the Treasury Task

Force/Montague Review could provide a commercial basis for continuing and

Page 8 of 22
WITN03970100
WITN03970100

whether the parties could develop a robust implementation plan to complete the

project.

26.1 joined the Independent Advisor's Working Group on a part-time basis to liaise with
the parties as they answered numerous questions posed by the Advisor and to
provide an assessment of any risks arising from such a reconstruction. KPMG were
retained to advise on the commercial aspects; | did not have any visibility of this

process.

27.1 have reviewed POL00028500 [WITN0397_01/7] dated 28' October 1998 titled
the ‘Acceptance Paradigm’. | cannot comment on the content as | have no
recollection of this discussion. | do not recall ever having given advice concerning

the conditions for Acceptance of the Horizon system.

28.1 have reviewed POL00028098 [WITN0397_01/8] dated 16" October 1998, the
Advisor's report to the Treasury Chief Secretary, which | had not previously seen.
My advice concerning programme and project management issues in the Autumn

of 1998 is summarised in an Annex to this report.

29.1 identified a critical risk -failure to complete Acceptance in planned timescales.
This could cause one or more of the parties to resort to legal action and stop the
programme. In addition, two major risks were identified (delay to go-live for
NR2/benefit card roll out and delay to POCL service management). Finally, there

were two minor risks, the speed of the testing/acceptance process and unforeseen

WITN03970100
WITN03970100

issues during rol-out. The parties had considered how to mitigate these risks and

their revised Horizon Critical Path plan was also included in the Annex.

| note that the Advisor informed Ministers that he failed to facilitate Agreement
between the parties. | was not aware of this at the time. | was not involved with
Horizon from October 1998 until late Spring 1999, when | was contacted by a

Treasury representative wanting to discuss my further involvement.

.March-April 1999. | was informed that a senior Treasury official (Steve Robson)

had been appointed by the Government to conclude negotiations with the parties.
My involvement in this process was required, would be on-demand and involve
attendance at some meetings with BA, POCL and ICL Pathway and possibly some
telephone enquiries from Steve Robson and other Treasury officials assigned to

the negotiations.

| have reviewed HMT00000010 [WITN0397_01/9] dated 5" March 1999 and note
that it records an intent by the author, Peter Schofield, to discuss with me the

commercial envelope within which ICL would be operating. | recall having several
contacts with Peter Scofield as he was my main interface with the Treasury during

this process however, | have no recollection of any details of these conversations.

.In meetings with BA, ICL Pathway and POCL | observed and took part in

discussions by the parties about the revised framework, critical path issues and

how the programme should be rescheduled. There were many discussions about

Page 10 of 22
WITN03970100
WITN03970100

the options for implementing a banking application and, how the Benefit Card
should be withdrawn from the Live Trial configuration of Horizon. | was not involved

in any commercial or contractual matters or negotiations.

ACCEPTANCE OF THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM

34. The Inquiry has asked me to describe the nature of my involvement in the
acceptance of the Horizon IT system. | have reviewed document FUJ00079116
[WITN0397_01/10] dated 24" May 1999, which confirms agreement had been
reached on certain material amendments to the contract. | had not previously seen
this document. | note that it commits the parties to develop a codified agreement
and nominates me as the independent expert should they fail to reach agreement
on any issues of a programme or technical nature. | do not have any recollection of
being asked to arbitrate on any technical or programme disagreements. | have
never seen the Codified Agreement or a revised contract between POCL and ICL

Pathway.

35.In mid-June 1999, | was appointed on a part-time basis by POCL for this stage of

my involvement in Horizon.

36.1 do not recall having ever given advice about the conditions for acceptance of
Horizon in this final stage of my involvement with Horizon. My understanding at the

time was that the parties had agreed — presumably as part of the detailed

Page 11 of 22
WITN03970100
WITN03970100

codification and contract amendments — that Horizon Acceptance would be based
on there being no more than ten medium severity Acceptance Incidents (Als) in the
Live Trial, each of which should have agreed resolution plans. Around this time
there were three Als in dispute, 376, 298 and 218. | comment further on the
process for resolving these Als and, my high-level understanding of their impact in

the following paragraphs.

37.1 have reviewed FUJ00079150 [WITN0397_01/11] dated 16! July 1999 which
details a three-stage process for resolution of Acceptance Incident disputes. | had
not previously seen this document; however, my recollection is that this plan was

used as the basis for progressing and escalating Acceptance Incidents.

38.1 have reviewed FUJ00000485 [WITN0397_01/12] dated 20" August 1999, a
Supplemental Agreement (POCL & ICL Pathway) Change Control Notice 550. |
had not previously seen this document which details how the parties intended to
resolve Acceptance disputes. The document sets out the timetable for resolving
outstanding Acceptance Incidents involving seven workshops between 16" August
and 17 September 1999 and includes my appointment as an expert ‘to act as a
facilitator and advisor to the parties in their efforts to achieve resolution of
outstanding issues”. In the absence of any agreement between them, the parties
could “request the expert to determine the status of an unagreed fault”. | do not
recall either party exercising this option in respect of either a disputed fault
category or resolution timescale. | can confirm that | attended all seven workshops

and the concluding senior management resolution meeting.

Page 12 of 22
WITN03970100
WITN03970100

39.1 have reviewed POL00028332 [WITN0397_01/13] dated 12% August 1999. This
document confirms that POCL intended to refer Al 369 to me, asking whether it
was my opinion this was an incident and its severity. | have no recollection of any
such referral.

40.1 have reviewed POL00028355 [WITN0397_01/14] dated 13" August 1999, the
Acceptance Incident hotlist. This hotlist was used as the agenda to process
disputed Acceptance Incidents through the seven workshops. Prior to
commencement of the workshops, | received briefings from each party’s

perspective on the status of these Als.

41.Concerning the disputed Acceptance Incidents my recollection is as follows:

e AI 376.1 understood that the main symptom of this issue was intermittent
failures in reconciliation of cash accounts, the root cause being a lack of
integrity in data transfers between POCL and ICL Pathway systems.

e Al 298. | understood this issue to be about system instability, causing system
outages and system busy incidents at the counter.

e Al 218. This issue concerned the effectiveness of ICL Pathway training

workshops for Horizon users.

42.| have reviewed FUJ00079169 [WITN0397_01/15] dated 23rd August 1999

regarding the Resolution Proposal for Al 218. | recall that Al 218 was resolved

during the Acceptance Workshops.

Page 13 of 22
WITN03970100
WITN03970100

43.1 have reviewed POL00028470 [WITN0397_01/16] dated 2"¢ September 1999,
notes of action points from Acceptance Workshop 3, specifically regarding Al 314. |
do not recall ever having been asked to review the document referred to ‘Provision
of technical information version 0.2 of CS/SPE/007’. | am therefore unable to

answer questions about this document.

44.1 have reviewed POL00028466 [WITN0397_01/17] dated 4° September 1999
regarding the resolutions proposed for Al 376. Para 5.3 of this document states
that resolution could not be completed before 31* Dec.1999. My recollection is that
problems with this Incident continued, and a resolution plan was not agreed in
subsequent Workshops. My recollection is that this Al was escalated because of

the protracted timetable for resolution.

45.1 have reviewed POL00028467 [WITN0397_01/18] dated 8" September 1999
regarding Acceptance Proposal for Al 412. | am unable to comment on this

document.

46.1 have reviewed POL00028464 [WITN0397_01/19] dated 10" September 1999
regarding the Resolution plan for Al 298. | recollect that the dispute about the

severity of this Al was not resolved during the series of workshops.

47.| have reviewed FUJ00079176 [WITN0397_01/20] dated 17" Sept. 1999 — action

points from Workshop 7 — which confirms Al 298 was to be escalated to Dave

Page 14 of 22
WITN03970100
WITN03970100

Miller (POCL) and Richard Christou (ICL/Fujitsu). The Action list from Workshop 7
also records there were actions outstanding on Al 376 and | recall this Al was also
escalated. | attended the Miller/Christou meeting following Workshop 7 at which
these disputed Als were discussed. | recollect that the parties failed to find a
solution at this meeting and agreed that further staff work was necessary on the
Resolution Plans for these Als. | believe this work proposed ‘tweaks’ to Acceptance
Criteria which | understood led to POCL agreeing that the severity level of each Al
could be reduced from H (high) to M (medium). | was not involved with this staff

work, and | do not recall any of the detail of these agreements.

48.1 have reviewed FUJ00079173 [WITNO397_01/21] dated 16° September 1999
regarding the agreed closure plan for Al 372. | note this document is addressed to
me; however, this was probably for information as it would have made no sense for

me to be asked to comment on an already agreed closure plan.

HORIZON HELPDESK STUDY

49. The Inquiry has asked me several questions regarding the Horizon Helpdesk study,
including what (if any) involvement I had in the study itself. | have reviewed
POL00039808 [WITN0397_01/22] which | have not previously seen. | was not
involved in this assignment or report, so | am not able to answer questions on this

document.

Page 15 of 22
WITN03970100
WITN03970100

50. The Inquiry has asked me at what point did | cease to be involved in matters

5

related to the Horizon system. In late September 1999, | was informed that POCL

had approved Horizon for National roll out and my involvement in Horizon ended.

. The Inquiry has asked if | felt | was properly informed about the nature and extent

of faults in the Horizon system during my period of involvement. | believe | was
properly informed by the parties at each stage of my involvement about the nature
and extent of known issues in Horizon. My role was such that | had unrestricted
access to individuals at all levels in the project. | reviewed a significant volume of
documentation, undertook many interviews and meetings with representatives of

each party.

52. The Inquiry has asked if | have any concerns about the Horizon system after the

period of my involvement. My assumption was that POCL, in direct control of the
programme, were sufficiently aware of all Horizon issues and residual risks and
able to organise and manage the programme accordingly. It now seems possible
that POCL assumed new risk post-Acceptance when they found the basis on which
they agreed that the two key disputed Als (298, 376) could be Medium Severity.
This agreement was significant for both parties as it enabled the timely Acceptance
of Horizon and roll-out. Significantly, it avoided the possibility of a major contractual
fallout. | cannot say whether POCL took specific action to mitigate any risks arising

from this agreement.

Page 16 of 22
WITN03970100
WITN03970100

53. The Inquiry has asked me, looking back, do | feel that the Post Office effectively
scrutinised the technical integrity and robustness of Horizon prior to its acceptance
and roll out. | think most organisations would have been severely tested by the
Horizon proposal from ICL. The provision of a magnetic stripe card to enable
benefit encashment at PO Branches was simple in concept, but the underlying
complexity to achieve this was huge. Nothing of this type and scale had been
attempted elsewhere. The infrastructure proposed by ICL was based on many
different component parts from specialist vendors. Having won the contract ICL
Pathway was established to provide systems integration, software development,
testing, roll-out and, operational systems support. ICL soon admitted they had
seriously underestimated the costs of developing Horizon. As an example, the
requirements to transfer data between BA and POCL computing systems and, the
security requirements of the BA only became clear during the detailed design
stage. The Post Office had no real experience or capability in complex systems
implementation or branch network automation. The ability of the Post Office to
recruit the technical people to work on the project was severely limited and the
uncertainty created by the absence of any agreement with Government on POCL
business strategy meant POCL were often unable to respond with certainty on
many technical and operational issues as the programme proceeded. Given these
constraints | believe the Post Office did their best to effectively scrutinise the

technical integrity and robustness of Horizon, pre-Acceptance.

OTHER MATTERS

54. The Inquiry has asked if there are any other matters which | consider will assist the

Chair. There are no other matters | wish to bring to the attention of the Chair.
