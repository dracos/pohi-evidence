Dear Sirs

The Post Office Group Litigation
Known Error Log

We refer to your third letter of 13 September 2017 which sought confirmation by 5pm today that Post
Office will provide inspection of the Known Error Log.

Post Office are currently discussing with Fujitsu how to enable access to the Known Error Log. We are
hopeful that we shall be in a position to provide a constructive proposal which would be acceptable to the
Claimants by Wednesday, 20 September 2017.

In the interests of avoiding wasted time and costs, please restrain from issuing an application under
CPR31.14 until Post Office has provided its proposal and this has been discussed between the parties.

Yours faithfully

ond Dickingn Up
