Dear Gavin

As discussed, I was in touch with Counsel’s Clerk to talk about likely next steps and he offered during that conversation
to put it under the QC’s nose. The attached reflects his suggestions in tracked changes, received in the last 10 mins. He
said that none were crucial but were designed to create as much flexibility for us as poss [in the unlikely event of a
future challenge].

Best wishes

_Patrick
