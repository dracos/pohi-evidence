TECHNOLOGY & POOO/7
INFORMATION SYSTEMS
IN THE POST OFFICE
POB(00}4
) Across The Post Office the number of information

systems being deployed was considerable with
individual businesses developing their own systems
with little technical commonality. For example,
within the finance function nine separate systems

existed
(if) The majority of Post Office systems were:

- functional rather than process based applications;

- duplicated functionality across business applications;
- created many point solutions;

- reactive rather than proactive with regard to business

needs; and
- lacked global visibility to world class suppliers and

customers.

(iil) The current situation meant it was costly for Business
Units to maintain and upgrade individual instances of
SAP, made exploitation of investment in the technical
infrastructure difficult and worked against the
integration of systems and exploitation of information.

{iv) The Post Office Enterprise Model was fundamental to
the development of The Post Office 1S Strategy,
providing as it did a blueprint for the integration of
information systems across The Post Office. An
essential element of the strategy was the delivery of
core back office functionality, such as finance and HR
systems, which when established would enable the
delivery of a wider set of business applications.
However, the ultimate requirement was to have a
system which provided customers with value,
performance and timeliness.

(vy) The strategy comprised of these design principles:
- 1S systems should be organisationally independent;
- processes should be harmonised;

- generic access channels should be developed for
customers, for use by all businesses (SPICE);

- industry standard software would be used wherever
possible;

- the overall architecture should reduce the complexity
of systems interfaces,

- information about key business entities to be
managed as a group wide asset; and

- operate a consistent information security policy.
noted further that

(vi) The Post Office used 50,000 computers and had one
of the biggest mainframes in the UK;

(vii) Outsourcing had previously been contemplated, but
was not considered appropriate. This mirrored the
approach of a number of major companies. Where
appropriate a number of relationships with external
suppliers, such as Fi, were being developed.

(viii) it was important that as The Post Office developed an
business strategy that it was compatible with that of it

main IS strategy.

(x) Seeking work for third party customers was not
something The Post Office was looking to develop.

HORIZON PROGRAMME
POB(00)7x

(i) The rollout of Horizon was due to recommence on 24
January. A great deal of work had been undertaken to
rectify difficulties identified in three areas:

- system stability;
- accounting integrity; and
- the provision of support to offices

Although as yet uncertain, it was anticipated that these
issues would not prevent rollout recommencing.

@ Financial performance was being monitored against the
revised budget.

(iii) Given that the programme was expected to
recommence rollout, it would be helpful for the Board to
understand what marketing opportunities were now
being considered.

Action

Stuart Sweetman The March Board to review the current status of
marketing for the programme, together with an update
of the financial position of the programme.

The next meeting was scheduled for 14 March 2000.
