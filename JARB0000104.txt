mine were affected (so far as I know ~ there could have been more) and one is a participant

had great faith and hopes that the scheme would serve all participants well: it would provide
redress for those individuals who believe they have been wrongly accused, and sometimes
convicted, of false accounting and fraud and it would offer the Post Office the Opportunity
