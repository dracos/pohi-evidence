I attach a report from the defence expert where he has highlighted a number
of problems with the Horizon system. Our barrister, Warwick Tatford has
asked that the problemswith Horizon that he has raised in his report are
replied to in a witness statement form. I presume that an employee of
fujitsu would have to produce the witness statement.
