Dear Peter

Thank you for your letter dated 9 April 1999.

T understand that Val Curran telephoned Dave Miller and confirmed that
BA CAPs will not enter Live Trial without another round of MOT and E2E
testing.

Both the Post Office and ICL Pathway are satisfied that the results of the
testing undertaken so far enable us to go with confidence into Live Trial.
POCL based its view on an exhaustive process involving all significant
stakeholders within the Post Office domain.

Iam sorry but I am not prepared to accede to your request for another run of
E2E and MOT because this would be a repetitive and time consuming
reinforcement of what we already know.

There seems little scope to reconcile these positions by replaying arguments
that have already been extensively exposed. The present arrangements
around migration can be maintained for a short while, but we will need BA’s
active co-operation from 10 May. Given Hamish Sandison’s advice on

Live Trial, as sent to Dave Miller on Friday 16 April and copied to

Vince Gaskell, refusal to proceed with Live Trial could have significant
implications for BA.
