1. Introduction and Scope

1.1 ISMS Manual Overview

This Information Security Management System (ISMS) Manual supports the Fujitsu Post Office
Account Information Security Policy in describing the overall strategy for providing Information
Security and is based upon security practice as defined by ISO/IEC 27001:2005.

It should be noted that achieving ISO/IEC 27001:2005 certification or indeed Compliance is not a
contractual deliverable but as both Post Office Limited (POL) and Fujitsu recognise the benefits
that adherence to the Standard brings the overarching principles will underpin the Fujitsu Post
Office Account Information Security approach.

Section 5 of this document sets out the Executive Information Security Policy Statement for the
Post Office Account which, together with the Framework of Controls in sections 6 to 15 satisfy
the Contractual requirements.

1.2 Scope

1.2.1 Statement of Scope

This ISMS covers activities undertaken by the Account in the provision of contracted services to
POL including design, development, deployment, operation and support of services, as well as
the programme management, stakeholder management, governance and administrative
procedures applied by executive management to oversee those services.

This ISMS Manual document describes the overall strategy for providing Information Security
and is based upon best practice as defined by ISO/IEC27001:2005.

The actual scope of the Services provided to POL, and which is addressed in complying with
1$O27001:2005, covers the operation and maintenance of the Post Office Account (POA) on-
shore and off-shore services.

The scope also incorporates the assets of the service provided by Fujitsu; especially in regards
to the secure acquisition, handling, processing, storage, transmission and communication of
POL Transaction and Client Data, Personal Identifiable Information, POL Financial Information,
POA and POL Management Information, Audit Data and Operational Data.

1.2.2 Exclusions

Information security risks within POL and their agents’ sites that are outside of the scope of the
Services provided by the Account are excluded from the scope of the POA ISMS.

Services provided by Fujitsu's Global Delivery Centre (GDC) are mentioned within this ISMS
Manual but it should be recognised that GDC hold independent ISO/IEC 27001:2005
Certification. This is accepted by the POA and their local implementation is not further expanded
upon.

1.2.3. Statement of Applicability

The POA shall implement and maintain a Statement of Applicability which will capture the
Controls in place to support the ISMS. It shall also specifically state what ISO/IEC 27001:2005
Controls are out of scope and include a justification for their exclusion.

Information Security Management

Information Security Definition

Information is an asset, which, like other important business assets, has value to an organisation
and consequently needs to be suitably protected. Information Security protects information from
a wide range of threats in order to safeguard customers and staff, ensure business continuity,
minimise business damage and maximise operational efficiency.

Information can exist in many forms. It can be printed or written on paper, stored electronically,
transmitted by post or using electronic means, shown on films, or spoken in conversation.
Whatever forms the information takes, or means by which it is shared or stored, it should always
be appropriately protected and is subject to the provisions of this policy document.

Information Security is characterised here as the preservation of:

e Confidentiality: ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorised to have
access;

e Integrity: safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing
methods;

e Availability. ensuring that authorised users have access to information and associated
assets when required.

Information Security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of countermeasures, including
policies, practices, procedures, organisational structures and technical measures.

Therefore, an associated document suite - the Information Security Management System (ISMS)
has been created to provide for a systematic approach to managing sensitive company
information so that it remains secure. It also encompasses people, processes and IT systems.

ISMS Operating Procedures

Introduction

ISMS Operating Procedures are written descriptions of the management processes and activities
necessary to plan operate and control the ISMS.

PCDA Model

The POA HNG-X Account adopts the Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA) process approach for
Information Security management as presented in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 which promotes:

e Understanding an organization’s Information Security requirements and the need to
establish policy and objectives for Information Security.

e Implementing and operating controls to manage an organization's Information Security
risks in the context of the organization's overall business risks.

e Monitoring and reviewing the performance and effectiveness of the ISMS.

e Continual improvement based on objective measurement.

FUJITSU RESTRICTED
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

The cyclic Information Security lifecycle offers reoccurring opportunities for continuous
improvements to the ISMS. New opportunities for improvement to reduce a new or previously
identified risk can come from a variety of sources including, but not limited to,

e Audit findings

e Information Security reviews

e Information Security incidents

e Change in industry best practise advice
e Technology change

e Environment change

When the requirement for a new or a significant change to existing, policy / process / procedure
etc is identified an Information Security Risk may be added to the Information Security Risk
Register to identify the level of risk that the POA and / or POL is exposed to.

The QMSR and / or the ISMF shall be the forums for any proposed changes:

« To the Information Security Management System that may have an impact on the
Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability of the Services or POL data.

¢ To the documentation within the ISMS Framework.

2.2.2.2 Do

On appropriate approval the CISO is to instigate the implementation of the Controls as identified
in the Risk Treatment Plan.

The CISO is to determine the most appropriate mechanism to communicate the Control change
to all members of staff. Options to be considered include, but are not limited to,

e Email bulletin

e Sharepoint

» Notice Boards

e Workshops

e Internal training sessions
* Other (as identified)

2.2.2.3 Check

Whilst it is expected that all Information Security Controls will be monitored and reviewed,
particular attention should be given to newly introduced Controls to assess whether they are
performing as intended in reducing Information Security risk levels.

The POA is also subject to a variety of external and internal Fujitsu Audits and therefore a
specific Account internal Information Security audit programme is considered to be superfluous
as it is anticipated that all requirements will be met in customer / internal Fujitsu driven activities.

2.2.2.4 Act

The Statement of Applicability is to be adjusted accordingly and the document management
control updated.

The ISMS change is to be formally communicated to all staff and all interested parties with an
appropriate level detail according to each circumstance.

All lessons learnt shall be captured and any improvement principles that can be applied to any
other preventative or corrective actions should be extended across the ISMS.

2.2.3. Management Review of ISMS

The CISO shall ensure that the ISMS is reviewed at planned intervals (at least annually to
ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness.

This review shall include assessing opportunities for improvement and the need for changes to
the ISMS, including the Information Security policy and Information Security objectives.

2.2.3.1 Review Inputs
The review shall consider
e Results of ISMS Audits (External and Internal)
e Major Information Security Incidents
e Status of Information Security Risk Register
e Feedback (both Internal and External)
e Changes that could impact the ISMS

2.2.3.2 Review Outputs
The review shall produce
e ISMS Improvement Recommendations (SSIP opportunities)
e Updates to the Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment Plans
¢ Modifications of Processes and Procedures
¢ Endorsement of current Resource Needs

e Improvements to ISMS Effectiveness Measuring

2.3. Identifying Non-Conformities to the ISMS

Whilst desirable, it is unreasonable to assume that the ISMS will function completely smoothly
without any need to adjust any of the controls implemented.

How non-conformities to the ISMS are discovered will determine whether the Corrective or
Preventative Action Plan is followed.

However, in practice once the non-conformity has been identified the same model is used for
both Corrective and Preventative Plans thereafter

2.3.1 Corrective Action Plan

The Corrective Action Plan should be initiated when non-conformity is identified as the result of
an activity that has occurred.

Nonconformities can be identified through a number of avenues including
e Information Security Incidents
* Monitoring and Alerting
e Internal and Independent Audit Reports

Security Incident.

Potential nonconformities can be identified through a number of avenues including
* Management Reviews of the ISMS
e Internal and Independent Audit Reports
e Monitoring and Alerting

e Reporting of Information Security Weaknesses

2.4 Corrective and Preventative Action Plans

2.4.1. Determining the Causes of Non-Conformities

2.4.1.1. Technical Non-Conformities

The CISO shall liaise with appropriate technical specialists to identify the root cause of any
technical non-conformity.

2.4.1.2 Non-Technical Non-Conformities

The CISO shall engage will appropriate business representatives to identify the root cause of
any non-technical non-conformity.

2.4.2 Evaluating Actions Required

The CISO shall instigate a risk assessment to determine likelihood and impact and resulting
severity and priority of the non-conformance(s).

The results of the risk assessment shall be presented to the Quarterly Quality Management and
Security Review Board (QMSR).

Potentially the results may also be shared with POL at the Information Security Management
Forum (ISMF).

2.4.2.1 Immediate Actions

The CISO is to liaise with the Account Commercial Manager to determine whether the identified
non-conformity constitutes a breach of Contract.

Any non-conformity that constitutes a breach of Contract is to be addressed with the highest
priority and captured in the Information Security Risk Register.

Should any additional resource be required the CISO is to consider presenting mitigating
proposals at an appropriate POA Change Board.

2.4.2.2 Longer Term Remediation

An entry shall be made in the Information Security Risk Register and managed according the
combined likelihood and impact scores as defined by the Information Security Risk Management
Methodology. Additionally, ISMS non-conformities may be considered as a candidate for
remediation through the SSIP.

Information Security Risk Management

Information Security Risk Management Objectives

The objectives of the ISMS are to:
e Provide an information security framework within which the programme is developed,
delivered and implemented to all relevant areas of the business;

e Provide an organisational and responsibility framework for security activities and
allocate security roles and responsibilities;

e Identify risks associated with the provision of the POL Service, through formal risk
assessment techniques, and prioritise and implement appropriate controls and security
measures;

e Ensure appropriate security and business continuity procedures and controls are in place
to support Services provided;

e Provide a basis for review, governance, assessment and improvement of the ISMS;

e Ensure that information security controls are appropriate to the sensitivity of the
information processed and stored;

e Ensure contractual, legal & regulatory compliance across the scope of Service provision;

e Identify the security awareness and education requirements for employees and
subcontractors.

Information Security Risk Management Approach

Information Security Risks must be managed in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001:2005, LINK
ASSIS, PCI DSS Standards, as per contractually agreed version, and the Fujitsu Services
Corporate Manage Risk Process as documented in the HNG-X Information Security Risk
Management Procedure (Ref:- SVM/SEC/PRO/0033).

The POA Information Security Risk Management approach is not a blanket risk assessment
activity but a more responsive, planned or reactive technique for making business decisions
around risk and business or technical controls, on an as-needs and timely basis.

The POA will assess these risks to identify whether there are potential threats which could be
exposed by a vulnerability that, if exploited, could have an adverse impact on the POA or POL.

An entry into the Information Security Risk Register shall be seen as evidence that the
Information Security Risk Assessment process has been applied.

The Fujitsu Services Post Office Account will implement and maintain Information Security Risk
Registers which shall be the repository for Information Security Risks.

4.5 Risk Treatment Options

There are several options available when considering identified Information Security Risks. The
chosen option (or mix of management techniques) will depend on the nature and level of the
risk.

The key options are:

For low-frequency, low-impact risks, where the cost of control is greater

Risk Tolerance than the potential risk, the ISMF may choose to accept such risks.

Where an activity generates an Information Security Risk, and there is
the option to cease the particular activity or to conduct the process in a
different way, then the QMSR / ISMF may choose to do so in order to
avoid the risk concerned.

Risk Termination

Where the level of risk is unacceptable, management will employ
controls in order to manage that risk down to acceptable levels, either
Risk Treatment by mitigating the impact, or reducing the vulnerability/likelinood. Lower
impact risks will be kept under review to ensure that the trend is not
increasing, or the cumulative impact is not unacceptable.

In circumstance of potential catastrophic loss, with low probability (such
Risk Transfer as complete loss of data centre), management will opt to transfer the
risk to other parties, facilities or services.

4.6 Monitoring POA Information Security Risks

Fujitsu shall appoint an Information Security Risk Manager who shall report directly to the CISO
and shall be Fujitsu’s representative at the ISMF.

The Information Security Risk Manager shall maintain the Information Security Risk Register
and liaise with Risk Owners on the progress of Risk entries and provide summary updates to the

Information Security Policy

Fujitsu Corporate Information Security Requirement

The Post Office Account is to be compliant to the Fujitsu UK&l BMS Security Master Policy (Ref:-
CPM20) as the policy is applicable to all Employees, Contractors and businesses carried on by
Fujitsu Services Limited and its subsidiaries and any other company or organisation (including
working partners operating or carrying out work on Fujitsu UK & Ireland sites or elsewhere on
behalf of Fujitsu UK & Ireland) that is managed by the Chief Executive Officer, Fujitsu United
Kingdom and Ireland.

Failure to comply with this Policy, the Fujitsu UK&l BMS Security Policy Manual, or any
subsidiary policies and procedures or to neglect personal security responsibilities as laid down in
the Global Business Group Global Business Standards may lead to disciplinary action.

Further guidance to managing Information Security is provided in the Fujitsu Manage
Information Security Policy (Ref:- C-MSv1.10).

POA Information Security Policy

The Post Office HNG-X Account Information Security Policy (Ref:- SVM/SEC/POL/0003)
captures the Executive Information Security Policy Statement, management direction and
support for Information Security, along with the minimum standards to be met by the Post Office
Account.

It is consistent with Contractual and Regulatory commitments and relevant POL Information
Security Requirements as expressed in their Information Security policies and overarching
applicable principles of ISO/IEC27001:2005.

5.1.1.1. Communication

5.1.2

The Information Security Policy Owner shall ensure that all changes to the Post Office HNG-X
Account Information Security Policy, POA ISMS Manual and supporting documentation is
communicated across the entire Fujitsu Post Office Account and that the reviewed document
replaces the previous one so that there is only one document in circulation.

POA Information Security Policy Review

The Post Office HNG-X Account Information Security Policy is owned by the Fujitsu Post Office
Account Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) who is responsible for its maintenance and
review.

The Post Office HNG-X Account Information Security Policy will be formally reviewed at least
annually, after major changes to the scope of services and after any significant security incident
or occurrence.

The policy will be also be updated whenever necessary to reflect the needs and obligations of
the Fujitsu Post Office Account and developments in relevant best practice.

6.1.4 Authorisation Process for Information Processing Facilities

The Infrastructure Design and Build Methodology (Ref: C-IDBM1.3) is the standard lifecycle
model used within Fujitsu Services for all Infrastructure Design and Build projects.

It is made up of the following core processes, summarised and portrayed in the diagram below.

Design & Develop

I Governance

6.1.4.1 Definition

This process deals with the gathering of requirements from all stakeholders, identification of the
existing environment into which the new infrastructure must integrate, and identification of the
new technical solution. This will normally be part of a general requirements gathering activity,
and the infrastructure requirements may only be a subset of the overall requirements.

During this stage, the designer will normally need to provide technical information to the project
team to allow them to produce overview project plans and allocate resources.

Key output from this process is the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) which provides
information on where requirements are being covered, information on the requirements, and the
overall design. Initial information on the risks, issues, assumptions and dependencies is also
passed to the project managers at this stage, including technical information on the logical order
of tasks, what might make suitable work packages etc.

6.1.4.2 Design and Build Work Packages

This process takes the requirements, and turns them into a high level design, then a low level
design, and eventually into build instructions and the initial component builds. The list of items
needed is also generated during this process.

This is often considered the main part of the design process, but it cannot be successful in
isolation. Key outputs from this process are the High Level Design, Low Level Design, Bill of
Materials, build instructions, and associated automation for the builds.

6.1.4.3 Implementation Planning and Preparation

Manual

FUJITSU RESTRICTED
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

This process runs in parallel with the Design & Build process. During this phase, the designer
helps the project manager identify the work required to implement the infrastructure, and
realisable proportions for work package planning.

These steps, from planning the strategy down to more detailed planning, inform project
management planning.

6.1.4.4 Test Planning and Preparation

This process defines the activities required to plan and prepare for the verification and validation
of a deliverable.

6.1.4.5 Integration

This process takes individual components and assembles them together to form increasingly
larger components.

This process works closely with the Test Execution process, as each completed set of
components is built, they should be tested, until the solution can be tested as a whole.

6.1.4.6 Test Execution

This process defines the testing activities used to verify and validate a deliverable to ensure that
customer requirements are satisfied.

The main testing activities occur within the Integrate & Test phase; however, an important test
activity — build/unit testing is carried out as work-packages or modules are developed and built

6.1.4.7. Operational Service Planning and Preparation

This process ensures that the infrastructure solution can be supported once it is operational.
This will include planning for resources, skills and training, and ensuring that support staff have
the tools, information and access to provide effective support.

6.1.4.8 Delivery

This process is concerned with the final stages of the project, such as final builds, and
deployment into the live environment, followed by the handover to operational support.

6.1.4.9 Governance

This process is concerned with ensuring that the other IDBM processes work. This includes the
IDBM gateways, which check that the IDBM processes are being run correctly.

It also describes how designs should be peer reviewed and approved, and how change should be
handled.

6.1.5 Confidentiality Agreements

All employment contracts (permanent and temporary) as well as consultant, contractor and
supplier contracts (Generic Supplier Contract Template) include clauses governing the treatment
of Customer (in this case POL) information gained as a result of their employment.

Fujitsu staff on the Post Office Account must be aware of their obligations set out in Paragraph
2.6.3 of Schedule A4, Legislation, Policies and Standards. For clarity Paragraph 2.6.3 is
reproduced below:-

“Fujitsu Services shall not disclose any Personal Data to any person except to such of its
employees, agents, sub-contractors, third parties performing software maintenance or support
and consultants in each case who require that information in order for Fujitsu Services to
perform its obligations under this Agreement.

Prior to disclosing Personal Data or any portion thereof to such employees, agents, sub-
contractors, third parties or consultants, Fujitsu Services shall ensure the relevant employee,
agent, sub-contractor, third party or consultant is subject to a written contract with Fujitsu
Services requiring them to comply with Fujitsu Services’ obligations herein regarding the security
and confidentiality of the Personal Data and to comply with Fujitsu Services’ instructions in
processing it.

Fujitsu Services shall not knowingly cause or allow an employee, agent, sub-contractor, third
party performing software maintenance or support or consultant to process Personal Data in a
way that Fujitsu Services would not itself be entitled to process it under this Agreement.”

6.1.6 I Contact with Authorities
Co-operation with external organisations is through established Fujitsu Corporate channels.

« Contact with law enforcement authorities, government vetting agencies and Centre for
the Protection of National Infrastructure will be maintained by Fujitsu Group Security.

e Contact with regulatory bodies and the Information Commissioner will be maintained by
Fujitsu Group Legal.

6.1.7. Contact with Special Interest Groups

General contact with special interest security groups and best practice security organisations will
be maintained by the Post Office Account Security Team but only via voluntary, individual
membership of such groups and any value added provided by Fujitsu individual membership
shall be viewed as a benefit to POL.

6.1.8 Independent Review of Information Security

All areas of Information Security are subject to regular independent reviews. As documented in
the POA Audit High Level Plan these include:

e ISAE3402 - Annual external audit conducted by Ernst & Young to support POL Financial
Reporting.

e PCI -DSS — Annual requirement from POL who own and manage the audit.

¢ ISO/IEC 27001:2005 - Annual POA Accreditation which is part of Fujitsu Certification

6.2 External Parties

6.2.1 Identification of Risks Relating to External Parties

The risks associated with access to POA information and information processing facilities by
third parties will be assessed and appropriate security controls implemented in line with HNG-X
Information Security Risk Management Procedure (Ref:- SVM/SEC/PRO/0033).

These controls must be agreed, documented and defined in agreements with any external
parties.

Physical access to any POA processing facilities provided by Fujitsu shall not be provided to
third parties until all security requirements have been satisfied and evidence recorded.

POA will create and maintain a register of external parties with connections to Services provided
to POL.

6.2.1.1 3 Party Connectivity

As described in the HNG-X Network Architecture (Ref:- ARC/NET/ARC/0001) Third parties will
connect to a Transit LAN. The Transit LAN is considered to be the boundary between the HNG-X
network and any externally administered organisation that HNG-X connects to.

The transit LAN exists both for security and to provide an unambiguous demarcation between
HNG-X and that organisation

6.2.1.2 Off-Shoring

Prior to any off shoring work undertaken, staff must refer to the CESG Good Practice Guide No
6 to Off Shoring Managing Security Risks.

Note:- POL have a requirement to advise Government clients of any off-shoring of any
service/support service which may impact upon Government information/data.

6.2.2 Addressing Security when Dealing with Customers

Any customer access to POL Account information will be subject to the requirements of the HNG-
X Account Information Security Policy (Ref:- SVM/SEC/POL/0003) and applicable components
of this ISMS Manual.

6.2.3. Addressing Security in Third Party Agreements

Suppliers of goods and services to Fujitsu that support the Services provided to POL must be
subject to formal agreements, using the (Fujitsu) Generic Supplier Contract Template (or
equivalent) document as a baseline standard.

The Ariba system is Fujitsu's standard toolset for the Managed Procurement Cycle and
Contracting with Suppliers processes and captures all evidence of compliance with and approval
of the project steps belonging to these processes. It also captures Third Party Governance.
(http://www.cafevik. fs. fujitsu.com/00110/manageprocurement/Pages/home.aspx )

Individual agreements with suppliers of standard COTS components are not required provided
that there is clear evidence the components meet all security, regulatory and contractual
requirements.

Asset Management

Responsibility for Assets

Inventory of Assets

Asset identification and recording is a key aspect of Information Security management and is the
maintenance of correct and up-to-date asset information is key to a number of business
objectives as described in the Information and Technology Group Hardware Asset Management
Policy (Ref:- ITGSM-POL-003).

The POA maintains a Transfer Asset Management Database which is owned by the Commercial
Manager. This database contains the data maintained on all major asset hardware, software,
development, and data holdings held in an Access database, which is further documented in the
Transfer Asset Register (Ref:- COM/MGT/REP/0001).

The Asset Register covers:
e All assets employed by Fujitsu specifically for the delivery of the Services.
e This asset register is a snapshot in time and details assets as at a set moment in time
and the impact of any changes due to the development of POL projects that are in
progress at this time are not included.

The register is structured according to the main categories of asset, namely:
Software

Hardware

Documentation

Data

The assets identified within the database are shown where appropriate by their functionality ie:-
Production, Test and Development, Counter Estate, Supplier/Third Party.

Ownership of Assets

All assets issued as part of the POA HNG-X Service will be assigned an owner, who will be
responsible for the asset as per the Fujitsu UK & Ireland Business Management System Security
Policy Manual.

The owner may be a team, rather than an individual. Details of ownership must be documented
in the inventory of assets which will be reviewed regular (at least yearly) to ensure its accuracy.

Acceptable Use Policy

All personnel using Fujitsu Post Office Account and Corporate systems will be subject to Fujitsu
corporate acceptable use policies as captured in the Fujitsu UK & Ireland Business Management
System Security Policy Manual, the Acceptable Use of IT Within Fujitsu Services and the Fujitsu
UK & Ireland Business Operations, Information and Technology Group Internal IT Policy
(Ref:ITG-PO1).

7.2 Information Classification

7.2.1 Fujitsu / POL Classification Guidelines

All information concerning POL and its contracted services, that are not in the public domain,
shall be considered potentially sensitive and by default treated as private to POL and its
contractors.

Fujitsu has a formal approach to information classification documented in the Fujitsu UK &
Ireland Business Management System Security Policy Manual.

The POL Limited Community Information Security Policy for Horizon & Horizon Online (Ref:-
External Document - POL/HNG/CIS/001) documents the Information Security Classifications
used within POL.

All Users who have access to multiple sources of sensitive, personal, contractual or financial
data and whereby this information is then acquired or stored by them run the risk that the
classification level (through aggregation) may increase /decrease and this must be reviewed and
assessed.

The current Fujitsu and POL approved markings consist of a classification level and Fujitsu also
has an optional qualifier.

7.2.1.1 Fujitsu Unclassified

Information marked as Unclassified can be freely shared inside and outside of the company.
This marking is optional where its use is unnecessary, however it must be used where there may
be some uncertainty about the classification to remove any ambiguity. By definition, Unclassified
would never be associated with a qualifier.

7.2.1.2 Fujitsu Restricted

This marking is used for information where there is no reason for disclosure outside of Fujitsu (or
the ‘qualifier’ group if present) and where disclosure to unauthorized persons might cause minor
damage.

Examples are company announcements on business plans and internal telephone directories.

7.2.1.3 Fujitsu Confidential

This is used for information where unauthorised disclosure (even within Fujitsu) would cause
significant harm to our interests. This would normally inflict harm by virtue of financial loss; loss
of profitability or opportunity; embarrassment or loss of reputation.

Examples are sensitive customer information, negotiating positions, market assessments, or
competitive information, and technical information that could impact the security of IT systems.

7.2.1.4 Fujitsu Secret

This is used for information and material of an extremely confidential and sensitive nature, or of
strategic importance, the disclosure of which could cause grave damage to the interests of the
Company.

Examples are high-level business and competition strategy and plans, very sensitive competitor,
partner or contractor assessments, patent secrecy information, and information, including
passwords, vital to the security of IT systems.

7.2.1.5 Fujitsu Optional Qualifiers - Eyes Only

This indicates the scope of data disclosure (e.g. Fujitsu UK&l Eyes Only or Applications Services
Eyes Only).

7.2.1.6 Fujitsu Optional Qualifiers - Commercially Sensitive

This applies to information and material which is intended to be shared with a limited number of
third parties for business purposes and where disclosure would not result in any significant
impact to either Fujitsu or the recipient. It would be used in conjunction with Fujitsu Restricted.

7.2.1.7 Fujitsu Optional Qualifiers - Commercial in Confidence

This applies to information and material, the unauthorized disclosure of which could cause
embarrassment or might be detrimental to the interests of the Company, but which nevertheless
can be shared with third parties if necessary for business purposes. It would usually be used with
Fujitsu Confidential but could be used with Fujitsu Restricted (ie this document).

7.2.1.8 Fujitsu Optional Qualifiers - Personal Addressee Only

This is used where a confidential document is sent to a person where access should be limited to
the owner, their delegated representatives, and the intended recipient of the document. An
example would be a letter re pay increases. Where the document contains personal information,
it would have a handling marking of Fujitsu Confidential.

7.2.1.9 Fujitsu Optional Qualifiers — Staff Restricted

This is used for matters relating to staff and their services, where the subject matter under
discussion could apply to a group of staff, and where disclosure or unauthorized access could
lead to commercial embarrassment or staff discontent. Examples are bonus scheme details and
warnings over disciplinary matters not attributable to an individual.

7.2.1.10 Fujitsu Optional Qualifiers — Personal Information

This marking should also be used for Personal Information requiring special handling. This
comprises sensitive personal information as described in the UK Data Protection Act along with
other personal information that Fujitsu believes should be subject to similar protection.

Any document containing such personal information should have a handling marking of Fujitsu
Confidential or Fujitsu Secret.

7.2.1.11 POL Confidential

“Information that has been assessed to be of a sensitive nature and likely to cause damage
following unauthorised disclosure. Personal data (as defined by the Data Protection Act) is
classified as confidential. Personal data includes customer account numbers and any transaction
data associated with them. FAD codes are sometimes used for authentication purposes and

9 Physical and Environmental Security

9.1 Secure Areas

9.1.1 Physical Security Perimeter

Group Property and Group Security have ultimate responsibility for physical security at all sites
used by the Post Office Account.

The POA CISO is responsible for working with Group Property and Group Security to ensure that
the appropriate physical and environmental controls are in place, based on risk assessment, to
protect assets from unauthorised access, damage and interference in line with POA
requirements.

All physical perimeters of Fujitsu POL Account sites are clearly defined and site security
personnel at Fujitsu POL Account sites maintain an appropriate level of control over the physical
security perimeter of each site deploying security barriers, entry controls, CCTV, security fences,
special lighting etc. as necessary.

Within all POA sites consideration is also given to any security threats presented by
neighbouring premises.

Intrusion detection alarm systems must be used for installations which are left unattended and
Alarm Systems must be tested regularly and maintained to manufacturers’ requirements.

There are regular visits by Fujitsu Corporate to Fujitsu POA sites to maintain the appropriate
levels of physical security ensuring no gaps or weaknesses are introduced.

Data Centres providing processing facilities for Post Office data will have much higher levels of
physical security than general offices even though their outward appearance may portray a lower
Fujitsu Corporate profile.

All Fujitsu Data Centres are audited frequently in accordance with the Group Security Site Audits
Process (Ref:- GB/BSA/0002) for Physical Security and the POA will work closely with the Data
Centre Managers to ensure that any observations are acted upon. (It should be noted that this is
not just limited to the activities conducted by POA sponsored external auditors).

In short, any POA / POL sensitive information, wherever it is stored, must be physically
protected in line with the Information Security Policy and Contractual obligations.

9.1.2 Physical Entry Controls

Generic physical access is the responsibility of Group Property and Group Security has ultimate
responsibility for physical security at all sites used by the Post Office Account.

Data centres providing processing facilities for POL data have very high levels of physical
security and access is in accordance with Data Centres Site Access System: User Guide (Ref:
1SNO001021).

POA visitors to POL sites will be subject to any POL screening/vetting procedures and must
abide by processes and procedures for such visits provided to the by POL.

9.1.3 Securing Offices, Rooms and Facilities

The Fujitsu's POA employs a best practice approach to securing offices, rooms and facilities
across all sites, including a Clear Desk Policy.

In practice this means
e Access to all secure areas is strictly controlled.

e All papers, discs and portable media that contain Fujitsu’s POA Information are to be
stored in an appropriately secured place when not in use.

e PCs and workstations are to be protected by passwords and, either locked or a password-
protected screen-saver invoked when not in use.

e Support functions and equipment e.g. photocopiers, fax machines must be sited
appropriately within the secure area to avoid demands for access which could
compromise information.

e Doors and windows must be locked when unattended and external protection must be
considered for windows particularly at ground level.

e Directories and internal telephone books identifying locations of sensitive processing
facilities must not be readily accessible by the public.

e The use of portable wireless devices, including items such as 3G phones, is forbidden in
areas where sensitive data is stored, processed or transmitted. Cameras, and mobile
phones with built in cameras are similarly prohibited.

9.1.4 Protecting Against External and Environmental Threats

Detailed policy for Physical and Environmental security of Data Centre environments
(ISN/001377) is included in Fujitsu Data Centre Security Policies.

The selection and design of a secure area must take account of the possibility of damage from
fire, flood, explosion, civil unrest and other forms of natural or manmade disasters.

Account should also be taken of relevant health and safety standards and consideration must be
given also to any security threats presented by neighbouring premises.

Hazardous or combustible materials must be stored securely at a safe distance from a secure
area and bulk supply such as stationery must not be stored within a secure area until required.

There is a Live and Test/DR Data Centre. In the event that there is a disaster at the live site, a
decision is required to invoke manual fail-over to the Test/DR Data Centre with RTOs of 2, 5 and
48 hours depending upon the service.

Data is replicated between the Live and Test/DR Data Centre in real time, over the inter-site link
in order to avoid the delays, costs and security risks inherent in moving data physically and to
meet agreed RPOs.

There is sufficient resilience built into the Live Data-centre to minimise the risk of equipment or
service failures invoking the HNG-X Data Centre disaster recovery plan.

9.1.5 Working in Secure Areas

Information processing facilities for POL data must be housed in secure areas in accordance
with the Fujitsu UK&l BMS Security Policy Manual.

Managers responsible for secure areas must ensure that access rights to secure areas are
regularly reviewed and updated at least monthly.

Information processing facilities managed by POA must be physically separated from those
managed by third parties.

Physical and logical segregation of POA Assets from other Fujitsu contracts must be maintained,
however shared use of data centres, server rooms and environmental facilities is permitted.

Security measures associated with installed equipment must take these factors into
consideration to reduce POA's risks to an acceptable level.

Similar considerations apply to POA Assets at other non-POA sites (e.g. AP Client sites).

Unoccupied secure areas must be physically locked and subject to at least daily periodic checks,
and there must be physical protection and guidelines for those staff working in secure areas.

Access to sensitive information and information processing facilities must be controlled and
restricted to authorised persons only. Authentication controls (e.g. swipe card plus PIN) must be
used to authorise and validate all access. An audit trail of all access must be maintained
securely.

9.1.6 Public Access, Delivery and Loading Areas

The Fujitsu UK&l BMS Security Policy Manual specifically states that Public access to Fujitsu's
POA sites will be through main entrances.

Additionally there is clear direction that where POA sites have isolated delivery and loading
areas then these will be monitored when in use by the site security staff either directly or via the
site CCTV.

Direct access to the site will not normally be granted to staff via the loading bay or delivery area.
The loading bay and delivery area doors are to be kept locked when not in use.

9.2.5.1. Security Advice — Top 10 Tips to Protecting Laptops and Portable
Media

There is guidance on the Fujitsu UK& I Security Portal for Fujitsu staff in protecting laptops and
portable media:-

e Only devices registered with and provided and built by Fujitsu may be connected to the
Fujitsu network. Item such as Modems, PDAs, Mobile Telephones and other such
peripherals must not be connected to a PC or laptop which is or can be also connected
to any network that is supporting the Fujitsu business. Such action may inadvertently
enable unauthorised users to access Fujitsu systems.

e Never leave equipment unattended in a public place. Most hotels provide safes, either in
rooms or at reception: use these to store valuable equipment and information when not
in use.

e Avoid displaying any sensitive information on your laptop screen in a public place — you
never know who may be looking over your shoulder.

e Make sure that your password is a mix of at least eight alphabetic and numeric
characters. A password can be made stronger if desired or if required to meet a specific
standard by increasing the number of characters and using upper and lower case and
punctuation symbols.

e Before you take your laptop out of the office make sure the hard disk is encrypted.

« When travelling by car: laptops must be stored out of sight in the boot of the car and
must not be left in unattended vehicles. Always put your laptop and valuables out of site
prior to starting your journey as it is known that thieves can wait at traffic lights watching
for cars to stop and then stealing items by simply opening the car door.

e You must not take your laptop or mobile anywhere outside the UK without written
approval from your line manager.

e Non-Fujitsu laptops must not be connected to the Fujitsu networks in any way or used to
store any company information.

e If you have an RSA Token, do not store it with your laptop, keep them separately.
«The use of non-encrypted USB devices is prohibited.

9.2.6 Secure Disposal or Re-use

The reuse, resale and safe disposal of redundant IT equipment within the POA is provided by
Fujitsu’s Supply and Lifecycle Services based in Warrington under the Manage Recycle Service
(Ref:- SC002).

The Service cover all aspects associated with the recycling and refurbishment of IT equipment;
from cleaning, auditing, data purging, testing and disposal and in addition Supply and Lifecycle
Services provides a guarantee of compliance with all environmental legislation.

Removal and or Destruction of Electronic Media (Ref:- SVM/SDM/PRO/0039) defines the
procedures for handling the removal and or destruction of electronic media that is faulty, or
requires replacement that holds (or may have held) Sensitive information.

9.2.7.2 Data Centre Procedures

The Data Centres Data Handling Policy (Ref:- ISNO06632) is compliant with Fujitsu corporate
policies on handling and transporting data and media (as captured in the Fujitsu UK&l BMS
Security Policy Manual) and explicitly states that with the exception of Break / Fix requirements
(Break-Fix Data Handling SOP (Ref:- ISNO7358))an MSC must be raised by the account for all
transportation of Data and Equipment irrespective of Protective Marking. This MSC must detail
the name of the courier or Trusted Person as well as the Protective Marking or labelling of any
data.

9.2.7.3 Security Staff - Random Checks

The Fujitsu UK&l BMS Security Policy Manual also states that Security employees may
undertake random checks to ensure that property being removed from Fujitsu UK&l premises
(with the exceptions stated above) has the correct authorised documentation.

9.2.7.4 Decommissioning of Equipment

All decommissioning must take account of the removal of any sensitive or confidential
information stored on any hardware or electronic media including backups and must ensure that
any equipment that is not required is securely stored and documented or disposed of in a secure
manner (including network equipment). This includes all equipment used to provide the POA

service.

10 Communications and Operations Management
10.1 Operational Procedures and Responsibilities

10.1.1 Documented Operating Procedures

The Configuration Plan for HNG-X (Ref:- PGM/CM/PLA/0001) provides an overview used to
provide version control and Configuration Management of all Software, Document Management
and Change Management configuration items used within the POA solution.

Documents are considered by the POA HNG-X Programme as configurable items and managed
as such, with unique identification and strict version control. Documents are defined as outputs
from each of the programme lifecycle stages which describe and support the delivery of
applications and environments for the HNG-x solution. These are controlled documents and will
reside in the HNG-X Dimensions configuration management database.

This is also the case for documents originating from sources external to Fujitsu.

Operating procedures must be treated as formal documents. They must have a named Owner
and a Security Classification applied and any Changes must only be made after approval by
authorised management.

10.1.1.1 Support Guides

The HNG-X Design & Build Methodology Implementation & Support Documentation Process
(Ref:- PGM/PAS/PRO/0007) states the requirement for a Support Guide (SPG), which will
provide technical support staff with information to enable them to support that system once it has
gone live.

Support guides are also required by the End to End Application Support Strategy (Ref:-
SVM/SDM/PRO/0875) and generally written by a combination of the architect / designer for the
product and the developers of that product and are based on the DEV/GEN/TEM/0009 document
management template.

10.1.2 Change Management

Changes to the provision of services, must be formally managed, taking account of the criticality
of business, systems and processes involved and the re-assessment of risks.

The Fujitsu POA has a dedicated Change Management function governed by the Fujitsu
Manage Change Policy (Ref: SM-3) and Manage Change Process (Ref: C-MSv1.5).

Information Security is an integral component of the POA Change Management function and is
evidenced by the Account Security Management participation in the Change Boards (PCCB &
CCB) and the Managed Service Change (MSC) process.

The Change Boards have the total authority and responsibility to accept, reject or defer a
Change Proposal (CP) irrespective of its origination (Customer or Internal) and as such acts on
behalf of the POA Management Team.

10.1.2.1 Change Owner

This is the individual who owns the change and will progress it through from inception through
impacting to Board Presentation, agreement to implementation, support and finally to closure.

The Change Owner has the following responsibilities:-
¢ Understand and own the business need identified within the CP on behalf of the POA.

10.1.3 Segregation of Duties

Accountability of individuals is essential and segregation of duties will be enforced where
deemed necessary.

It is the responsibility of Line Management to facilitate such separation and to brief staff on any
special responsibilities in order to reduce opportunities for unauthorised modification or misuse
of information or services.

Specific requirements for banking keys are described within CS/OLA/051/052 and
CS/OLA/051/053 for POA Network Banking Key Management.

10.1.4 Separation of Development, Test and Operational Facilities

Security testing is a critical part of the HNG-X programme. It is vitally important to ensure that
the security principles have been followed and that the subsequent security controls have been
deployed correctly.

The test environments are
e Solution Validation & Integration (SV&l) (Ref:- DEV/INF/LLD/0032)
¢ Live System Test (LST) (Ref:- DEV/INF/LLD/0112)

IRE19 will host the Live System Test (LST) and Systems Validation and Integrity (SV&I) test
environments during normal (IRE11 Live) operation. Test systems shall only share logical
network connection with operational systems in carefully controlled circumstances.

The security testing process is an iterative one, beginning with stringent and exhaustive
component testing of individual platform foundation builds and software, as they are released for
system testing.

During each subsequent phase of testing, it is expected that the security testing load will change
as the initial tests will not need to be repeated and the testing focus will move to cover
integration features and the validation of firewall rules and access control lists.

Development, test, and operational facilities must be separated wherever possible to reduce the
risks of unauthorised access, or changes, to operational systems.

10.2 Third Party Service Delivery Management

10.2.1 Service Delivery

The POA engages with a number of 3° Parties to deliver Services to POL and engage with
Procurement in accordance with the Fujitsu UK&l BMS Procurement Master Policy (CMP24),
associated processes and systems manage the POA's supplier relationships.

The Ariba system is the standard toolset for the Managed Procurement Cycle and Contracting
with Suppliers processes and is the central repository for all 3% Parties engaged by the POA and
the system allows the POA to capture all evidence of compliance with and approval of the
project steps belonging to these processes. It also captures Third Party Governance and
Supplier Performance Management.

10.2.2 Monitoring and Review of Third Party Services

Within the POA, the management of 3” Party Suppliers is governed by the Supplier
Management for Non-Procurement Supplier Managers (Ref:- I-Mco1.3) to ensure the continuous

ongoing management, assessment and evaluation of the performance of POA Suppliers.

10.3 System Planning and Acceptance

10.3.1 Capacity Planning

The HNG-X Capacity Management and Business Volumes (Ref:- PA/PER/033) documents the
process of managing the business workload volumes that the HNG-X system will support and the
capacity required to support this workload under contract extension.

The following agreed principles under which business volumes and capacity will be managed
include:-

« Post Office estimates the business volumes that the system needs to support. As part of
this assessment they need to decide how much headroom or contingency for
unexpected growth in volumes is required.

e Fujitsu Services will support the Contracted Volumes and implement the infrastructure
needed to support that level of business volumes. This infrastructure may be
implemented in several phases if all of the additional capacity is not needed initially.

e Appropriate lets are given against Service Levels if the business volumes are exceeded.

e The Service Management Relationship will periodically review the actual business
volumes handled by the system and projected future volumes, to allow sufficient notice
to be given to allow any additional capacity to be installed

e Fujitsu Services shall maintain the capacity model that is shared with Post Office. This
allows the impact of changes to be jointly assessed.

10.3.2 System Acceptance

Acceptance criteria for new information systems, upgrades and new versions shall be
established and suitable tests of the system, including any security requirements, carried out
prior to acceptance.

This is delivered under Project Management within the established Corporate Customer Solution
Lifecycle (CSLC).

The CSLC defines how Fujitsu Services follows a lifecycle of ten stages from early prospecting,
through contract approval and signature, to project delivery and subsequent ongoing service
delivery.

Within the Fujitsu’s POA ISMS there are a number of activities that are required to occur within
the overall System Acceptance process. Key activities are captured as:-

10.3.2.1 Project Initiation Review

The purpose of this formal Project Initiation Review is to confirm and ensure that all project
requirements, including definitions and control mechanisms are in place for full implementation
of the plan/timetable and that the project has a sound basis to proceed.

In addition, the Service Readiness Checklist should be used to guide preparation for acceptance
and introduction of the final solution into the live service environment.

Although this is the first formal documented project initiation review within the business delivery
procedure, it is expected that the definition will have evolved with the appropriate level of
verification from project delivery managers during the bidding cycle.

This is the formal confirmation, which authorises the definitive Project Initiation Document.

10.4 Protection against Malicious and Mobile Code

10.4.1 Controls against Malicious Software

HNG-X Architecture — Security Architecture (Ref:- ARC/SEC/ARC/0003) describes that the HNG-
X uses the Sophos anti-virus product and is implemented on all Microsoft Windows 2003 Data
Centre platforms and Microsoft Windows XP Support Workstations connected to a Data Centre
network (i.e. from a remote site).

Anti-virus signatures and updates will be subject to LST testing to ensure their integrity and will
be applied using the Tivoli software distribution system rather than the Sophos management
tools to ensure consistency of delivery to system-managed platforms.

Anti-virus software will not be deployed onto either the existing Horizon Windows NT Counters or
onto any HNG-X Counter.

Remote support workstations that are not under the control of the HNG-X Data Centre will be
updated as required by the Fujitsu Corporate Security Policy document.

10.4.2 Controls against Mobile Code

Mobile code is software code which transfers from one computer to another computer and then
executes automatically and performs a specific function with little or no user interaction.

Fujitsu will use generally industry accepted practises in the management of mobile code and will
apply suitable controls within operating systems policies and end user browser settings.

The HNG-X Secure Coding Guidelines (Ref:- DEV/APP/WKI/1979) provides a set of secure
coding guidelines for developers and designers producing executable code and application
configurations for HNG-X.

HNG-X Java Coding Standards (Ref:- DEV/APP/WKI/0005) provides guidelines that should be
used on projects that use Java as an implementation language.

These guidelines aim to address the task of writing good maintainable code by defining
requirements for the mechanical aspects of implementation, such as, layout, comments, naming
conventions etc.

Specifically, the objectives of these guidelines are:

* To establish a common layout of source code. A common layout makes it easier for
developers familiar with these guidelines to maintain code that they are unfamiliar with.

e To improve the quality of code so that it is easier to understand, easier to test, and
easier to maintain. For example, by specifying how some language constructs should be
used common pitfalls can be avoided.

e To create well commented source code that will form part of the documentation of the

system.

10.5 Backup

10.5.1 Information Backup

Data backups are an essential component of HNG-X and are potentially critical in ensuring data
availability in the event of data corruption or system failure.

Data corruption may occur as a result of user error, application error, middleware error,
hardware failure or firmware bugs. Data corruption means that the data is no longer readable, or
is no longer the data that was written.

In the context of POA HNG-X very little data cannot be recovered from "precursor" data that is
data in an upstream system or from a previous processing step.

The Backup and Recovery sub-system delivers the functionality required to recover from data
corruption and forms part of the overall solution architecture, as required by

e Section 6, “Availability” - HNG-x Solution Architecture Outline (Ref:-
ARC/SOL/ARC/0001)

¢ Section 5.2.6, “Data Recovery” - System Qualities Architecture (Ref:-
ARC/PER/ARC/0001)

A number of backup patterns are used in order to suit the application recovery requirements, and
also to maximise the reuse of existing Horizon solutions where appropriate, as these are tried
and tested solutions and the overall backup solution is described in HNG-X Backup and
Recovery HLD (Ref:- DES/SYM/HLD/0015).

There is no "off-site" storage of data at a third party site. IRE11 and IRE19 are used to hold
duplicate copies, and all replication is via the core network or the SAN. There is no requirement
to transfer media between IRE11 and IRE19, all such transfer is performed via the SAN.

10.5.1.1 Symantec Netbackup

The HNG-X NetBackup Support Guide (Ref:- DEV/GEN/SPG/0005) provides a work instruction
for Netbackup Operators performing Symantec NetBackups on HNG-X and POLMI.

10.5.1.2 Oracle Recovery Manager

Recovery Manager is a standard Oracle product that is used to backup the Branch Database,
Branch Support Database, Network Persistent Store Database and APOP Database to Oracle
Automatic Storage Management disks.

The Host Branch Database Support Guide (Ref:- DES/APP/SPG/0001) and the Network
Persistence Store (NPS) Database Support Guide (Ref:- DEV/APP/SPG/0027) have a backup
and recovery sections and depending upon requirements either a Full (Level 0) or Incremental
(Level 1) database backups are written to both the IRE11 and IRE19 SANs.

10.6 Network Security Management

10.6.1 Network Controls

The network architecture provides facilities to securely transmit data, to provide remote access
and to segment networks. In addition analysis and reporting facilities are provided to report
against SLAs and to enable base-lining and trending to be performed.

The following facilities are supplied by the service;
e Provides secure network capabilities
e Provides secure remote access facilities.
e Provides network segmentation.
e Enables network analysis and reporting.
e Controls and manages network access control.

Detailed information on the HNG-X network infrastructure is contained in the HNG-X Network
Architecture (Ref:- ARC/NET/ARC/0001)

10.6.2 Security of Network Services

Network-based intrusion detection is deployed as part of the HNG-X Data Centre infrastructure.
This will provide notification of an attempted compromise of systems within the Data Centre,
through malicious activity or malicious code.

This capability is provided using McAfee Intrushield IPS appliances as defined in the IDS LLD
(Ref:- DEV/INF/LLD/0051).

Although these devices are capable of Intrusion Prevention they are deployed in passive mode
as IDS sensors on selected traffic paths. The traffic paths to be monitored were identified by risk
assessment during the IDS design phase and are documented in the IDS Appliance LLD.

As part of the System design process for new services, additional paths may be included in the
monitoring with updates to the IDS Appliance LLD as required.

The appliances will allow the monitoring of multiple physical network segments from a single
appliance. The appliances are designed to prevent traffic flowing between sensor ports. l.e. it is
not possible for the appliance to act as a Router and connect networks, thereby bypassing other
security controls.

In addition to raising alerts of malicious activity, the IDS sensors will send feed event logs into
the secure event management service, to provide an audit trail and to enable additional event
correlation with Firewall, Router and other network device logs.

10.6.2.1 Tivoli Event Management System

Intrusion attempts will be detected through the use of the Tivoli event management system and
specifically, alerts raised as a result of failed attempts to logon or to access data with invalid
permissions.

defined by the PCI-DSS, the following requirements will be met for Horizon-Online Counters.

e No full track, (magnetic stripe or chip), images will be stored post-authorisation.

e¢ No PIN or PIN Block information will be stored post-authorisation.

e« No CVV2, CVC2 or CID information will be stored. (This data is used for card not
present transactions which the Horizon-Online system does not currently perform)

e PANs will be hashed, encrypted or otherwise obfuscated by overwriting.

10.9.1.3. Audit Tracks

As described in Horizon (On-Line) Architecture —- Support Services (Ref:- ARC/SVS/ARC/0001)
Audit Tracks generated after the implementation of CP4305 do not contain the PAN in clear text.
Instead there is an encrypted version of the PAN and, in a separate field, a securely hashed
version of the PAN. Audit Tracks that were generated pre CP4305 continue to contain a clear

text version of the PAN.

10.9.2 On-Line Transactions

As captured in the HNG-X Architecture —- Security Architecture (ARC/SEC/ARC/0003) the

solution has been designed to ensure that for online transactions.

10.10 Monitoring

10.10.1 Audit Logging

Within the HNG-X system, Fujitsu Services are required to provide facilities to produce, store

and present to (customer) auditors for analysis Audit Track data in support of the security policy and
audit requirements laid down for the system.
The Horizon (On-Line) Architecture - Support Service (Ref:- ARC/SVS/ARC/0001) states that
within HNG-X, audit data is collected from a number of subsystems. The basic types of audit
data that is collected are:

e Counter application messages as received by the Branch Access Layer and stored in the
Branch Database message journal table. This will include counter transactions and
events

e Data transferred across HNG-X system boundaries. E.g. Bulk file transfers to and from
Post Office and their clients

¢ Host database systems audit and archive data. In this context database audit data
refers to the saving of logs of updates applied to the databases, and database archive
data refers to the saving of old data that has been purged from the primary databases.

« HNG-X system events — including security events

¢ Logging of activities undertaken by administrative users during maintenance of the
system

e System scheduler logs

Audit data may be requested by a number of different end users, for a number of different
reasons. These include:

e Post Office Auditors in connection with Fraud investigations — in which case the data
may be presented as evidence in court.

¢ Fujitsu Services Post Office Account Security Operations Team monitoring compliance
with security requirements

e Post Office users handling enquiries regarding banking transactions

e Fujitsu Services System Support Centre for diagnostic information

The Audit system is comprised of:

e An Audit Server located at each campus — these operate Active/Active

e AnEMC Centera storage array located at each campus

« Anumber of audit workstations situated at Bracknell & Lewes.

e Dedicated HP Atalla Network Security Processors situated at Bracknell & Lewes.

Each Audit Server is responsible for gathering Audit Tracks from subsystems and securing them
on the local Centera array (secure long term storage). This data is subsequently replicated to

the Audit Server at the other campus to ensure that two copies of all Audit Tracks are maintained.
As well as gathering and storing audit data on EMC Centera, the Audit Server provides services
to retrieve data from the Audit Archive. These services are utilized by the Audit Workstations.
The Audit server hosts two Microsoft SQL Server 2000 databases, which are resident on its local
storage:

e The Sealer database which is used to manage the Gathering & storage of Audit tracks

10.10.2 Monitoring System Use

The Enterprise Management software suite, known as SYSMAN3, is an integration of Software
Distribution, Asset Management, Event Monitoring, Remote Support and Remote Diagnostics,
based around IBM Tivoli software.

The HNG-X System and Estate Management: Monitoring (Ref:- ARC/SYM/ARC/0003) defines
the Monitoring functions of SYSMAN3.

Service Monitoring will be performed by event flow; events may be collected in both an active
and passive manner, and alerts may be created by sampling, aggregating, correlating or apply
other rules on the raw incoming events.

Active monitoring will be achieved by agents looking for known stimuli and raising events via the
relevant Event Logs. The IBM Tivoli Monitoring and TEM suite of programs will be used for
active monitoring within the solution.

Passive monitoring is the process of collecting events that are already created within the
environment (e.g. in the Unix Syslog or Windows Event Log etc.).

The events selected, after the rules are applied at the source, will be forwarded through the
network infrastructure to an event collection layer which we may define as event sink. The others
will remain in the underlying source but are not forwarded.

10.10.2.1 Tivoli Event Management System

Intrusion attempts will be detected through the use of the Tivoli Event Management (TEM)
system and specifically, alerts raised as a result of failed attempts to logon or to access data with
invalid permissions.

10.10.2.2 File Integrity Monitoring

File Integrity Monitoring is provisioned by Tripwire and is integrated within the HNG-X systems
management tools for event and incident management and for software distribution and is in
place to meet the requirements of Post Office in support of PCI Compliance.

10.10.3 Protection of Log Information

HNG-X Architecture — Security Architecture (Ref:- ARC/SEC/ARC/0003) describes that all
events from each Data Centre Platform Instance system event log are read in real-time and
captured by the Tivoli software.

Each entry to the file is read, converted into Tivoli Common Format and forwarded to the Tivoli
collection layer as soon as it has been written.

The log files are then securely managed by the Tivoli event management system through a
combination of user, file and database access control. This is in addition to the infrastructure
access control provided by the Horizon-Online infrastructure such as segregated networking.

The Tivoli system has inbuilt role based access control facilities and these will be implemented
to ensure that the users of the system, (administrative or otherwise), can only access the tools and
functions that they need.

The administrative users of the Tivoli system will use the Identity and Access Management
service for access control and will require a token to be able to logon to the system.

Non-administrative users, (such as Helpdesk staff), will have a set number of Tivoli tasks that
can be executed on specific systems and will have very restricted command line access for obtaining
specific diagnostic or log data.

10.10.4 Administrator and Operator Logs

As captured in HNG-X Architecture — Security Architecture (Ref:- ARC/SEC/ARC/0003) event
analysis and alerting take place in real-time and detailed event correlation reduces the number
of events seen by the operator.

Furthermore the Horizon (On-Line) Architecture — Support Service (Ref:- ARC/SVS/ARC/0001)
states that within Horizon (Online), audit data is collected from a number of subsystems. The
following categories of audit data are collected:

e Counter application messages received by the Branch Access Layer. This will include
counter transactions and events

e Data transferred across Horizon (Online) system boundaries. E.g. Bulk file transfers to and
from Post Office and their clients

e Solaris Host database systems audit and archive data. In this context database audit data
refers to the saving of logs of updates applied to the databases, and database archive data
refers to the saving of old data that has been purged from the primary databases.

e NPS database audit data containing a record of banking transactions.
e Horizon (Online) system events — including security events

e Logging of activities undertaken by Fujitsu Services Post Office Account staff during
maintenance of the system

e System scheduler logs

10.10.5.1 Fujitsu Corporate Assets

All faults with Fujitsu assets are to be reported to the Fujitsu Services 7799 Helpdesk in line with
the requirements set out in the Fujitsu UK&l BMS Manage Incidents Policy (Ref:- SM-5).

10.10.5.2 Service Delivery Units / 3 Party HNG-X Assets

Hardware or Software errors within the HNG-X environment are reported to the Service Desk
and managed to closure in accordance with the POA Operations Incident Management
Procedure (Ref:- SVM/SDM/PRO/0018).

Where hardware device support is provided by other Service Delivery Units / 3° Parties then the
Systems Management & Global Cloud (SMC) contact them directly in accordance with
(document to be provided by SMC)

10.10.6 Clock Synchronisation

As documented in HNG-X Network Architecture (Ref:- ARC/NET/ARC/0001) time clocks within
the service will be synchronised with a reliable time source.

It is further documented in HNG-X System and Estate Management — Overall Architecture (Ref:-
ARC/SYM/ARC/0001) that there is a hierarchical solution consisting of several layers (or strata):

e The first stratum is the primary time source. This needs to be a highly reliable and the
choice is the GPS satellite network. A data centre resident GPS time server uses rooftop
antenna to receive signals from the satellite.

e The secondary stratum is the data centre which contains all the server platforms and
network appliances.

These platforms poll the primary time server using version 3 of the NTP protocol as defined in
RFC 1305 and requesting the time in UTC format. The NTP product on the platform is
configured to achieve millisecond accuracy but will also protect against large clock shifts in a
single request after the first synchronisation on reboot.

10.10.6.1 Non Branch HNG-X Network Components

All Data Centre components use a GPS receiver as the NTP time source. Non Data Centre
components use Access tier switches as NTP time source.

10.10.6.2 Branch Router
The Branch Router uses an NTP Server on the Boot platform.

11 Access Control

11.1 Business Requirement for Access Control

11.1.1

Access Control Policy

The Fujitsu UK & Ireland Business Management System Security Policy Manual has a clear
statement that, “Access must be controlled to Fujitsu UK&l sites, logical and physical assets,
business processes and functionality”.

Access may be the result of direct user action, or automatically initiated activities and Access
Control is the fundamental requirement in managing these access activities to information or
services on information processing systems to preserve the Confidentiality, Integrity and
Availability of POA and POL business information, services and processes on the basis of
business and security requirements.

11.1.1.1. Key Principles

11.1.1.2

Physical and logical access to all areas, systems and networks must be controlled and
consistent, with access granted selectively, and permitted only where there is a specific
need ensuring that there is segregation of access control roles, e.g. access request,
access authorization, and access to assets.

The methodology behind the granting of access must work on the principle that “access
should be denied unless specifically permitted” and the principle of “least privilege” must
apply to restrict the access rights of users whether human or non-human.

Access shall be governed by the classification level of information and the requirement
for separation and segregation of duties. The higher the classification the more selective
the granting of access shall be.

Users must only be provided with access to the facilities and services that they have
been specifically authorized to use and permitted only where there is a specific need
taking account of any Legal and Contraction obligations that may apply. (Note:- Some
users may be permitted to carry out more than one major function, so are permitted to
take more than one “role”).

All users and applications must be authenticated to IT systems and his authentication
must identify them as individuals. (Note:- All access to POA Systems will be monitored).

Initial default accounts must be renamed where possible and initial default passwords
must always be replaced by secure passwords.

The safety and security, including confidentiality, of access credentials is the
responsibility of the each individual issued with the credentials and of those issuing the
credentials.

Help Desk Environment

.

Help Desks must maintain the information required to authenticate the callers and their
Branches/offices as required for the type of call. If the call needs to be passed onto
another internal POA help desk, the call must be forwarded only after the initial

authentication has been carried out.

e Wherever authorisation is given orally, normally over a telephone link, additional
verification methods must be used. This is achieved by asking callers to confirm their branch
code, post code and telephone number.

Third Party Considerations
«There must be a demonstrable need for Third Party access and all access to POA

information processing facilities by third parties must be controlled.

e  Arisk assessment must be carried out to determine the security implications and control
requirements for any forms of physical and electronic access by third parties.

« On-site third parties must be identified and documented.

e All security requirements resulting from third party access or internal controls must be
reflected in the third party contract. Where there is a special need for confidentiality of
the information, non-disclosure agreements must be used.

e Access to information and information processing facilities by third parties must not be
provided until the appropriate controls have been implemented and a contract has been
signed defining the terms for the connection or access.

11.1.1.4 Exceptions

e Any exceptions to the policy must be documented and signed off by the CISO.

Procedure (Ref:- ISN006654),

As documented in the Post Office Account User Access Procedure (Ref:- SVM/SEC/PRO/0012)
the User Access Process on the Account is based on the creation and control of a registry of all
personnel who work on the account.

This register is controlled by the Account Security Operations Team, and is maintained and
updated on a regular basis in line with requests being submitted and tracks all personnel working
on the account, the system access they have been given and any security clearance level that
they have been granted.

The user registry holds the information about each individual who has been granted access and
the systems that they have been granted access to. In addition it contains details of the
authoriser, approver and dates that this access was granted last reviewed and revoked

11.2.2 Privilege Management

The Post Office Account User Access Procedure (Ref:- SVM/SEC/PRO/0012) ensures users
access is reviewed, reported and audited to ensure that it is functioning effectively and
efficiently.

Specifically the POA Security Operations Team shall undertake a monthly review of the access
granted to individuals and its continued appropriateness:

« The POA Security Operations Team shall produce details of all users contained in the
registry and their access levels and shall email these to the relevant Line/Assignment
Managers.

e — Line/Assignment Managers shall review whether the current access of their employees
is still in line with their job role.

e Line/Assignment Managers shall consider whether any users require their access be
amended

e Line Mangers shall confirm each employee's current access rights requirements and
shall email these details to the POA Security Operations Team within 10 working days
of receipt of the original e-mail from CSPOA Security Operations Team.

If required the Operations Security Manager (OSM) shall provide a monthly update of Privilege

11.4 Network Access Control

11.4.1 Policy on Use of Network Services

The Post Office Account User Access Procedure (Ref:- SVM/SEC/PRO/0012) is controlled by
the POA Security Operations Team, and is maintained and updated on a regular basis in line
with requests being submitted and tracks all personnel working on the account, the system
access they have been given and any security clearance level that they have been granted.

The user registry holds the information about each individual who has been granted access and
the systems that they have been granted access to.

11.4.2 User Authentication for External Connections

11.4.2.1 Remote User Access Authentication

Remote users must use Microsoft Remote Desktop Client (RDP) in order to logon to AD domain
through the SSN terminal servers.

To log on to the network, the user must insert their token into the free USB port. Windows
recognizes insertion of the smart card into the reader, as an alternative to the standard
CTRL+ALT+DEL key sequence, to initiate a logon. The user is then prompted for their user PIN,
which controls access to his private data stored on the smart card. Since the PKI credentials
and/or passwords are stored on the card or token, the user can roam within the network,
providing scope for a very flexible deployment of systems and users.

Once logged into Windows network, Windows assigns a ticket to the user which grants access to
network resources based on user's role. User should no longer be challenged to provide their
user credentials for accessing any kerberized services.

Any attempt to start RDP session from a SAS/SSN server to another Microsoft Terminal Server,
challenges the user for authentication, as currently Microsoft does not support pass-through
authentication. In order to take advantage of pass-through authentication, commercial third party
products were considered, but rejected by the business.

11.4.2.2 Third Party Access

A number of third parties connect to the Data Centres using diverse connectivity mechanisms.
and not all are owned or managed by Fujitsu.

Third parties will connect to a Transit LAN. The Transit LAN is considered to be the boundary
between the HNG-X network and any externally administered organisation that HNG-X connects.
to. The transit LAN exists both for security and to provide an unambiguous demarcation between
HNG-X and that organisation.

This clearly defined demarcation is necessary to assist fault and service resolution, to facilitate
technical interface specification and to prevent administrative conflicts or inter-penetration
between HNG-X and an external organisations network.

This demarcation exists at the physical for routers or switches, at the logical for addressing and
routing and at the service level for the traffic between application endpoints that traverse it. The
Transit LAN should not be confused with the DMZ; the Transit LAN is the exposed and
unpopulated perimeter of the HNG-X network, beyond which no further controlled network
devices exist.

11.4.3 Equipment Identification in Networks

As described in HNG-X Technical Network Architecture (Ref:- ARC/NET/ARC/0001) the Network
protocol is IP Version 4 (RFC 791). The semantics of an IP address may be both locality and
identity. For example the Data Centre application interprets the source IP of an incoming TCP
connection from a branch as the identity of the endpoint and assumes persistence of this
identity. Conversely address pools are used in the case where the need to attribute identity does
not apply, for example PPP interface addresses for Wireless Wide Area Network (WAN).

For each 3° party with which HNG-X exchanges IP data grams a Peering IP address space is
defined. Each such Peering IP address space will either be under administrative control of the 3%
party or under HNG-X control and shall be specified in the relevant Technical Interface
document. It will also be defined / referenced in any OLA/SLA or contractual agreements for
mitigation purposes and incident management.

In the 3” party case they specify the address space. In the HNG-X case the IP address space is
allocated as for non-peering HNG-X IP addresses stated above.

11.4.4 Remote Diagnostic and Configuration Port Protection

In order to ensure that only authorised devices may be connected to any component of the HNG-
X system, (with the exception of passive devices within the Branch) all network devices will be
configured with either a static MAC address allowing only the authorised host to connect, or a
single-entry dynamic-learned MAC permission as documented in HNG-X Technical Network
Architecture (Ref:- ARC/NET/ARC/0001).

Prior to Live operation, all MAC addresses will be recorded and validated, and all ports not
connected will be administratively shut down. This position will be monitored with network
management event reporting.

11.4.5 Segregation in Networks

There are a number of defined security domains with the HNG-X security model and
therefore data traffic will always be either intra-domain traffic or inter-domain traffic.

The only permitted connections to the POA network must be:
« — Intra-domain traffic — Data traffic moving between systems in the same domain.
e — Inter-domain traffic - Data traffic moving between systems in different domains.

There is a third class of traffic consisting of data moving into and out of the HNG-X
infrastructure.

Intra-domain traffic may be unrestricted because the systems share a LAN segment, or may be

Inter-domain traffic must pass through an enforcement point that restricts data flow based on its
source, destination, protocol, port, type or content/format. This can be a firewall, router or other
in-line control point, such as an IPS system. (i.e. The control is physically part of the data path).

A network segment however, whether it is a logical or physical network segment, must be
entirely in a domain and cannot span domains. There is no restriction on the number of network
segments, firewalls or other network security controls that can be in a security domain.

The security domain model can therefore be viewed as a method of logically grouping network
subnets to assist in the development of Firewall and Router Access Lists.

Domains can also span physical locations. For example, the Key Management Domain contains
Data Centre systems as well as workstations in remote locations such as Bracknell and Lewes.

The use of this domain model ensures that network segmentation can be implemented to tightly
control communication to, from and between HNG-X platform instances.

Separation between environments is controlled using a combination of preventive and detective
controls such as access control, firewall rules, BladeFrame configuration, switch configuration
and event monitoring.

The HNG-X Platform Hardware Instance List (Ref:- DEV/GEN/SPE/0007) contains a definitive
mapping of platform instances to security domains.

11.4.6 Network Connection Control

Within each Data Centre, the HNG-X network is segmented following the Security Domain
model as documented in HNG-X Architecture — Security Architecture (Ref:-
ARC/SEC/ARC/0003).

The security domain model provides a framework for the network architecture and designs,
such that the flow of data around the network is controlled following the principle of least
privilege.

The purpose of network segmentation is to reduce the scope of any potential attack. By
restricting the ‘attack surface’ to a limited number of systems, any damage caused as a
consequence of an attack, can be kept to a minimum.

The network segmentation is achieved using a combination of physical and virtual controls.
Dependent on the Security Domain and any specific contractual agreements with third parties,
the network segmentation is enforced using VLANs, Stateful Inspection Firewalls, Access
Control Lists and physical separation.

Each different network media type is authenticated using a dedicated RADIUS server instance
for network device access, with different Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol
credentials per Branch Router.

Each human support user accessing a network device is authenticated using the Identity and
Access Management Service.

11.4.7 Network Routing Control

All access in and out of the HNG-X environment must be restricted to the required traffic from/to
the authorised sources/destinations for business and system traffic using routers and firewalls.

The HNG-X network is divided into 11 Security Domains. The term Security Domain is defined
to mean a collection of platforms and network components grouped together based on type,
perceived vulnerability and risk rating. Even so, it may be necessary to restrict traffic between
platforms in a common Security Domain (intra-domain traffic) through the implementation of

logical separation, (using VLANs), or physical separation, (using separate network segments in
the same domain).

Any traffic which crosses network domain (inter-domain traffic) boundaries must pass through an

enforcement point that restricts data flow based on its source, destination, protocol, port, type or

content/format. This can be a firewall, router or other in-line control point, such as an IPS
system. (i.e. The control is physically part of the data path).

The Domain structure places a logical ring around the logical Security Perimeter of the HNGx
Network in the Data Centres, but this perimeter extends beyond the Data Centre in some cases.
More specifically, this perimeter can be best described as the collection of devices managed (or
monitored) by Fujitsu Services, At the boundary of these managed devices a firewall (hardware
or software-based) will be located, and the perimeter will be secured according to firewall
guidelines laid out in HNG-X Technical Network Architecture (Ref:- ARC/NET/ARC/0001).

11.5 Operating System Access Control

11.5.1. Secure Log-on Procedures

Access to operating systems will be controlled by in-build Operating Systems procedures that
request the user to log-on using approved, valid credentials.

HNG-X Architecture —- Security Architecture (Ref:- ARC/SEC/ARC/0003) describes that all
human access to any component of a platform will be controlled using strong authentication. The
strong authentication solution uses the Vintella Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) module
from Quest Software to enable UNIX and Linux systems to become objects in Active Directory.

A hardware security token is also used, in conjunction with Active Directory, which uses a
combination of the hardware token, public key cryptography and a user passphrase to provide
secure authentication.

Before a user can access the system, they must have been provided with a security token,
containing the appropriate credentials, by the security manager.

11.5.2 User Identification and Authentication

As captured in HNG-X Architecture — Security Architecture (Ref:- ARC/SEC/ARC/0003) the
Horizon-Online environment is managed using an Active Directory tree which controls access to
resources through the Windows 2003 Kerberos and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
implementations.

UNIX and Linux systems are managed through the same Active Directory tree utilising a PAM
installed on each UNIX system.

Database access is managed through the implementation of scripts to create database users.
This approach means that a role-based access control matrix will be created for each database
using a standard set of roles across all databases.

Interactive access to a database will be controlled by the directory service in the following way.
Access to a SQL Server database on a Microsoft platform instance will use native authentication
and the user will therefore effectively have already been authenticated when the logged into the
Active Directory domain. Access to an Oracle database will use the ops$_<username> concept
which passes authentication of the user to the underlying operating system. This also means that
the user needs a strong authentication token to logon to the Active Directory domain, prior to
connecting to the database.

However, in each of these cases, the users username and access rights within the database will
have been setup externally to Active Directory and will be managed using a script-driven manual
process.

Access to a database over the network, (such as from an application or from a management
tool), will be controlled through a combination of database access rights and network
permissions. In all cases, over the network access to any database will still require that the user
be setup within the database and access permissions provided accordingly. Users of any
management tool will also have needed to authenticate themselves to Active Directory prior to
using the tool.

11.5.3 Password Management System

Passwords within the HNG-X environment are managed as per Microsoft standards within Active
Directory (as previously mentioned in the HNG-X Architecture — Security Architecture (Ref:-

ARC/SEC/ARC/0003).

following:

Enforce a choice of quality passwords

Enforce password changes

Force users to change temporary passwords at the first log-on
Maintain a record of previous user passwords and prevent re-use
Passwords not displayed on the screen when being entered

By design Microsoft Active Directory will ensure passwords are stored securely and not
transmitted in an unencrypted form.

11.5.4 Use of System Utilities

Management domains using system management applications will also provide access and role
control appropriate to the operational functions they offer.

Where appropriate, this will utilise the capabilities of Active Directory.

This is defined in the HNG-X System and Estate Management Overall Architecture
{ARC/SYM/ARC/0001}.

11.5.5 Session Time-out

The Fujitsu UK & Ireland Business Management System Security Policy Manual states that
Fujitsu UK&I will time out sessions and automatically log out the user if no activity is detected
after a pre-defined length of time.

11.5.5.1 Microsoft Remote Desktop Client (RDP) Connections

The Microsoft Remote Desktop Client used the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to logon to AD
domain through the SSN terminal servers has a session time-out set of 15 minutes of inactivity.

11.5.6 Limitation of Connection Time

Fujitsu UK&I will provide restrictions on connection times at the application level where

necessary.

11.6 Application and Information Access Control

11.6.1 Information Access Restriction

A key principle with the HNG-X Architecture — Security Architecture (Ref:- ARC/SEC/ARC/0003)
is that of Least Privilege

Access must be provided using the principle of “that which is not explicitly granted is denied” or
a “default deny”, by only granting the permissions necessary to carry out the action being
performed. These permissions include application, platform, network and management, (through
policy and process), or any combination necessary to perform the action.

This approach assumes that, subject to risk assessment and given the limitations of an operating
system or other software, any entity such as a user, an application, a device or an object within
application code has no permissions to perform any action before permissions are granted. This
assumes that the default configuration of all systems is to deny access. It is very important to
ensure that the permissions matrix is developed correctly to ensure that all entities have the
access they need to perform their function.

11.6.2 Sensitive System Isolation

The HNG-X Architecture — Security Architecture (Ref:- ARC/SEC/ARC/0003) describes the
principles of Security Tiers and Domains to reduce the likelihood of a compromise and to ensure
that a compromise of one Platform Instance does not immediately result in the compromise of
the entire estate and campus. This model groups together platforms based on type, perceived
vulnerability and risk rating.

There are three tiers in this model, adopting the standard architecture for web applications, with
the most exposed platforms in Tier 1 and the least exposed in Tier 3. Exposed, in this context,
means the type of connection the platform instance has with the outside world.

A security domain model has been designed to effectively segregate the HNG-X infrastructure,
such that systems with a similar criticality level are grouped together and systems exposed to a
similar level of risk are grouped together.

Traffic passing between security domains must be controlled to only allow the relevant protocol
and port necessary for the service being accessed.

12 Information Systems Acquisition, Development
and Maintenance

12.1 Security Requirements of Information Systems

12.1.1. Security Requirements Analysis and Specification

No one approach to software development will meet the needs of every project. The influence of
the customer, the project size, the teams experience and location are among many factors that
must be acknowledged in defining the most productive process for a project.

Fujitsu uses an architectural approach to methodologies. Recognising that all methodologies
address a common set of concerns, Fujitsu has a methodology framework which allows a
project-specific methodology to be dynamically created from a set of predefined "best practices"
which provide the most appropriate approach to meeting the project's needs.

Apt is a flexible Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) framework within which specific
methodologies can be composed from predefined practices, and within which the most
appropriate tools can be combined to support the project practitioners.

Waterfall is a sequential and structured approach to software development that enables linear
solution progression through discrete, thorough and easily understood phases.

12.1.1.1 HNG-X Design & Build Methodology

The HNG-X Design & Build Methodology (HNGxDBM) lifecycle complements the Fujitsu UK&!
BMS ADBM Build and Unit Test (Ref:- CADBM1.2) and Waterfall approach.

The HNG-X Design & Build Methodology Requirements and Design (HNGxDBM) process (Ref:-
PGM/PAS/PRO/0002) defines the activities required for the Post Office Account to understand,
confirm and document the Post Offices’ and internal requirements for the new application
development in sufficient detail that a correct and valid solution can be built.

Once all the Business Requirements are analysed a Design Proposal is created using the Design
Proposal Template (DES/GEN/TEM/2213).

This will be a description of the design which will:-
¢ Describe the business and service outcomes that this solution must deliver
e Provide a high level description of the proposed technical and operational solution

e Support dialogue with the Business and Service Requirements stakeholders in order to
demonstrate compliance to their requirements.

e Identify the primary technologies that will be used to deliver the solution

« Elaborate on the areas of business change and their impact on the HNG-X Solution and
Services

e Identify any impact on the existing HNG-X Architecture and core Solution Designs
e Identify the how the Functional and Non-Functional requirements will be met
e Identify the nature of any Security solution changes

e Identify the nature of any impact on existing contractual obligations or measures

12.3 Cryptographic Controls

12.3.1 Policy on the Use of Cryptographic Controls

Services will comply with Post Office Cryptographic standards, contractual and relevant
regulatory requirements, including PCI-DSS, for the handing of cryptographic key material and
staff are to follow all UK and European standards regulations and directive detailing where and
how encryption algorithms may be used as captured in the HNG-X Crypto Services HLD (Ref:-
DES/SEC/HLD/0002)

Government specified algorithms and key lengths must be used where POL identifies that they
are specifically required by HM Government.

e All cryptographic key lengths shall be at least 128 bits for symmetric keys and at least
1024 bits for asymmetric keys where the associated cryptographic control protects the
integrity or confidentiality of Horizon Online Business Data, Reference Data or
Application Software.

e PCI requirements state that for PCI Card holder data all Keys shall be AES 256 or TDES
128 bit TDES in length.

Approved keys must be protected in line with Government Specified Algorithms requirements as
directed by POL Ltd.

Digital signatures provide a means of protecting the authenticity and integrity of electronic
documents. All keys used for signing data must be afforded levels of protection equal to or
greater than the highest levels of data signed.

Encryption key management must be independent of network configuration such that the
confidentiality of POL traffic is not compromised by a single configuration error of either the
WAN or the encryption system.

All cryptographic keys must be protected against unauthorised use, modification, loss, and
destruction. In addition, secret and private keys need protection against unauthorized disclosure.

Equipment used to generate, store and archive keys must be physically protected.

It must be possible to recover the system to a secure operating state from the compromise of
any key that could directly or indirectly expose plain text PIN values.

12.3.2 Key Management

A structured approach to Key Management will be implemented across all Services provided to
POL and is described in more detail in the HNG-X Key Management High Level Design (Ref:-
DES/SEC/HLD/0003) and the HNG-X Key Management Support Guide (Ref:-
DES/APP/SPG/0004).

The HNG-X Key Management solution has simplified Key Management for the Post Office. The
HNG-X Key Management system replaces the Horizon Key Management.

12.3.2.1 Keys

Keys are managed using the HNG-X Key Management Workstation (on the KSN platform),
stored on the NPS database and fetched from the NPS database via the Key Service (KSS
application on the KMN platform) to the Key Service Client (KSC) located on the various HNG-X

business application platforms (e.g. Network Banking Services). The KSC passes the keys to
the Crypto Application Programming Interface (API) for use by the business applications.

12.3.2.2 Master File Key

The Master File Key is protected by being stored on the networked HSM (Hardware Security
Module) devices introduced for HNG-X. New functionality is introduced at HNG-X to enable the
networked HSMs to be shared and used by the business applications that require PAN
encryption and decryption services. The business application's Crypto APIs use the HSM Access
Service API to access the HSMs. The HSMs are used with the Secure Configuration Assistance
and the Key Management Workstation to generate the AKB keys.

12.3.2.3. Traffic Keys

The delivery includes sensitive keys protected by Traffic Keys (TK) specific to the key
destination. The TKs themselves are unprotected and must be delivered to each target server
by a separate secure mechanism (ie:- delivered manually via a key disk or stored on NPS and
delivered by the KSC/KSS mechanism).. In both cases the TK is requested by a Key Store
Service at server start-up and held by that service for use within the Horizon-specific
cryptographic layer..

12.4.1 Control of Operational Software

The HNG-X Design & Build Methodology Integration Process (Ref:- PGM/PAS/PRO/0009)
describes the activities undertaken to collect and prepare system components that are to be
released into the test or live environment.

This process is applicable to integration and release activities during the HNG-X development
project and will be reviewed and updated to reflect the different constraints applicable to
integration and release in a live environment at that time.

Furthermore, Fujitsu personnel engaged in the provision of the Services to the POA must only
use proprietary software within the terms of the licence conditions. Unauthorised copying or
distribution of software and documentation is prohibited.

The Account configuration management system will maintain an inventory of all proprietary
software used by all services.

The Account Change Management Processes must be utilised at all times to ensure that no
changes are made to operational software without authorisation and a regression facility.

12.4.2 Protection of System Test Data

All test data and test cases for POA services will be stored in a change control system and will
be protected and controlled as captured in HNG-X DBM System Design, Code, Build &
Component Test Process (Ref:- PGM/PAS/PRO/0003)

Operational databases or live data must not be used for testing purposes. Where live
information needs to be used, for testing realism the data will be sanitised, where possible,
before being used in the test environment.

Operational information will be securely erased from test application systems immediately after
the testing is complete.

12.4.3. Access Control to Program Source Code

The HNG-X Design & Build Methodology Implementation & Support Documentation Process

Manage Change Policy (Ref: SM-3) and Manage Change Process (Ref: C-MSv1.5).

Information Security is an integral component of the POA Change Management function and is
evidenced by the Account Security Management participation in Change Boards (PCCB & CCB).

The CCB has the total authority and responsibility to accept, reject or defer a Change Proposal
(CP) irrespective of its origination (Customer or Internal) and as such acts on behalf of the POA
Management Team.

12.5.2 Technical Review of Applications after Operating System
Changes

Prior to any operating system upgrade or change, a review of all application control and integrity
procedures must be carried out to ensure that they cannot be compromised by the proposed
changes.

The HNG-X Design & Build Methodology Integration Process (Ref:- PGM/PAS/PRO/0009)
describes the activities undertaken to collect and prepare system components that are to be
released into the test or live environment.

When operating systems are changed, business critical applications shall be reviewed and
tested to ensure there is no adverse impact on organizational operations or security.

A roll-back capability must be included in any change.

12.5.3 Restrictions on Changes to Software Packages

The security strategy outlined in HNG-X Architecture — Security Architecture (Ref:-
ARC/SEC/ARC/0003) is that in order to reduce complexity and implementation times, the
approach taken for security applications and services is to use internal Fujitsu services when
appropriate and to buy and integrate COTS products rather than develop them internally.

Specific exceptions to this rule have been made in the area of cryptography and key
management where the solution has been redeveloped for the cryptographic API, (Ref:-
DES/SEC/HLD/0002), and a key management solution has been developed in the absence of
commercial alternatives.

12.5.4 Information Leakage

12.5.4.1 Obfuscation of Logs

The End to End Application Support Strategy (Ref:- SVM/SDM/PRO/0875) stipulates that certain
log files must be processed to obscure personal details that exist within before they can be
passed to support teams outside the European Union.

As new log files are generated by system enhancements development units need to be aware of
the Data Protection Act (DPA) and ensure that information in any new log files is either benign in
DPA terms or that appropriate changes are made to the obfuscation tool.

Areas currently identified as potentially containing personal data are captured in Obfuscation of
Counter/BAL-OSR Data For 4LS (Ref:- DES/APP/DPR/0008) and include

e Counter OSR / BAL message log file
e Counter application log file
« Database exports (e.g. CSV exports - Message Journal Exports)
e Screen captures of live system data*
e Audit data extracts (content of message journal)*
*Not handled by obfuscation tool

In order to allow the use of such information offshore an obfuscation tool has been developed for
use on the log files that are known to contain sensitive information before passing to any
external support team. The tool has now been integrated into Peak.

12.5.4.2 Obfuscation Tool

The HNG-X Tool for Obfuscation of Counter/BAL-OSR Data: Support Guide (Ref:-
DEV/GEN/SPG/0023) document gives guidance on the use and support of the Counter and HBS
Obfuscation Tool.

The delivered tool includes the rules required to obfuscate all log files identified in Obfuscation of
Counter/BAL-OSR Data for 4LS (DES/APP/DPR/0008):-

e« Counter message log
e BAL message log
e Counter Post Office Counter log
e Database dump file brdb_rx_rep_session_data.cvs
« HBS Message log
e HBS Application log
Audit logs are not supported by this tool.

Although sensitive data is already obfuscated to comply with PCI when generated, this tool will
be used to remove personal identification data that may be logged according to PCI but which
must not be sent offshore to India. An individual piece of data may not be sufficient alone to
identify a person but combined with other data might be.

The tool obfuscates any individual piece of data that might, in combination with other data,
identify a person although it does not check whether any other such data exists.

12.6 Technical Vulnerability Management

12.6.1 Control of Technical Vulnerabilities

The vulnerability management service ensures security patches and updates are maintained at
the appropriate level. The service provides secure platform builds that have been hardened to
reduce the vulnerability of the standard platform. The service provides protection against
malware in the form of Viruses, Trojans, and Worms etc. and detects and prevents malicious
code and malicious activity on the network. This service supplies the assurance that possible
platform and application vulnerabilities have been reduced to a minimum.

The following facilities are supplied by the service;
e Provides System Hardening

e Provides Vulnerability Management.
e Provides Patch Management.

« Provides Malware Management.

¢ Controls Vulnerabilities within HNG-X.

The vulnerability management service consists of a number of components that work together to
identify and reduce vulnerabilities in HNG-X. This includes vulnerabilities caused by
configuration errors as well as software bugs.

12.6.1.1 Vulnerability Scanning

The McAfee Foundstone vulnerability scanning appliance will be deployed into each Data
Centre. This appliance will be configured to scan all systems, (including network devices), on a
regular basis.

The scanner will always be configured to run non-destructive scans but will be configured with
appropriate credentials, on the scanned platform, to enable in-depth Operating System scanning.

Reports will be produced from the vulnerability scanning server as input to the audit process and
for analysis by the Security Operations Team.

The vulnerability scanner will be used as a security testing tool during the development phases
of the HNG-X project.

The design of the vulnerability scanning server is covered in the HNG-X Vulnerability
Management HLD (DES/SEC/HLD/0008)

12.6.1.2 Patch Management

To reduce vulnerability to exploitation and ensure that all systems within the HNG-X
environment have the relevant and appropriate patches applied within a reasonable timeframe,
there will be a patch management system described in full in the HNG-X Patch Management
Process (Ref:- SVM/SEC/PRO/0009) with the design for the patch management system is
described in the HNG-X Patch Management HLD (Ref:- DES/SEC/HLD/0006).

This system will provide mechanisms for
e Gathering patches and updates to major operating systems and applications
e Evaluating and filtering the patches and updates
e Testing the patches and updates

e Deploying the patches and updates.

The Patch Approval Board is a virtual team that meets monthly and reviews the HNG-X Patch
Deployment Spreadsheet and seeks agreement on the patch set to be deployed and in what
timescale for example an emergency fix or include at next release.

The team is able to use the criteria established by the manufacturer of the product to assist in
making its decision, these take account of the following:

¢ How likely it is that the vulnerability will affect the operating systems, applications,
databases, or network equipment.

e¢ How easy or difficult it is for someone to make use of the vulnerability and use it to
create a threat to the POA operating systems, applications, databases, or network
equipment, its simplicity.

« The severity of the damage that can occur if this patch is not applied its impact.

The filtered patches will then go through LST testing and be distributed to the target platforms
using the Tivoli software distribution mechanism.

Data integrity of each patch or update, (and of software distribution in general), is assured using
a file hashing mechanism. This does not give the same level of protection as a digital signature,
but in conjunction with the other policy, procedure and technical security controls, it assures that
the software installed is the software delivered by the configuration and release management
system.

Due to the technical and management security controls in place throughout the Horizon-Online
infrastructure, there is considered to be a greater threat from the installation of corrupted code
than that from malicious code.

The software distribution mechanism is described in detail in HNG-X System and Estate
Management Software Distribution and Asset Management (Ref:- ARC/SYM/ARC/0002)

13 Information Security Incident Management
13.1 Reporting Information Security Events and Weaknesses

13.1.1 Reporting Information Security Incidents

An Information Security Incident is defined as "an adverse event or series of events that
compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of POA information or information
technology assets, having an adverse impact on Fujitsu reputation, brand, performance or ability
to meet its regulatory or legal obligations."

Information security events must be reported through the POA Service desk as required by the
Security Incident Reporting Process described in the POA Operations Incident Management
Procedure (Ref:- SVM/SDM/PRO/0018), or via 7799 for supporting systems in accordance with
Fujitsu UK&l BMS Security Incident Process (Ref:- I-IS1.1) as quickly as possible. This Process
also state that it is an incidents arising from Fujitsu Corporate assets that may affect the support
of POA must be reported to the Operational Security Manager.

Incidents that threaten Cardholder Data and Sensitive Authentication Data must also be acted
upon as outlined in the POA Operations Incident Management Procedure.

All security incidents reported to the Service Desk must be logged and given a reference and
handled in accordance with the incident management process.

All POA Staff will be made aware of their responsibility to report any information security events
and suspected breaches as quickly as possible.

13.1.2 Reporting Security Weaknesses

It is recognised by the POA Security Management Team that no system can be 100% secure
and the POA may be vulnerable to unknown Security Weaknesses.

As required by the Fujitsu UK&!l BMS Security Policy Manual if POA staff identify or suspect that
a security weakness exists anywhere in the systems being supported by the Account (including
any identified by the Vulnerability Management Service), then they must report these matters to
the Account Security Management Team via Line Management at the earliest opportunity in
order to prevent Information Security Incidents.

All staff must be aware that they should not, in any circumstances, attempt to prove a suspected
weakness themselves. If such a course of action resulted in a security Incident then it may be
treated as a disciplinary issue.

13.2 Management of Information Security Incidents and
Improvements

13.2.1 Responsibilities and Procedures

The management of Incidents is captured in the POA Operations Incident Management
Procedure (Ref:- SVM/SDM/PRO/0018). This procedure identifies some key roles within the
POA _ for Information Security Incident Management:

13.2.1.1 Service Desk Agent

The Service Desk Agents provide a single point of contact for users, dealing with the
management of routine and non- routine Incidents, Problems and Requests.

13.2.1.2 Incident Manager

The Incident Manager's principle responsibility is to drive the Incident Management process,
monitor its effectiveness and make recommendations for improvement. The key objective is to
ensure that service is improved through the efficient resolution of Incidents.

13.2.1.3 Incident Resolver

The Incident Resolver is to accurately diagnose and resolve Incidents and Problems within SLA,
and to assess, plan, build/test and implement Changes in accordance with the Change
Management Process. This role will typically be fulfilled by the support teams and service
delivery units

13.2.2 Learning from Information Security Incidents

The POA Quality Management and Security Review Board (QMSR) which meets quarterly will
be the forum for evaluating and conducting any lessons learnt from Information Security
Incidents.

Findings shall be incorporated into the Information Security Policy review and potentially
escalated to the ISMF.

13.2.3 Collection of Evidence

The POA Operations Incident Management Procedure (Ref:- SVM/SDM/PRO/0018) describes
that where a follow-up action against a person or organisation after an Information Security
incident involves or may involve legal action (either civil or criminal), evidence will be collected,
retained, and presented to conform to the rules for evidence laid down in the relevant
jurisdiction(s). Legal action may also be initiated by 3° parties e.g. by regulatory bodies or
controllers of potentially compromised sensitive information.

Should it be considered necessary the incident might be passed to an external investigator or
forensics team, who will ensure that any data required for evidential purposes is captured and
investigated using a systematic approach which ensures that an auditable record of evidence is
maintained and can be retrieved

In some cases, where a compromise to card data is involved, two Forensic Investigation teams

may be involved. One team operating on behalf of POL gathering the required audit logs to use
to analyse and investigate the problem. A second Forensic Investigations team may be imposed
to investigate on behalf of the card acquirer and card schemes. In all incidences where a

Forensic Investigation is involved, the Forensic Investigators will be shadowed by POL's Legal
and Security Teams.

Incident investigation procedures must ensure that evidence is collected such that it is
admissible and of sufficient weight by keeping original documents, copies of information held on
hard discs, removable media and log files.

13.2.3.1 Audit Track Retrieval and Analysis

The Horizon (On-Line) Architecture — Support Service (Ref:- ARC/SVS/ARC/0001) describes in
detail that the outputs of Audit Track retrieval is initiated by a request (either from within Fujitsu
Services or Post Office) for access to audit data. This data may be provided either in its raw
form, i.e. a simple copy of the Audit Track files or may be subject to some filtering and analysis
by authorised Post Office Account staff before being sent back to the requestor.

Audit Track retrieval and analysis are services are provided to users by the Audit Extractor
Client application on the Audit workstation. The audit client application interacts with the Audit
servers to perform certain actions.

In summary the workstation supports the following end user services:
« Management and Monitoring of Audit Record Queries (ARQs)
¢ Online extraction of data from the Audit Archive
e Seal Checking to ensure extracted files have seals intact
e Server based tools to filter Audit Tracks
e Workstation based tools to analyze and present audit data in required format
e Decryption of encrypted PANs relating to Banking or Debit/Credit card transactions

The vast majority of Audit Track retrieval requests are for Post Office branch transaction and
event data. Thus the services provided on the Audit workstation are optimized to handle these
types of request.

The Audit Extractor Client is implemented as a Microsoft Visual Basic 6 application.

More detail of the design of Audit track Retrieval and Analysis is available in Audit Data
Retrieval High Level Design (DES/APP/HLD/0029).

14 BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT
14.1 Information Security aspects of Business Continuity

14.1.1 Including Information Security in the Business Continuity
Management Process

Fujitsu are committed to Business Continuity as demonstrated by the Fujitsu UK&l BMS
Business Continuity Master Policy (Ref:- CPM31).

This Corporate policy advocates that actual or potential Major/Serious incidents that may affect
the Activities that support Fujitsu UK and Ireland key products and services by preparing,
maintaining and testing Business Continuity Plans (using the Manage Continuity of Fujitsu UK &
Ireland Business Process (Ref:- I-AB 1.9)), executing those plans, when business interruptions
occur and proactively reducing the impact that incidents will have on the Activities and the key
products and services, where it is appropriate to do so.

The POA Business Continuity Manager is responsible for ensuring that a process is implemented
to minimize the impact on the Account and delivery of services and recover from loss of
information assets. This process will identify the critical business processes and integrate the
Information Security management requirements of Account business operations with other
continuity requirements.

The HNG-X Business Continuity Framework (Ref:- SVM/SDM/SIP/0001) recognises that a
principle requirement specified within schedule B2 of The Agreement is the provision of
Business Continuity Plans which conform to an overall ‘Service Continuity Framework’ which
include Information Security.

The POA CISO and / or the Information Security Risk and Assurance Lead will be involved in
the development and maintenance of the processes, and any continuity plans, by contributing as
a reviewer on any changes to any Business Continuity Plans, to ensure that Information Security
requirements are adequately addressed.

The Account Security Management Team shall also send representation to the Post office
Infrastructure, Networks and Business Continuity Operational Review Forum.

14.1.2 Business Continuity and Information Security Risk
Assessment

Events that can cause interruptions to business processes shall be identified in Business
Continuity Tests.

The likelihood and impact of such interruptions and any consequences for Information Security
shall be recorded in accordance with the HNG-X Information Security Risk Management
Procedure (Ref:- SVM/SEC/PRO/0033).

A coordinated approach between Business Continuity and the Account Security Team is required
to measure the Information Security Risk exposure.

14.1.3 Developing and Implementing Continuity Plans including
Information Security
The POA Business Continuity Manager must ensure that effective business continuity plans are

agreed and maintained. The POA Security Management Team under the direction of the CISO
should ensure that Information Security is an integral part of the overall business continuity

process to reduce the risks from deliberate or accidental threats to deny access to vital services
or information including deliberate loss of confidentiality and integrity of POA assets.

The HNG-X Business Continuity Framework (Ref:- SVM/SDM/SIP/0001) captures that there
shall be four Continuity Plans for HNG-X and by definition Information Security will have a
footprint is all of the following:

« HNG-X Services Business Continuity Plan (Ref:- SVM/SDM/PLA/0002)

« HNG-X Support Services Business Continuity Plan (Ref:- SVM/SDM/PLA/0001)

e HNG-X Security Business Continuity Plan (Ref:- SVM/SDM/PLA/0031)

e HNG-X Engineering Service Business Continuity Plan (Ref:- SVM/SDM/PLA/0030)

These plans must be maintained, to enable internal operations and business services to be
maintained following failure or damage to vital services, facilities or information.

14.1.4 Business Continuity Planning Framework

The POA maintains a framework of Business Continuity Plans in HNG-X Business Continuity
Framework (Ref:- SVM/SDM/SIP/0001).

The Business Continuity Framework defines the methodology agreed between Fujitsu Services
(Post Office Account) and POL for handling all aspects of Business Continuity.

It is the objective of the HNG-X Business Continuity Framework and associated Business
Continuity Plans to satisfy both Contractual and internal Corporate requirements for Business.
Continuity as required by Fujitsu UK&l BMS Business Continuity Master Policy (Ref:- CPM31).

The HNG-X Business Continuity Framework covers the following areas.

e Provide a baseline definition of the Business Continuity Framework and Business
Continuity Plans as specified in Schedule B2.

e Provide a detailed definition of Fujitsu Services (POA) deliverables associated with
business continuity and the methods of review and assurance.

e Define the contents and format of the Business Continuity Plans.
e Define the overall test strategy adopted for testing of the Business Continuity Plans.

e Define the management processes for the management of Major Business Continuity
Incidents.

14.1.5 Testing, Maintaining and Re-assessing Business Continuity
Plans

Schedule B2 of the ‘Agreement’ requires that there are contingency plans in place for the HNG-X
‘Applicable Services’ and Schedule 1 defines ‘Applicable Services’.

The strategy adopted by the POA Business Continuity Manager is to deliver the requirement of
testing ‘Applicable Services’ by verifying the operational continuity of the HNG-X operational
services and related infrastructure.

This testing will provide the necessary assurance that all possible business continuity risks have
been identified and that appropriate plans are in place to mitigate against such risks.

The HNG-X Business Continuity Test Plan (Ref:- SVM/SDM/PLA/0003) brings together the
testing requirements of all Post Office Account Business Continuity plans and documents the
schedule and methodology to be adopted for both initial and on-going tests.

The POA Business Continuity Management Team produces an annual Business Continuity Test
Schedule Planner (Ref:- NSN). Tests will be conducted either through procedural walk-through or

15 COMPLIANCE
15.1 Compliance with Legal Requirements

15.1.1 Identification of Applicable Legislation

As documented in Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct Global Business Standards (Paragraph 2)
Fujitsu are required to comply with legislative requirements and technical and commercial
standards in its own right as a business organisation.

The Fujitsu Post Office Account (POA) is required to ensure that it is compliant with
requirements placed upon it by its stakeholders.

Stakeholders cascade policies, standards, contractual and legislative requirements onto POA
and POA is then required to capture these and manage how it will implement them through a
series of controls or rules. POA is also required to monitor and measure how successful the
implementation of these controls are and based on these results to review them.

The extensive remit of the obligations placed on POA requires an overall strategy and
framework so that the Account can manage all its compliance requirements.

The Quality and Compliance Framework (Ref:- PGM/PAS/MAN/0004) identifies key areas
needed to ensure it meets the obligations of its stakeholders and they are planned, operated,
managed, monitored and reviewed.

To supply services to POL POA uses shared resources from within the whole of Fujitsu;
therefore POA is mandated to follow the frameworks, process and procedures documented by
Fujitsu Governance & Compliance, Fujitsu Quality Management and Fujitsu Development
Assurance.

Inputs to the Quality and Compliance framework can be broken down into the following areas:
e Legislation & Regulations
* Customer Standards
e Fujitsu Standards
« POA Standards

These are the building blocks of governance as they are the basis for all controls that POA must
build into its solutions, services, management and reviews.

POA stakeholders are the sources of these requirements and are individuals and organizations
which affect the support or provision of POA services to POL and its other customers.

Advice and guidance on Fujitsu’s legal responsibilities is provided by Fujitsu Group Legal

department.

15.1.2 Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)

Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct Global Business Standards (Paragraph 4) captures Fujitsu’s
commitment to protect IPR.

The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 states “The owner of the copyright has the
exclusive right to copy the work." It is illegal to copy software without the copyright owner's
permission.

Proprietary software must be used within the terms of the licence conditions and unauthorised
copying of software and documentation is prohibited.

Where practicable the POA will use vendor-supplied software packages without any
modifications. However, if changes are deemed necessary, these should first be requested and
agreed within the Account and then only implemented under agreement with the original
supplier.

Whilst it would be preferably that the changed software should be issued as an upgrade from the
supplier it is recognised that any bespoke modifications may be outside the supplier's software
lifecycle.

The POA will not permit any unauthorised modified or non-standard software components to be
incorporated.

An inventory of all proprietary software used by the Services will be maintained.

15.1.3 Data Retention and Protection of Organisational Records

As captured in Fujitsu's Documentation and Record Standards (Ref:- Group/Q&BE/03) a record
is defined by ISO 9000 as being “a document stating results achieved or providing evidence of
activities performed” that can be used to document traceability and provide evidence of
verification, preventive and corrective action.

Records stored electronically and hard copy retained for the contractual period will be accessible
throughout the required retention period and will be safeguarded against loss due to future
technology change as referenced in the Audit Trail Specification CR/FSP/006.

Data will be retrievable to meet legal requirements as requested by a court of law, e.g. records
required can be retrieved in an acceptable timeframe and in an acceptable format.

15.1.4 Data Protection and Privacy of Personal Data

It is Fujitsu’ clearly stated policy to comply with all laws and regulations relating to the protection
of personal data in all countries in which it transacts business and to maintain a high standard of
compliance in all its worldwide operations as captured in Data Protection Master Policy (CPM
36).

All applications handling personal data on individuals must comply with data protection
legislation and principles. POA shall process personal data only in accordance with the
instructions of each Data Controller as set out in the Agreement and applicable provisions of
CCDs dealing with such processing.

15.1.5 Prevention of Misuse of Information Processing Facilities
It is a clearly stated Fujitsu Policy that users shall be deterred from using information processing

facilities for unauthorized purposes as captured in Fujitsu UK & Ireland Business Management
System Security Policy Manual and the policy on the Acceptable Use of IT Within Fujitsu

Services.

15.2 Compliance with Security Policies and Standards and
Technical Compliance

15.2.1 Compliance with Security Policies and Standards

Compliance with the requirements defined in the POA Information Security Policy is mandatory.
The policy is to be applied throughout POA for the secure management and operation of all
systems and Services designed, built, implemented, operated, used, supplied or managed by the
Fujitsu POL Account.

Regular audits are carried out under the direction of POA CISO and/or POA Programme
Assurance Manager, to verify that POA is operating in accordance with its security policy and
procedures.

Security Audits can also be initiated by POL, its clients or regulators either in response to a
specific incident or on a regular basis.

These audits will form part of an overall assurance programme and will be scheduled, co-
ordinated, reported and corrective action plans acted on as part of an Integrated Audit Schedule
(Ref:- PGM/PAS/PLA/0014) which is maintained by the POA Quality Manager.

Where relevant, POA will comply with customer security requirements as expressed in the
Community Information Security Policy.

15.2.2 Technical Compliance Checking

POA information systems must be regularly checked for compliance with security
implementation standards and regulatory requirements.

Technical compliance checking involves the examination of operational systems to ensure that
hardware and software controls have been correctly implemented and is a requirement of The
Quality and Compliance Framework (Ref:- PGM/PAS/MAN/0004).

This type of compliance checking requires specialist technical assistance. It shall be performed
manually (supported by appropriate software tools, if necessary) by an experienced system
engineer, or by an automated software package which generates a technical report for
subsequent interpretation by a technical specialist.

Compliance checking also covers, for example, penetration testing, which might be carried out
by independent experts specifically contracted for this purpose. Caution should be exercised in
case success of a penetration test could lead to a compromise of the security of the system and
inadvertently exploit other vulnerabilities.

Any technical compliance check shall only be carried out by, or under the supervision of,
competent persons authorised by the Account CISO.

Technical compliance checking will form part of an overall assurance programme and will be
scheduled and co-ordinated as part of the Integrated Audit Schedule (Ref:- PGM/PAS/PLA/0014)
which is maintained by the POA Quality Manager.

15.3 Information Systems Audit Considerations

15.3.1 Information System Audit Controls

Fujitsu Services are required to provide facilities to store audit data and subsequently present it
for analysis as described in the Horizon (On-Line) Architecture - Support Services (Ref:-
ARC/SVS/ARC/0001).

This is in support of the audit requirements laid down for HNG-X Technical Security Architecture
(Ref:- ARC/SEC/ARC/0003).

Audit data may be requested by a number of different end users, for a number of different
reasons. These include:

e Post Office Auditors in connection with Fraud investigations — in which case the data
may be presented as evidence in court

« Fujitsu Services Post Office Account Security Operations Team monitoring compliance
with security requirements

e Post Office users handling enquiries regarding banking transactions
e Fujitsu Services System Support Centre for diagnostic information

Within Horizon (Online), audit data is collected from a number of subsystems. The following
categories of audit data are collected:

e Post Office Auditors in connection with Fraud investigations — in which case the data
may be presented as evidence in court

e Counter application messages received by the Branch Access Layer. This will include
counter transactions and events

« Data transferred across Horizon (Online) system boundaries. E.g. Bulk file transfers to
and from Post Office and their clients

e Solaris Host database systems audit and archive data. In this context database audit
data refers to the saving of logs of updates applied to the databases, and database
archive data refers to the saving of old data that has been purged from the primary
databases.

e NPS database audit data containing a record of banking transactions.
e Horizon (Online) system events — including security events

e Logging of activities undertaken by Fujitsu Services Post Office Account staff during
maintenance of the system

e System scheduler logs

15.3.2 Protection of Information System Audit Tools

As described in the Horizon (On-Line) Architecture - Support Services (Ref:-
ARC/SVS/ARC/0001) The Audit Data Gathering and Storage facilities must be generic and
extensible; in particular any new applications introduced into the Horizon (Online) system should
interface to the Audit Server.

Tools to extract and prepare data for analysis are provided together with facilities to manage
internal Post Office Account data retrieval activities. Access, by Post Office Account staff, to the
retrieval and extraction facilities is via the user interface provided on the Audit Workstation.

Access to the Audit servers and workstations is limited to authorised personnel and is policed
using two factor authentication and the Horizon (Online) Identity and Access Management
System.

The Audit Workstation provides facilities for authorised Fujitsu Services staff to access the Audit
Server in order to retrieve Audit Track data from the Audit Archive and to either select or prepare
Audit Track data for presentation to Post Office or in support of internal audit activities. The
Audit workstation is dedicated to this task & provides no other facilities.

Browse and filter tools are configured on the Audit Workstation enabling subsequent
searches/filters on files to be performed.

There is no automated synchronisation between the Audit Data Extraction and the Audit Data
filtering facilities
