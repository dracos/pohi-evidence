Thanks Alwen. Let me know where you get to by end of today.

I'd like a weekly update - just you and me is fine and we can extend if necessary leading up to
the interim review. 30 mins should do and happy to have over the phone when necessary.
Theresa pls could you set up?

Thx Paula

Lesley and I had a discussion yesterday and she is taking this forward with Fujitsu
today to ensure we get high level support for the review, and clear evidence

about any central system which can adjust sub postmaster accounts if it exists,
and its controls.

Susan and I have a call with SS at 930 when I will relay messages from James and
challenge as to why they have suggested there are failures at this stage.

I have contacted Janet to ask for a meeting but have had no reply. My concern is
that she is away, as I know she was planning a trip home to NZ and may not be
available until after recess so we loose 2 weeks!

I think the way forward is to try to get SS to work as agreed yesterday Paula. The
tisk is James’ letter ends up not saying what we heard but we cannot risk the delay

Dear all, just a quick note to say thank you for your help and briefing for the
above.

Alwen has a set of notes from the call, so you are very welcome to consult those
for a full debrief.

It went as well as we could have hoped. James agreed to most of what we asked
him to do. We will need to wait for him to consult Janet to be sure. But the call
will have moved things on and that is good.

The most important outcome to secure is the clarity around the two parts to the
ToR.

Alwen, did you catch up with Janet? As you said, it is critical that we keep up the
momentum from the call: narrowing back down SS to the ToR is urgent - ie.,
James’ letter. It might help if she realises that unless the letter goes soon, Janes
won't get his interim meeting in time.

Can you confirm by return what you see as next steps by who/when for the
different parts to this iinc., stakeholders, so we can be clear by end of today?

Thanks again,
