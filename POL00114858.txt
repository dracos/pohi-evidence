Checking a Discrepancy — (Part 6)

Please note: Discrepancies are not usually caused by system
problems they are more likely to be caused by user error - transactions
not entered correctly, stock incorrectly counted etc. Checks need to be
made before referring SPMR to HSH to investigate system fault.

Ask SPMR:

Where is the discrepancy showing? (Snapshot, View discrepancies
screen, trial balance)

If SPMR is not looking at a trial balance ask them to print one out after
declarations are made.

Once SPMR has trial balance ask:
What is the discrepancy now?
What was last week’s discrepancy?

Was last weeks discrepancy dealt with? (made good or put into
suspense)

Have daily reports been thoroughly checked?
Have weekly reports been checked?

Has cash been checked?

Does adjust stock match stock on hand?

Are all remittances in and out correct? (stock, cash, scratch cards,
cheques)

Has anything out of the ordinary been received? (u/p cheque, buy
back, error notice)

If SPMR has checked all above advise to roll over with the discrepancy
and make it good. The discrepancy may come back in the form of an
error notice at a later date.
