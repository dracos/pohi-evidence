Appendix A

1. Paula Vennells asked for a formal referrals policy to be agreed with Junction ensuring no active encouragement of personal injury referrals unless requested by the
customer. At present the following policy statement has been agreed between POFS and Junction:

“Post Office Insurance will always seek to provide our customers with the most relevant advice and support whilst making a claim and will not take any steps to
encourage or incentivise fraudulent Personal Injury Claims.

Further the Post Office Insurance will:

Not pass any Customer Data to Third Party organisation to proactively create Personal Injury Referrals.

Not ‘Claims Farm’ closed claims with the potential for personal injury claims.

Never provide any additional incentives to customers to pursue a personal injury claim.

Never call a customer after notification of a claim without their express consent with the objective of making a personal injury claim referral.
Never contact third parties with the intention of encouraging a personal injury claim referral.”

YRONS

2. Nick Kennett would also investigate the flow of fees to ensure that there is no inducement for wrong behaviours.

The following are the details of the staff incentive program for the claims team - although a component of the incentive relies on an appropriate introduction for a PI
referral this is part of a balanced score card approach. Inappropriate referrals would count against the agent's incentive.

“When conducting a First Notification of Loss call, the call centre operative is incentivised around the understanding of the customer's needs. A balanced scorecard
approach is used and if the contact centre operative does not meet the required standard, then they will not achieve their monthly bonus.

The key metrics that sit within the balanced score card are as follows:

Time taken to answer the call

Number of calls abandoned

Was the liability decision correct

Did the customer require a replacement vehicle and was a hire referral made

Was the customer injured and if they were, did they want representation and if so was an injury referral made

The call centre operative is also measured on their soft skills and this is done by call listening( both live and recorded). The reviewing manager will focus on the
following:

e Listening skills
e Empathy
e Building a rapport with the customer

Our [Junction] FNOL providers will monitor under and over performance and, if required, further training will be given to any advisors not meeting the required grade. In
addition to this, ACM also listens to a sample of calls each month and the quality scores are reported into board on a monthly basis.
