5.1 Summary.

The Release 1C service remained stable during March. Operational outlets are currently undergoing necessary refurbishment in
preparation for Release 2. The first Release 2 migrated outlet is now operational.

5.2 New Problem Reports
5.2.1 LIVE 1¢ System has NO Cash Account Week Dates

The HSH received calls late on 31/03/99 postmaster’s were unable to do Cash Account Week as the Date was not recognised. It
became apparent on Wednesday morning that the Ric system had received a Reference data update from POCL giving the Dates
for Cash Account Weeks for the year 1999/2000, week 1 was w/e 31/03/99.

It was found that the Files from POCL for the cash Account had NOT been sent, therefore there were NO dates in the SYSTEM to
allow PMs to do their Cash Account Week. The SSC were working on a manual fix, whilst the CS problem manager arranged with
POCL service management to get the reference data files across via email and, as a secondary measure, the files were also
couriered to the Reference Data team to input into the Reference RDMC Database for Rel 1c on Thursday(o1/04) morning. In the
meantime the SSC/OTT team had come up with a manual fix and inserted the dates for the next 2 weeks into the system. This was
then proved with a PM, who was trying to do an End of Week Cash Account, which was achieved successfully.

The HSH had received calls during the day from most of the PMs (about 150) regarding this problem. HSH were instructed to
advise the problem was in hand however, the PM’s could do the last 6 days as End Of Day accounts and add then together to
produce the End Of Week, or delay until the weekend and try End of Cash Week again. Advice was obtained from POCL before
issuing this guidance to the PMs.

This call will be left open until the Reference Data Files have been properly input into the 1c system. NO calls re this issue wer
made on1* April. This incident has now been closed.

5.3 Work In Progress Update

5.3.1 Incomplete Transaction Summary

March’s incident rate decreased to 0.03%, as the ratio of reconciliation incidents received by BSU was 33 against 102k
encashed payments. The incident category that composed the majority of March’s incidents was ‘Non-committed’
transactions. The ‘Incomplete transaction’ category now only accounts for 27% of the exceptions received by BSU in March.

The number of incidents in the ‘Non-committed’ category rose to 16 in March, indicating a small increase with the clerks
voiding the transaction after paying the customer, as compared to February when 15 were received. ‘Non-committed’
transactions account for 0.016% of the total encashment stream. In order to reinforce that a transaction can be successfully
completed without having to void, if the PM gets into difficulties, a Horizon procedures update has been issued.

Incidents due to ‘Incomplete transactions’ rose slightly to 9 in March, although a further reduction to 0.009% of the total
encashment stream occurred. This was due to the proportion of incidents in this category being fewer, as compared with
the total encashment stream. Two ‘Power failures’ occurred this month, one payment was successfully re-encashed on the
system, whereas the second is discussed in further detail later on in this report (Please refer to Section 5). Business Support
have discussed the importance of these incidents with HSH, in that if a PM contacts them regarding ‘Power failure’, then
immediate action must be taken by advising the PM to run an end of day report, to establish whether the transaction has
been committed.

There were 40 occurrences of transactions being forcibly committed in March, which is significantly higher than February
when there were 31. The total value of transactions saved by the forced committal fix over the March period is £1790.25,
which is slightly lower than the February figure of £1820.25. Between August 1998 and March 1999 the forced committal fix
has saved £13,606.40 worth of BES transactions.

Cards expiring at Post Offices before being collected

Existing beneficiaries are being nominated for new cards long before their current order books expire. In cases where benefit is
paid four-weekly, the trigger point used by CAPS is 8 weeks in advance of the last foil being used. The system is required to expire
uncollected cards after 56 days (8 weeks) and so in many cases the card expires as soon as it is received at the post office. As a
temporary measure, in order to reduce unnecessary cost and inconvenience to customers and post masters, the card expiry time
has been set to go days.

CAPS raised a CR (Coo73) to formalise the temporary measure and Pathway have responded with a CCN - CCN307a was
delivered on 30/7/98 but rejected by Horizon on 1/10/98. Pathway will be following up this rejection.

For NRz the expiry period reverts to 56 days - changes to BA and Pathway documentation provided to beneficiaries will emphasise
the need for prompt card collection, Awaiting further update.

Card Batch Reconciliation Procedure at Post Office

Card batch reconciliation is the process currently carried out by a post office clerk on receipt of a new card batch from De La Rue
Card Systems, prior to issuing a card to a customer. The purpose of this process is to check the integrity of the card batch.

Recent experience suggests that card reconciliation at the post office is onerous and time consuming for the post office clerk,

delays the issue of cards to the customer, and incurs an unnecessary cost for Pathway. Cards are being swiped through several
times. This causes a card and PUN re-order because the system then believes the card to be faulty or the card reader is faulty
(known as a Surplus to Batch Problem).

Action is required to reinforce the Batch Reconciliation Procedures at post offices.
CCN232, which seeks to modify this process at NR2+, was submitted to Horizon for approval and comments were received.
Following subsequent discussion with Horizon a new version of CCN232 (232¢) was issued in March 1999. Awaiting impacts.

5.4 Closed Since Last Report
5.4.1 Invalid Transaction Reference

On 22/01/99, a postmaster successfully swiped a card, however when the receipt printed, the transaction reference contained the
FAD, the node ID, and then, instead of the sequential reference number, 8 zeros. The clerk was able to finish the transaction and
everything, at this point, appeared in order. When the BES report was run, the said transaction did not feature. Investigation
shows that there is no record of any transaction in the Riposte message store.

12" February - the problem has been passed to BES / DEV on PinICL PCo020030.
Update 26" February - BES/Dev they are still investigating the problem, No reoccurrence this week. Await further update

Update from Richard Brunskil: No further update from Escher received to date. However, we have been assured by Development,
and have proved in our own testing, that the problem cannot occur with the NR2 kit as the ‘Log out’ screen cannot be accessed
from ‘Serve Customer’ where the card swipe has taken place. As the Customer is now content with our response to this problem
and we have had no other occurrences since the February, the problem should now be closed. Any findings received from Escher
in due course should be noted by Development and the recommendations applied as necessary. Incident closed.

5.4.2 Time-Out Fix not Working
A fix was delivered to PO counters on 09/02/98 to forcibly commit transactions after 74 minutes of inactivity. Another fix was
delivered on 17/05/98 to forcibly commit suspended sessions after 74 minutes of inactivity, However, there have been two

incidents of the ‘time out' fix not working correctly.

On 19'" February, a Tivoli script was written and a message sent to the counter to double check the version of software which is
being run at this counter. Update 26 February - no other occurrences.

This fix has now been proved to be working correctly. Incident closed.
