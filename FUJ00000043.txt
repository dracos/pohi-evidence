INTRODUCTION

to Schedule 6 of the Agreement or;

e Director Commercial and Finance — Fujitsu Services
« Contracts Manager (FS) — Post Office

Except where explicitly define herein, defined terms have the meaning given to them in
Schedule 1 of the Agreement.

The list of Key Personnel set-out in section 2 to this document has been agreed to
provide continuity of business, and delivery of the changes listed in Schedule 12 of the
Agreement and other changes introduced on Amendment Date.

It is the intension of both parties that the list of Key Personnel will change over the term
of the contract to reflect the priorities at that time and that this document will be updated
under the Soft Change Control Procedure to reflect such changes. This document is a
CCD and is allocated to the Commercial Forum for that purpose but may not be
disclosed to members of that Forum except in accordance with Schedule 6.

If, despite Fujitsu Services’ reasonable endeavours, a Person, becomes unable to
perform the Role as set out in the list then Fujitsu Services shall fill that role with a
person with appropriate capabilities and knowledge and shall use all reasonable

endeavours to ensure a seamless handover from the Person to their replacement.
