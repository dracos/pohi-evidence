Tom
For the immediate problem I can confirm the engineer is on site. I’ll discuss longer term issues on kiosk 69 with NCR.

I would also suggest that a new shared stock unit is set up just for kiosk 69 and that it’s reallocated in horizon to the new
stock unit. Any problems on balancing and rolling over are then isolated to kiosk 69.

Regards

Phil

Phil — potential for a loss here subject to access to the notes vault. I am sure that Sue has many ref numbers on this so
can you escalate and see if engineer attendance timescales can be improved upon please with a view for permanent
resolution even if it means a swap out.

Gents,

Regarding SSk 69 ( the most troublesome one of 3) I have had to show a loss of £509. This machine has not worked
properly since installation — engineers are constantly on call out, the main problem being it keep switching to US dollars!
New software and hardware have been fitted and it is constantly on card payment only. As you know if anything is
wrong with any one of the 3 machines you cannot balance the stock unit so as I reported this fault yet again yesterday at
6pm and was told 24hours ( which is working hours) which means an engineer will not be here till COB Thursday I took
the decision to empty the machine. I could remove all coin and some notes but it will not let me transfer all notes and I
cannot get to them — hence the shortage. Obviously when an engineer does turn up I will ask them to get to the notes
but my worry is they won’t be there.

I will not accept a loss for this and the level of service from NCR , both timings and effectiveness is well below what I
expected. SSK 69 needs to be removed and a complete new model installed asap. Until such time I will only operate this
machine on a card payment basis as that way it cannot swallow any more cash.
