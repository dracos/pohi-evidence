Subject: RE: Fact File for review

Attachments: PART ONE - SS (AP comments).pdf

All
Please find attached my comments on the Part 1 report.

In general, the report broadly replicates the original factfile with a few additions and deletions. On the whole, these
changes are not, in my view, controversial.

However, SS have injected in a number of places their opinions on certain matters (highlighted in yellow in the
attached). Putting aside whether those opinions are correct or not, they should not be included in the Part 1 report:

«The Part 1 report was supposed to be a neutral factual statement — these opinions would be better presented in
the Thematic report.

e All the opinions are unsupported by either logical reasoning or evidence. Even if these opinions were set out in
the Thematic Report, SS need to properly justify these views otherwise they should not be permitted to advance
them in any form.

Of some concern is SS' approach as set out in para 1.1. They say that the Part 1 Report is designed to support their
thematic report. I understood the purpose of the report to be to assist the mediator and the parties at mediation. To my
mind, this highlights the difference in approach between POL and SS and closing this gap is important for moving cases
forward to mediation.

My only other thought is that SS' changes from the original factfile are fairly minimal and this cannot have taken more than
one day's work.

Kind regards
Andy

Subject: Fact File for review

Belinda Crowe; Rodric Williams; Parsons, Andrew; Andy Holt;

All,

Attached is the Second Sight Fact file. From a quick initial review it appears to be a mix of facts which read similarly to
the Post Office document together with a some new content Eg:

“4,22. Despite this description of an apparently extensive support mechanism, feedback during the Complaint Review
process has indicated a lack of consistent, constructive advice being provided, especially from the Horizon Service Desk
and from the NBSC.”

We are due to meet to review this and any further reports (lan has indicated tha tomorrow.
