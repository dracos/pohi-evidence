2 Training and Support

2.1. I Received initial training from Defendant Not applicable
re: Horizon when introduced in
1999/2000 (Yes/No)

2.2. I Received initial training from Defendant I Yes

In March 2005 I attended a training course at
one of the Post Office’s call centres in
Hampstead. The training lasted for 10 days
and focused on how to carry out
transactions. During the training we had our
own terminal and the training mainly focssed
on manually chansing dates on samps, up
selling from recorded delivery to special
delivery, DVLA services and _ general
accounting for daily transactions. There was
no training in relaiton to balancing, apart from
they told me this has to be done and what to
do with discrepncies. There was no mention
of being able to settle centrally .

I had two Post Office trainers visit me for the
first two weeks. Mainly the trainers watched
over my shoulder as I processed items. I was
shown how to account for remittances in and
out. Junaid was the trainer for the first week
and Michael the second week but I do not
recall their surnames. I was not shown how
to use the suspense account nor was I

Ref: JG/2114176/1 2

POL00066262
POL00066262

shown what to do when errors occurred or
when data had been incorrectly inputted into
Horizon.

During the first week of on-site training with
Junaid we carried out a cash declaration and
encountered a shortfall of £70 which I think
was on the very first day of trading. I was
very surprised to see this as Junaid had
been watching every entry that I had made
on Horizon. When I queried this with him,
Junaid said ‘it’s never penny-to-penny from
day-to-day, it will come out alright on
Wednesday”. He suggested that the
discrepancy would work itself out as there
were always fluctuations, either surpluses or
shortfalls, that would balance each other out
but in the meantime I would have to make it
good. I remember going to the shop till and
taking out £70 to pay into the post office. I
never called the helpline about this since I
thought as per Junaid’s comments that it
would sort itself out later. On the Wednesday
balancing exercise I expected to see a
surplus given what Junaid had said but there
was none. He had said that these could take
some time to come through, up to 6 months
for National Savings corrections and error
notices. Junaid advised me that shortfalls
that appeared when balancing could be paid
with cash but never tried to explain why
these shortfalls may occur or how to try and
rectify them. I was shocked that Junaid had
not been able to rectify this shortfall on the
day seeing as he was a Post Office trainer
and not only that but he failed to investigate it
further.

On the second week of on-site training I was
trained by Michael.

For the duration of the week he watched over
all of my transactions presumably with a view
to train and correct any mistakes I might
have made. On the Wednesday of that week,
there was a shortfall of approximately £200
and neither I nor Michael had any idea how
this had arisen. He told me that he did not
know the root cause of the shortfall and he
called the helpline.

He spoke to the helpline member and
followed the step-by-step instructions the
member gave him. He imputed some
information into Horizon and then took a

Ref: JG/2114176/1 3
POL00066262
POL00066262

balance which showed that the shortfall had
doubled to £400. We were both shocked. I
also told him about the shortfall the week
prior with Junaid and was very surprised to
hear about it. He could not explain how the
figure had doubled after he had followed the
exact instructions given to him by the helpline
and had no idea how the original shortfall
had arisen.

Michael repeated to me the advice that he
had been given by the helpline which was
“make the till good now and you might get an
error notice”. Michael then left for the day
and told me to call the helpline if I got an
error notice. He seemed somewhat hesitant
to leave me on this note because he knew
that following the helplines instructions had
led to the shortfall doubling and I was now
being told that I had to make good the
shortfall out of my own pocket. Michael
seemed quite concerned as he knew that it
was wrong that I had to pay this through no
fault of my own.

2.3.

Received any further training from
Defendant re: Horizon? (Yes/No, and if
yes give date and brief details of any
training said to have been inadequate or
inappropriate)

No

2.4.

Contacted Helpline to seek advice re:
Horizon and/or alleged shortfalls?
(Yes/No, and if yes give approximate
date and brief details of any advice and
responses said to have been inadequate
or inappropriate)

Pending access to any helpline call logs that
Post Office may hold, my recollections are as
follows:

Yes
Frequency of contact: 2-3 times per week
Details:

If I could not resolve the issue, which was
nearly all the time, I would contact the
helpline who would advise me to use the
settle centrally function at the end of the
trading period. I followed these instructions
and did use the settle centrally function on
numerous occasions.

In fact I contacted the helpline regularly to
ask for help on discrepancies, transaction
corrections, cash declarations, balancing
issues and faults with Horizon. . On a

Ref: JG/2114176/1 4

POL00066262
POL00066262

Wednesday in particular it was so difficult to
get through to the helpline and I would be
kept on hold for hours. I assumed that this
was because so many other SPM's or post
office staff would be calling for help on
Wednesday's because this was the
mandatory balancing day. I often stayed
behind until past midnight long after the
branch and shop had closed to try and
ascertain the cause of discrepancies that I
had.

Often when I called the helpline about a
discrepancy they would just tell me rollover
the shortfall or don’t trade. I would also call
the helpline to ask for training on
transactional errors but no proper training
was offered to me on how to resolve a
balancing error

POL00066262

On 14 October 2005, Alan Stuart, Post Office
auditor, attended my branch unannounced
with two other auditors. After they had carried
out the audit they told me that there was a
shortfall of £3,541.24. I asked them how this
had been calculated and the auditors told me
that I would have to speak to Post Office
directly and contact my local Area Manager. I
remember that they told me that they could
offer no help whatsoever and that I would
have to make good the loss.

The auditors also gave me a warning that if I
were to incur any further shortfalls of £500 or
more then Post Office would take the branch
away from me. I was shocked and upset to
hear this as I had no explanation of how the
shortfalls were arising and felt that I had no
control over the discrepancies as I was never
told how they had arise or why. They made
me feel so inadequate. They told me to
speak to Elaine Ridge. I did so and she said
that she would come and see me. When she
did she said “/ don’t why you are having
these problems, you are the only one, we
have so many crown offices but it is just your
post office’. This made me feel even more
inadequate as I believed her.

1 January 2009

At around 8:30am on 14 January 2008 three
Post Office auditors being Keith Noverre,
Sue Le May and Chris Stevens, attended my
branch unannounced. Keith Noverre had
been with Alan Stuart as a trainee at the first
audit. I was not present for the audit and my
husband told the auditors that I was visiting
relatives in Luton that day.

The auditors made my husband stay for the
audit but also insisted that I must attend as I
was SPM. The auditors were aggressive to
my husband, they even asked why he was
there and he said that he ran the shop. I
arrived to the branch at around 10.45am.

The auditors were at the branch all day and
closed the post office for the entire day. In
the suspense account there was an amount
held in cash in pouches of £27,000 and an
amount held in currency pouches with rem
slips dated 9 January 2008 enclosed but

Ref: JG/2114176/1 6
POL00066262
POL00066262

there was no cash. I explained that I was
hoping to get the cash from family that day to
be able to send the £27,000 back to the cash
centre.

Having now seen the audit report, I was not
provided with a copy at the time, it states that
the purpose of the audit was to verify
financial assets due to Post Office and
confirm compliance with a range of Business
processes, procedures and _ regulatory
requirements.

The auditors told me to rollover as I would
normally do as the office was in the previous
trading period. The auditors told me that
there was a shortfall of £80,000.

Whilst I was being interviewed, the interim
Subpostmaster who had been appointed
undertook his own audit and he uncovered a
surplus of £2,000.

The audit report that I have now seen, having
not been previously provided with a copy,
states that the shortfall was £77,643.87
which was made up as follows:

£37,882.27 (-) identified as
difference in cash figures

£3,173.60 (-) identified as a
difference in stock figures
£2,891.25 (-) identified as
difference in cheque figures
£264.45 (+) identified as a
difference in foreign currency figures
£27,000 (-) cash in pouches
£3,930.07 (-) currency in
pouches

£3,034.03 (-) outstanding
debt

At around 2pm, investigators Adrian Morris,
John Longman and Lisa Allen arrived at the
branch and they interviewed me and
recorded the interview. They asked me if I
wanted to be accompanied at the interview
but as I knew I had not taken the money
myself I said no. We went upstairs to the
empty space above the shop for the
interview. We never did make that space into
a flat because we didn’t get planning
permission.

Ref: JG/2114176/1 7
POL00066262
POL00066262

They asked me if I had stolen £89,000 from
the post office. I said no. They asked me if I
had ever stolen any money from the post
office and I responded that I had not taken a
single penny. I said that everything that I had
done, I had done to save my business.

They asked if they could search my home
and I said that they could. They went through
all of my drawers and cupboards but never
told me what they were looking for. We were
living in rented accommodation across the
toad from the shop at that time so we had
gone across for the search together. Our
home was so minimal as we had no money
to decorate, we even had our mattresses on
the floor, no actual beds.

and brief details of any investigation(s) in With regards me being told by the trainer in
relation to which the Claimant raises a the first 2 weeks of training that a voucher
. would be issued for the discrepancy, Second
complaint) Sight state “We consider that the fact that the
trainer told the Applicant that a ‘voucher’
would be issued, suggests that he
considered at the time that grounds may
have existed for Post Office to agree to write
off that loss, even though the circumstances
of the loss do not appear to have been
recorded at the time” (para 4.5);

In relation to my request for training, Second
Sight state “Between the end of her training,
and an Audit taking place on 14 October
2005, branch staff telephoned the NBSC
helpline to request assistance with balancing
on 31 occasions, so it would appear that the
Applicant was struggling with her new role
and the staff were unable to help her’. (para
46),

In relation to my complaints about the
helpline, Second Sight state “Also, there
seems to have been little or nothing by way
of emailed instructions or other
communications, spelling out the steps that
needed to be taken, following those calls, to
avoid the recurrence of mistakes and to

Ref: JG/2114176/1 8
POL00066262
POL00066262

ensure that the branch’s books were properly
corrected” (para 4.8);

In relation to training, Second Sight state “We
believe that it is incumbent upon Post Office
to ensure that Subpostmasters are entirely
suitable and fully trained for the role, given
the considerable financial responsibilities that
the Subpostmasters contract places upon
them and the considerable investment that
most of them, like this Applicant, have made”
(para 4.11);

With regards the shortfall of £3,184.53 that
was discovered at the first audit, Second
Sight state “From the documents that have
been provided to us, we can find nothing to
suggest that any steps were taken to identify
the cause of the shortfall that had been
identified by this Audit, nor were the Audit
findings discussed with the Applicant in order
to avoid a repetition of the mistakes that had
given rise to the disclosed shortfall’ (para
4.21);

In respect of me reporting staff thefts to POL,
Second Sight state “we find ourselves unable
to agree entirely with the conclusion that the
Applicant failed to notify Post Office of her
suspicions that staff were stealing from the
branch, as Post Office’s own records
document her concerns in calls to the
Helpline on a number of occasions, starting
from the very beginning of her tenure. Indeed
the October 2005 audit was instigated by
Post Office for that very reason.” (para 4.24)

and brief details)
We eventually sold the shop and post office
on 3 March 2010 for around £65,000 when
actually it was worth at least £300,000 by
then but the value had depreciated so much
by what had happened and we were
desperate to sell. We actually still owe
Natwest £1,000 on the mortgage as the
proceeds did not redeem the mortgage in full.

6. Civil and Criminal Proceedings

6.1. I Did the Defendant pursue recovery of Yes/No: Yes
any alleged shortfalls by civil
proceedings? (Yes/No, and if yes give
date and brief details)

Details:

Post Office was also chasing payment of the
shortfall but they were corresponding directly
with our solicitors.

Shortly after I was released Post Office
obtained a confiscation order in relation to
our flat in London. This was the 3 double
bedroom flat that we had purchased in 2000
which had a balcony, 2 bathrooms. It was
sold for about £100,000 and we still owe the
mortgage provider £1,000. Post Office would
have received no money from that sale so I
do not know why they bothered to take it
from us and sell it. The property was sold at
auction and it would have sold for more if left
to the open market.

The terms of the confiscation are that if we
receive any significant money such as a
windfall for 6 years from the date of the order
this too will be confiscated.

6.2. I If yes, what was outcome of Outcome: Confiscation Order in favour of
proceedings? (Settled, Judgment for the Post Office
Claimant, Judgment for Defendant,

currently stayed) Details: See above.

Please give date and brief details.

6.3. I Did the Defendant pursue any criminal Yes/No: Yes

proceedings against the Claimant? . .
Post Office commenced criminal proceedings

Ref: JG/2114176/1 11
POL00066262
POL00066262

(Yes/No) against me for 1 count of theft and 6 counts
of false accounting. I instructed a local
criminal solicitor that I had found through the
local Citizens Advice Bureau called David
Castle at Castle & Co Solicitors.

The initial case was heard at Woking
Magistrates Court on 19 December 2008 at
which I pleaded guilty to the 6 counts of false
accounting and not guilty to the single charge
of theft of £74,609.84.

The trial was listed for 29 May 2009.
However, on 28 May 2009

The proceedings were adjourned to June
2009 but we had made disclosure requests
of the Post Office that they had not complied
with and the trial ended up getting adjourned
again and again until 11 October 2010 when
it finally commenced.

We went into court I was handed down a
unanimous guilty verdict.

I was so shocked. In fact there was total
shock around the entire court room. We just
couldn't believe that the jury could have
found me guilty when there was no evidence
that I had stolen the money. We were
absolutely devastated.

On 11 November 2010, my eldest son’s 10"
birthday, I attended Guildford Crown Court
for sentencing. The Judge sentenced me to
15 months imprisonment. I was told that I
would have to serve 7 % months.

I had had pains in my stomach all that day
but they got worse, I began crying
uncontrollably and I had a short black out.
The ushers walked me out to the side
corridor but I couldn’t even walk because of
the sharp pains in my stomach so they were
holding me up. They took me to the cells
where I met with Issy and Keith my barrister
who told me that I could be out in 3 %
months. They gave me water but I was in so
much pain in my stomach that they called an
ambulance.

Ref: JG/2114176/1 12
POL00066262
POL00066262

I was taken by ambulance to the Royal
Surrey hospital. I was put into a bed and the

Officers supervising me and I had to be
handcuffed to even go to the toilet. I spent
one night in hospital and the next day the
pains had calmed down a bit and I could walk
again.

The Post Office told me that they were taking
me to Bronzefield Prison and that they had to
handcuff me to take me. I begged them not
to, I said that I was pregnant and pleaded
with them not to put the handcuffs back on.
They said they had to. I asked them to put
my jacket over my hands so that no-one
could see the handcuffs when I left the
hospital as I was so embarrassed and
ashamed.

My application to be released with a tag was
approved and after just under 4 months in
prison I was released on 7 March 2011 when
I was 6 months pregnant.

6.4. I If yes, specify (with dates): (a) 1 count of theft and 6 counts of false

accounting.

(a) charges (Theft, False Accounting,
and any other charges); (b) guilty on all counts

(b) outcome (guilty after contested
trial, acquitted after contested
