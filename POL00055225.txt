Hi John

The last update | had on the above was in July, the Defence Solicitors had requested they had access to the
operations in Chesterfield. This was discussed by Andy Winn/ Rod Ismay. | have today spoken with Andy
Winn and he has informed me that Rod had made a decision to not allow this. Therefore could you please
update me with the latest progress on the case.

Kind regards
