Abbreviation Definition
‘Authorised Client This signifies projected settlement awaiting the Confirmed Client
Transaction Awaiting ‘Transaction. From a system perspective, an ‘S’ transaction — Not
Confirmation applicable to Network Banking Reports.

Bank Transaction Id I Message sequence number assigned by the message originator
(except Horizon), to assist in identifying a transaction uniquely.
Stays unchanged through the life of the transaction.

C4 Processing Date The System Processing Date on which the ‘C4’ was received by
the DRS. Where a C4 is included on report NB1O1, the C4
Processing Date is the same as the Run Date for report NB1O1.

C4 Settlement Date The Settlement Date provided on the C4 transaction.
Confirmed Client From a ‘Client’ perspective, a transaction that has been authorised
Transaction to either debit or credit an account. From a system perspective, a

‘C4’ transaction.

Counter Confirmations I From an outlet / POL perspective, a successfully completed
transaction at the counter. From a system perspective, a ‘C12’

transaction.
Exceptioned Client From a Client perspective, a transaction reconciliation difference
Transaction highlighted within the NBE and notified to Horizon. From a
system perspective, a ‘D” transaction.
Exception Types Within all reports the ‘Exceptions’ category will include:

© ‘Incomplete States’, i.e. those transactions where one or more
transaction component is missing — a C4 without a C12 ete

© Genuine exceptions where transaction components belonging
to the same high level transaction have been exceptioned, i.e.
C12 (amount) not = to C4 (amount) ete.

* NBE/ DRS corruption’s

Horizon_Txn_Num Unique transaction number to be used in all messages between
Horizon and the NBE relating to the transaction. Generated by
Horizon and provided in the request message initiating the
transaction.

‘New’ Transactions ‘Transactions that have had a change of state since they were last
reported, or have never been reported except in NB102 section 6.
Note that if transaction appears in NB102 section 6 it is future
dated as is reported in that section for information only. Once
future dated transactions become current dated, they must be
reported as though they have not appeared on the reports before.

“Old” Transactions Transactions that have NOT had a change of state since they were
last reported.

Receipt Date Receipt Date is the Date as printed on the transaction Receipt at
the Counter. It forms part of all transactions.

Settlement date from the transaction elements (C112, C12, C4, S
& D) that make up a Network Banking transaction. If'no Bank
Settlement date is available, the Reconciliation Date will be set to
the processing date that the Data Reconciliation Service first
recorded any element of the transaction being received. If a
Settlement date subsequently becomes available, the first
available Bank Settlement date will replace the processing date.
However, once a transaction has been accounted for on the
reconciliation reports, the Reconciliation Date will never change

Routing_Gateway Identifies a system, where the authorisation for a specific
transaction should be sought. For Network Banking, this refers to
the Routing_Gateway as defined in Network Banking Engine
NBE - Horizon Application Interface Specification (NB/IFS/008)

Run Date This is the System Processing Date for which the report refers, ic.

all transaction components processed by the DRS on System
Processing Date dd/mm/yyyy are accounted for on this report.

Settlement Date

Settlement Date is often the same as Run Date but some Financial
Institutions may assign a Settlement Date in the future: e.g. the
following Monday may be set on transactions processed on the
preceding Friday. Saturday and Sunday.

TIP Transactions

From an outlet / POL perspective, a transaction that has been sent
from TPS to POL TIP. From a system perspective, a *C112”

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

Introduction

This document has been compiled to specify all Fujitsu Services Pathway outputs
from the Data Reconciliation Service (DRS) to enable a generic end to end
reconciliation of Network Banking transaction processing.

Scope

This document defines the format and content of all reconciliation reports, which
satisfy the Network Banking reconciliation requirement. It does not attempt to define
within the operating systems, including the Network Banking Engine, (NBE) how the
transactions are processed.

The following Network Banking requirements are satisfied by this document:

© Reconciliation: [NBR0040], [NBR0042], [NBRO183], [NBR0212], [NBR0227],
[NBR0229], [NBR0278], [NBR0294], [NBR0389}

© Settlement: [NBR0230}, [NBR0456]

¢ Error Resolution: [NBR0260]

It is assumed that each of the POL clients, as dictated by Routing_Gateway (assumed
to be at this point the Banks / LINK) will require a separate reconciliation report set.

Within this report set, separate reports will be provided as per the following table:

Report Number Deposit Transactions [ \drawal Transactions
NBIOL ‘Combined Report
NBIOZ ‘Combined Report
NB1O3 Y I ¥

NB000 is a combined report for all Routing Gatewa'

The format and content of each client’s report is considered to be identical when
allowing for these specific requirements. It should therefore be understood that the
specifications documented here are applicable to each client report set. (Specific client
requirements outside of this reporting specification are not covered within this
document)

‘There must be a separate set of reports to provide for transactions for which the
Routing Gateway and/or Transaction Type is not known.

Balance Enquiries and PIN changes are explicitly excluded from the report set as “Not
Required by POL”

No report will mix currency, so if ever the transactions selected to appear on a set of
reports are not of a single currency, then a separate set of reports will be produced for
each currency. All the amounts in a single transaction will always use the same
currency

Rows and columns ate described in detail, together with the mathematical calculations
required to achieve reconciliation.

All general aspects relating to the production and transmission of the reports are
described.

This document does not attempt to define the business processes undertaken within
Fujitsu Services Pathway and POL with respect to the resolution of any exceptions,
which may arise, nor does it scope the requirement for any systems that may be
required to assist in this process. This information can be found in the associated
documents, reference:

NB: It should be noted that where a system ‘State’ definition is quoted, this takes
precedence over any narrative which has only been provided to help understand the
business processes.

3.0 General Report Specifications
A separate set of reports is produced for each POL client as identified by the
Routing_Gateway. (LINK being a single client). The specification is general to all
reports sets.
1. For volumes and values the accounting sense for reporting purposes to allow
settlement totals to be correctly derived, will be:
«Absolute volume
© Net value
© Where no value reported show “{Cusreney}-0.00”
© Where no volume reported show 0
¢_-ve values will be shown in brackets e.g. (nnn.nn) + (Formatted: Bullets and Numbering }

iy

Each report will show the following general information:

Report title — including the client name (derived from Routing_Gateway.)
Transaction Type — (if applicable)

Report ‘Run Date’ - ie., the period for which the report refers
Production date and time

Fujitsu Services Pathway report number

Fujitsu Services Pathway reference-and-contact point

3. Where ‘Received’ and ‘Reconciliation Date’ are quoted against time parameters:

« ‘Received = New’: defines transactions that have had a change of state since
they were last reported, or have never been reported, except in NB102 section
6

© ‘Received = Old’: defines transactions that have NOT had a change of state
since they were last reported

4. Reports: NB000, NB101, NB102 will be produced DAILY, NB103 will be
produced WEEKLY atter Friday’s and prior to Saturdays TPS processing
schedule. They will be delivered by 08.00hrs the day following the Run Date to:
© POL/ TIP gateway: The Host writes the reports to a directory. These are

picked up by FTMS and posted to the TIP gateway. (As per other Host to
external systems applications)

5. Within report NB 102 the ‘Exceptions’ category will include:
© ‘Incomplete States’, i.e. those transactions where one or more transaction
component is missing — a C4 without a C12 ete
* Genuine exceptions where transaction components belonging to the same high
level transaction have been exceptioned, i.e. C12 (amount) not = to C4
(amount) etc.
¢ NBE/ DRS corruption’s

6. For clarity within this document, field sizes are shown within ‘Report Layout’ and
not within the ‘Data Definition’

7. All reports are run against a consistent data set.

8. All reports will be produced as ASCII text files ~ one for each report. The report
layout will be fixed format with space characters providing the blank space. This
will allow for ‘Excel’ input, using fixed field width facilities. The formatting
(lines & shading referred to in this document) will not be included within the file.
Every line will have the character ‘newline’, Hex ‘0A’, as the last character. Each
report will have the text “End of Report” as the last line.

3.2.43.3.1 _NB102: Rules (Formatted: Bullets and Numbering )

NB102 is run daily

'NB102 is repeated for each Routing_Gateway.

For each report section, the column ‘Values’ will be partitioned into 8 sub

columns to contain the values for: ‘C12’, ‘S’, ‘C4’, C112’ & the four values from

a‘D’ which are: Amount Requested, Amount Authorised, Amount Confirmed,

Amount Discrepancy. The reports will populate all values that are available.

4. For reporting purposes, within NB102 sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 & II, the
column headed *CAP” will report the Cash Account period obtained from the
*C112° transaction element, Where no *C112° transaction element has been.
received, the “CAP” will be blank.

5. For reporting purposes within NB102 sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 8,9, 10, 11, the column
headed ‘Discrepancy Type’ will report the ‘D’ discrepancy type and be populated
with the following codes:

(NB: For a list of Discrepancy Reason Codes for Network Banking, refer to
NB/IFS/008: NBE - Horizon Application Interface Specification)

Where no “D” transaction element has been received, the ‘Discrepancy Type’ will
be blank

6. Where an exception is set to F99 by Fujitsu Services Pathway, clearance of this
exception within the appropriate NB102 section, (e.g. section 2 exceptions shown
as cleared within section 8), will always refer to the previously reported state
regardless of any change of state which may have occurred within the DRS.

7. All Uncleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & TIP exceptions are reported as

summary totals by exception type - (NB102 section 1)

individually — (NB102 section 11)

Cleared Future Dated Transactions are reported as summary totals by Client

identified by Routing_Gateway — (NB102 Section 12)

19. Within each section, exception summary totals / individual transactions are to be
grouped and sub totalled by reconciliation date with a total provided for the entire
section.

20. For reporting purposes:

© Timing Differences: relate to differences in the reconciliation date / settlement
date allocated where a settlement date on a transaction element is not the same
as the reconciliation date first reported on that transaction.

© Future Dated Transactions: relate to those transactions that have a
Reconciliation Date ahead of the Run Date of the report. For example, most
Clients will settle Friday, Saturday and Sunday transactions on the following
Monday. This means that each transaction completed on these days will have a
Reconciliation Date ahead of the Run Date of the report. These transactions
are expected to clear naturally once the Reconciliation Date and the Run Date
are in sync, however in the rare eventuality that a Reconciliation Date is
considerably ahead of the Run Date, POL may wish to clear the exception
manually. In this case, Fujitsu Services Pathway will set the transaction to
“£99.

For reporting purposes, within NB102 sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10,11, the column

headed “Transaction Type’ will be populated by the following codes:
© 03 — Withdrawal (With PIN)

04 — Withdrawal with balance (With PIN)

05 — Withdraw all (With PIN)

13 = Withdrawal (With signature)

14 — Withdrawal with balance (With signature)

15 = Withdraw all (With signature)

2 Deposit (No verification)

. For Network Banking reconciliation reporting, System States 8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17,

18, 19, 20, 3, F05, B06, £07, E14, E2: E31, E32, £33, E38 are never
expected within report NB102 because ‘S’ transactions are not used in NB.

3.33.4 NB103: Settled transaction / Cash Account (Formatted: Bullets and Numbering )

Reconciliation Statement

This report allows POL to reconcile the settlement stream against the Outlet Cash
Account stream. This reconciliation is required as settlement with the individual POL
clients is based upon the C4 Processing Date’. To complete a full reconciliation, it is
important to know which Cash Account the settled transaction was posted to, to
enable a reconciliation of settlement to be made with the outlet records. This report
reconciles the transactions by *C4 Processing Date’ and Cash Account record.

3.3.13.4.1__NB103: Rules + (Formatted: Bullets and Numbering )

1. NB103 is run weekly: In order to align with internal POL / TIP processing it is
required that this report is produced AFTER TPS and NB101 processing on
Friday and BEFORE PS processing on Saturday. The report should include all
“C4 transaction values where:

¢ °C4 Processing Date’ = run date and,

« ’C4 Processing Date’ = run date minus‘N’ (where ‘N’ = I to 13),

Where a C112 is available and the CAP is known, the ‘C4’ transaction value will
be posted against the appropriate CBDB CAP column.

3. Where a C112 is available and the CAP is known, but there is no C4, it will not
be reflected in the report because this report includes C4 transaction values only.

4. Where no C112 is available and therefore the CAP is unknown:

e the ‘C4* transaction value should be posted to ‘No Cash Account Allocated”

e then, when the C112 becomes available, the entry should be deleted from
Cash Account Allocated’ and posted to the appropriate CBDB CAP column

«  ifno C112 has been received after 14 days, the entry within ‘No Cash
Account Allocated’ should remain until the C112 becomes available even
if exceeds 14 days
5. If a transaction is posted to the row ‘No C/A to TIP’ (according to rule 2 and 3
above:
¢ the transaction should remain in this row until the Cash Account has been
delivered to TIP and then move up into the row ‘C/A to TIP”

¢  ifno Cash Account has been delivered to TIP after 14 days, the entry in
‘No C/A to TIP’ should remain until the Cash Account is delivered to TIP
even if this exceeds 14 day:

6. As the report is run each week, the transactions should move across the report
according to the CAP and the reconciliation date; for example, a transaction
posted to CBDB>=plus 2 in the first week, will move to CBDB plus I the second
week and then appear in CBDB the third week, until disappearing off the report
after 14 days

7. Where the columns headed ‘CAPXX’ are referred to, the actual report produced
with show the actual CAP number, for example CBDB CAP 40 is quoted, the
column ‘CAPXX: will show ‘CAP40<=-2"

8. NBI103 reports on VALUE only

9. A separate report NB103 will be produced for both Deposit and Withdrawal
transactions derived from “Txn_type’

10. Five CAP’s will be shown, the “CBDB’, the ‘CBDB’ minus 1, the ‘CBDB? <=
minus 2, the ‘CBDB’ plus I and the “CBDB’ >=plus 2. In addition, those settled
transactions which currently have not been allocated a Cash Account will be
shown,

. The ‘CBDB’ Cash Account period (CAP) equates to TWO CAP’s prior to the
CAP applicable to the run date of the report. For example: If the report was run on
Saturday 20" January within CAP42 (CAP 42 commenced on Thursday 17%
January), the *CBDB’ CAP would be CAP40 (CAP40 commenced Thursday 3"
January, ended Wednesday 9* January)

12. Where the CAP in which the Outlet is trading is numerically more than 2 weeks
prior to the “CBDB’ CAP, if this takes the Outlet CAP into the previous year, this
will be reported as such. For example: The *CBDB’ CAP is CAP 1 and the Outlet
is trading in CAP 51, this is assumed to be CAP 51 of the previous year,
(therefore ‘CBDB’ <=minus 2) and not reported ahead in the current year.

13. The C4 processing dates will be shown in reverse chronological order.

14. For a given C4 Processing Date, the sum of the two Total values (for the two rows
C/A to TIP and No C/A to TIP) should be equal to the Total corresponding
Receipts or Payments value on report NB10I for the same Run Date.
