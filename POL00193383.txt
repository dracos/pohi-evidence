Have we discussed these drafts within legal yet?

STRICTLY PRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO LEGAL PRIVILEGE - DO NOT FORWARD.
Lesley,

Please find attached two drafts of a letter to put us “on the record” with Fujitsu about the issues raised in Second
Sight’s Interim Report, and the impact of them on the Court proceedings we bring.

The drafts differ in tone:
- the “shot across the bow” aims to put pressure on FJ to work with us to improve Horizon and user confidence
in it;
- the “letter of claim” goes further, tying the issues to our contract with FJ and escalating them through its
dispute resolution procedure.

In either case, we need to set out what we want FJ to do. That should set the tone for the letter - the more aggressive
we are, the more defensive (and therefore less supportive) FJ are likely to be.

Could you please let me know when you might be able to discuss the approach we want to take?

Kind regards, Rodric
