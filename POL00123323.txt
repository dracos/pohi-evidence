Dear All

I refer to our meeting of Friday the 25"" July 2014 to discuss the draft prosecution policy. POL had advice from senior
Counsel and BAQC . I would advise POL should not be quick to disregard that advise. If there are any concerns arising
out of that documents that have been prepared, it may be appropriate to refer them to BAQC for further
consideration and clarification.

Regards

Jarnail
