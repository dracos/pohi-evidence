Attending Richard Morgan in relation to the draft witness statements of Ann Chambers and
Gareth Jenkins.

He wants Ann Chambers witness statement to be completely redrafted into more the
narrative format. He also asked whether the call logs are recorded. We need to put right at
the beginning when first Ann Chambers got involved and explain her involvement in more of
a narrative format and explain what her more recent involvement is.

In relation to Gareth Jenkins' statement, we need to firstly say that he holds a position with
a job title of distinguished engineer. It might be that we decide to put all the information he
is saying into the expert's report given that it is really opinion evidence.

The next steps are:

1.   I will rework Ann's statement.
2.   I will not chase Gareth on his.
3.   I will instruct the expert but I will not send them a draft statement.
4.   Richard will go over all the pleadings and the reply in making a list of issues that we
     need to colour off in evidence.
5.   I will get a complete set of the papers copied and sent to Counsel.
