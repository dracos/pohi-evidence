1 Introduction

This document has been produced following the POCL / ICL Pathway
Acceptance Board Meeting of 18/08/99 and addresses the comments made in
the minutes of that meeting with respect to Acceptance Incident 408 and the
statements made in the POCL paper AI408 - HSH Service Level Failure -—
24/08/99.

This document provides additional information and explanation to that
contained in HSH Scripting, SLA Recovery and Resource Plan - CS/SMM/AI408 -
17/08/99 issued to POCL as input to the Acceptance Board.

This document has been updated in the light of the Acceptance Workshop of
26/08/99 and the Call Volume/HSH Model Workshop on 8 September.

2 Scope

The scope of this paper comprises the content of AI408, the contents of the
above paper CS/SMM/AI408, the topics contained in the draft minutes from the

above Acceptance Board meeting and the paper AI408 — HSH Service Level
Failure.

The topics can be summarised as :-

e Plan for production and implementation of additional HSH Cash Account
scripts

¢ HSH Resource Plan, comprising call volume projectiofs and HSH staffing
projections

e HSH SLA Rectification Plan

3 POCL position
Based upon the minutes of the Acceptance Board meeting of 18 August 1999,
POCL contended that:
"production of scripts is not complete"
"It does not take account of activities such as the need to train staff"
“some items have already missed dates"

"call volume projections and staffing projections contain assumptions that POCL
cannot agree based on experience to date"

On 24/08/1999 POCL also provided the paper AI-408 - HSH Service level
Failure. This supplemented the above points as follows:

Company-in-Confidence Date: 08/09/1999

e¢ POCL’s experience ‘to date is that some scripts have resulted in
inappropriate advice resulting in further calls to HSH and the National
Business Support Centre.

¢ POCL requires an explanation of how the call volume projections are
produced and the logic that supports this process.

e POCL requires that the SLA rectification plan is produced and agreed.

4 ICL Pathway position

Taking the three main topics within this AI, ICL Pathway's position can be
summarised as:-

e HSH scripting plan - The plan described in section 2 of ref. (1) remains the

basis for addressing this aspect of the Al. The Acceptance Board may not

* have been aware that actions designated for the 17" and 18th August were

completed on time. Subsequent actions within ICL Pathway and POCL

have been completed in a timely and co-operative manner from all parties

involved. The revised HSH Cash Account script document was re submitted

to POCL as Cash Account Process - ICL/PW/DSP/PRO/023 - version 2.1 -
24/08/1999.

(At the Acceptance Workshop of 26/08/99, POCL advised that there were
further comments on the scripts and a joint POCL/Pathway workshop aimed
at finalising the scripts was planned for (and was held on) 02/09/99)

e HSH Resource Plan - Call Volume prediction

ICL Pathway wish to ensure that POCL has confidence in the modelling
tools and management processes that are used to manage the Horizon
System Helpdesk in terms of staffing levels. The development of the HSH
resource model draws upon a decade of market leading experience of ICL
providing Help Desk Services to a diverse range of Clients.

Some of the key assumptions were introduced in ref. (1) and to supplement
this ICL Pathway proposed that a workshop be held with POCL to address
POCL’s concerns. A set of objectives for this event was proposed in section
5.2. This event was held 7-8/9.

The HSH has experienced a substantial increase in calls on Wednesday /
Thursday associated with outlets having difficulties in completing the Cash
Account process. This increase in business related calls was not predicted
and it is ICL Pathway's intention to establish a cash account domain of
skilled staff with the appropriate business knowledge dedicated to handling
this increase.

ICL Pathway does not consider it appropriate for these complex business
related calls to be handled within the SLA constraints of the Level 1 / Level 2
call definitions. These calls have distorted the SLA performance.

5.1.1 Future activities

Following agreement of the new scripts, and in conjunction with the
‘establishment of the cash account domain, these scripts come into operation
from 08/09/99.

It has been agreed that a joint ICL Pathway / POCL review be held on 14/09/99.
The objectives of the review will be to:

e Confirm that there has been a reduction in inappropriate advice given to
outlets

e Confirm the effectiveness of the scripts

e Review if the Cash Account call duration has become predictable and
manageable

Confir érational usability of the scripts

-continue: in “line with the recommendation in
023

5.2 HSH Resource Plan

5.2.1 Background

The development of the model to support the resource requirements of the
HSH were based on. ICL' experience in providing a wide range of
Help Desk services « ystems and ‘infrastructure call types. This.
was supplemented by a set of assumptions covering the particular call types that
ICL Pathway believed would be'génerated by POCL's outlets.

ICL Pathway successfully -applied the call volume and HSH resource model
during the period of Release 1a through to Release 1c. During this period there
was good achievement against SLA targets.

During the period’6f-LT1 it became clear that the actual call patterns diverged
from those predicted’ by’ the models. In particular there were significant
differences in call volumes following the introduction of the first Wednesday
cash account.

Following the second and subsequent cash accounts the continuing high level of
calls on Wednesday / Thursday, which had not been predicted by the model,
required that remedial action should be taken.

The resources of the HSH were supplemented by expert assistance from POCL
and Peritas (now termed KnowledgePool) who were able to successfully handle
the complex business related aspects of these Cash Account calls. This had a
beneficial impact on the call response times for the remaining calls being
handled by HSH staff,

5.2.2 Service Level Analysis *

Level 1 and Level 2 call resolution SLAs (excluding cash account calls as agreed
with POCL) met their targets in August — see table below. This progress will be
maintained throughout September and Pathway forecasts that all Helpdesk SLAs
will be met during the whole of October and beyond.

5.2.3 HSH Staffing review ;

At the 08/09/99 workshop on the Call Volume/HSH model ICL Pathway shared
with POCL the most up-to-date HSH resource plans for the remainder of 1999.
These separately identified the staffing for cash account calls. The predicted
staffing level, in terms of Full Time Equivalents, is set out below.

5.2.4 Conclusions

5.2.4.1 HSH staffing levels

From its analysis ICL Pathway believes that the HSH is sufficiently resourced
now to meet the call volumes for Level 1 and Level 2 call types. Further
resource is needed to augment performance on cash account days.

5.2.4.2, Cash Account Domain

ICL Pathway has therefore established a domain of specialist staff with the

business skills to handle Cash Account related calls. The, solution for service

levels for Cash Account calls was discussed at the workshop on 7/8 September. :
In outline, it is suggested that a quality measure is adopted and operated jointly

by Pathway and POCL NBSC such that a target of 95% conformance with the

newly agreed scripts is achieved. The measure would be by periodic inspection

or audit of all cash account calls at POCL’s convenience.

5.2.4.3 HSH Resource Planning workshop

In order to ensure that POCL share ICL Pathway’s confidence in the robustness
and flexibility of the tools and processes used in HSH Resource planning, ICL
Pathway has held a workshop with POCL to cover this topic in more detail.

The objectives of the event being: -

e To enable POCL to gain understanding and have confidence in the overall
philosophy of the call volume model and its relationship to the resource
planning model.
