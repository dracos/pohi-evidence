POL has a discrepancy with a post master regarding a transaction in Huddersfield for TPoS. The branch thought that they was
settling the transaction below to debit card but it has been ‘automatically settled to cash’. Branch thinks that that something
lent wrong with theh pinpad - debit card txn declined but the branch didn't notice.

Branch: Huddersfield 0103209
pate time: 22/03/2011 : 12.13
transaction No: 7-€71886-2.
product: 540 euros

ff Value £471.27 with sell marg
ser: CHAOO2

stock unit: BUR

n £28.63.

this was not noticed until the next day when they balanced and they then pulled off a transaction log and noticed the cash payment .I
T£S call for this was logged on the day after the transaction (23/03) and NBSC and HSD both told the PM that it was user error.

it ha:
Iretrieve the counter log for node 7 on this date and

now been raised again via TPoS introduction managers ~ Fujitsu Release managers etc. To provide a sanity check please

ee if we can add anything?

Info back to be please - I'll discuss with Adam Bowe.

Have replicated this scenario on thi

Dave Allen
SSC reference system:

Immediately after selecting "Sell Euros", MSG90092 "Transaction Prompt" appears; this states "Transactions paid for using a debit
rv credit card will require mandatory ID"
+ I note that this isn't shown in the POC log for the Huddersfield incident.

subsequently, the Clerk selected Method of Payment = "Debit Card", whereupon MSG10802 requests entry of the first 4 digits of the
card's PAN (the "Debit Card Prefix")

after entering the debit card prefix, MSG10800 "Clerk Instructions" appears; this states "Do you wish to flag this transaction as
Juspicious for anti-money laundering purposes? If you select "Yes", you must also complete and submit form P4677".
I the PM answered "No" to this.

after entering the Customer's name and ID (passport) details, the Clerk is returned to the home screen which shows the "Total Due

From Customer" = £500.00 - as would be expected.

IAt this point there is nothing to stop the Clerk settling to Fast Cash, even thought "Debit Card" had been selected earlier in the

klialogue.

Ihe POC log confirms that "Fast Cash" was indeed selected at this point. F/792/1

ffhere Is no evidence in the POC log of any PinPad interaction at any time during this session,

ro evidence of any Banking dialogue in the counter message log,
and no evidence of the session being settled “automatica in some way, rather than by action of the Clerk

ge for 540 Euros.

ly took £500 cash from the Customer, in exc!

logs can't show us whether or not the Clerk actus

1 the dialogue, but settled to Fast Cash at the end of

clusion: the Clerk selected Debit Card as the method of payment early i

the s

ssion.
