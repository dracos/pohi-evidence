lam the person named above and am currently employed by Post Office Ltd as a Field Support Officer. Part of
my duty is to visit Post Office Branches and reconcile the figures in the Post Office accounts with the physical

cash, stock and paid vouchers actually on hand in order to establish that there is no loss of Post Office funds.

Post Office Branches use a fully automated computerised accounting system known as Horizon. The Post
Office accounting system is such that each Post Office Branch produces a monthly Branch Trading Statement.
This monthly period is known as the Branch Trading Period. Each Branch Trading Period consists of either
four or five weeks, with each week running from start of business on the Thursday to close of business on the

Wednesday.

At the end of each Branch Trading Period, a Trading Statement should be printed and signed by the
Postmaster. The Trading Statement should be a true reflection of all cash and stock on hand and represent all

transactions conducted in that period.

The Horizon system is also able to produce an Office Snapshot, which summarises the state of the accounts,
including the amount of cash required for the accounts to balance, and takes into account all transactions up to

the time the snapshot was generated. An Office Snapshot can be generated at any time.

At 08.30 hrs on 30 March 2011 I attended Rowlands Castle Post Office with my colleague Mrs Sarah Juliff and
introduced ourselves to the postmaster Mrs Lynette Hutchings. Mrs Hutchings was present in the Post Office
secure area when Mrs Juliff and I conducted a full audit in respect of the cash, stock and vouchers held at that
branch. This identified a net deficit in the accounts of £9,743.76, of which £10,868.08 was due to a shortage

in the cash, £905.43 was due to a surplus in the stock, £132.10 was due to a surplus in the postage stamps
and £86.79 was due to a surplus in the foreign currency. I now produce a schedule detailing the state of the

accounts as item AS/1.

Mrs Hutchings confirmed that our figures were correct but did not offer any explanation as to why the Post
Office accounts where showing a deficit of £9,743.76. Mrs Hutchings did not make good any part of the deficit

at the time and as such the amount of £9,743.76 was posted to what is known as Late Account.

I relayed my findings to Mr Nigel Allen, Contracts Advisor who precautionary suspended Mrs Hutchings.
