Version: 2
Symptoms

100 * An unexpected error occurred while attempting to insert a message. Timeout occurred waiting for lock (0xC1090003) were detected at the
counter

Problem

The events started at 17:29 on 1-May-2002 after the counter was rebooted. The counter produced one of these messages every 10 seconds
throughout the night until Cleardesk restarted Riposte at 03:34. This cleared the lock and the system has been fine since.<br><br>Feb 2003:
<br>We are seeing a few of these each week, on Wednesdays during balancing. This can lead to problems if the PM is balancing on the counter
generating the events, as it may not have a full view of transactions done on other counters. PC0086212 sent to development.<br><br>June
2004:<br>This event can also give rise to Transfer problems, where the eventing Node was not replicating and so allowed Clerk to Transfer In [TI] of
a txn which had already been TI on another Node for the second time or an Existing Reversal [ER] of the Tl. See details on call E-0406030482 /
PC0103864.<br><br>Sept 2005:<br>This problem is still occurring every week, in one case at the same site on 2 consecutive weeks. PC0126376
sent to development.

Solution - Helpdesk

This problem seems to be cleared by either rebooting the affected counter or Cleardesk running in the morning.<br><br><b>SMC: If the event is
seen at a multi-counter office during the working hours of the PO, or up to 18:00 on a weekday (in case they are balancing out-of-hours), RING THE
OFFICE AND GET THEM TO REBOOT the eventing counter. If they are in the process of balancing, it is strongly advised that they reboot before
continuing with balancing as they are at risk of producing an incorrect balance. Warn the PM that if transactions appear to be missing, they should
not be re-entered - they will become visible after the counter has been rebooted.</b><br><br>If a reboot/Cleardesk does not resolve this problem,
send the call over for further investigation - SSC can rebuild the messagestore on the affected counter.<br><br><b>Update: 11/01/2010 Peak
PC0193012</b><br><br>If the message was seen on a Correspondence server and the source of the message is Riposte then raise a Peak call and
route it to SSC to stop and restart the Riposte service under OCP. If the errors are seen on more than one Correspondence server at the same time
then further investigations should be carried out.<br>
