Both! But the former! — He was a Post Office ‘lifer’ and left/retired - he then came back as a contractor in 2022 and
was then exited in mid-2023. He is now not here.

Thanks for the quick reply. Just to clarify the order of play with BT — he came back as a contractor and was
then exited in mid 2023 so he’s not there now? Or he exited 2023 and then came back as a contractor?

BT exited (by me) mid 2023 — he gave evidence at the Inquiry late 2022(?). Previously he had been a Contract
Manager - hence why he was called as a witness — but after leaving Post Office he came back as a contractor in RU but
not in a role with any influence/decision making — purely admin.

Will look into MJ — not a name that is familiar and can’t find him on the global address list. Leave with me.
Response to Chris Hodges note to Nick should go today/tomorrow latest. It’s from me but Nick R is checking it.
The note makes my services available if helpful on this matter on the 17" June.

Regards

Simon

Hi Simon
This from Richard Moorhead:

An SPM approached me worried that two staff involved in Horizon matters pre-Bates are, have
been, or may be involved in redress. Brian Trotter And Mervyn Jones.

Helpful to know where these stand please.
