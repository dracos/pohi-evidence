Subject: Programme Name Change
Colin,

Peter Corbett has re-named the End-to-End programme. It is now to be known as the
Impact Programme, standing from IMProved ACcounTing. No doubt it will take a while
for the new name to settle into everyday usage, but we should start using it in
commercial and contractual documents wherever the name of the Programme.needs to be
referenced. I don't intend to change the MoU or 3-way NDA, nor any work packages
that are approved or are with Post Office for approval, but suggest we should use
the new name in all new work packages, commercial terms and related documents, and
conform those currently being drafted.

Regards,

Keith Baines
