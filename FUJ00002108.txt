1. Introduction

This document is the interface specification (IS) between Post Office Limited and
Fujitsu Services for the delivery of EMV PIN Pad reference data for Retail.

The document production has been authorised under Change Work Package 172.
Other related change documents are

e CRO00113 — Provision of support from FS in the Development of an ‘AIS’ for
Type C reference data for Banking II

e CP3657 — Development of ‘AIS’ for Type C reference data for EMV

Retail PIN Pad reference data is divided into two parts for the purposes of change
management: -

e Reference data that is agreed as part of the EMV implementation at S70 and
that is not considered to be subject to subsequent business change. It may be
changed only through a change request.

e Reference data that is subject to regular business change and, therefore,
changes to it must be supported under the operational business change (OBC)
process.

This document is concerned primarily with defining the scope, format and delivery
process for the reference data changes that are supported by OBC.

For completeness, Appendix A of the document defines the PIN Pad reference data
that is outside the scope of OBC.

2. Scope

The document defines the reference data that is to be supplied by Post office Limited
to support the Hypercom Financial Terminal (HFT) for Retail.

The document consists of
e Section 3 provides an overview of Hypercom PIN Pad reference data.

e Section 4 identifies the new OBC events and provides estimates of volumes for
each event.

e Section 5 defines the PIN Pad reference data to be supplied by Post Office Ltd
under OBC.

e Appendix A defines the PIN pad reference data that is out of scope for OBC.

3. Hypercom PIN Pad Reference Data
3.1 Data Tables

Hypercom PIN Pad reference data consists of a number of data tables. The full set
of tables is as follows: -

Table Name Description

General This table contains only one entry that defines
data applicable to the Retail application. This
consists of attributes such as country code,
currency terminal capabilities, floor and ceiling
limits

Acquirer This table contains an entry for each acquirer. It
defines attributes such as acquirer identifier,
acquirer facilities, acquirer floor and ceiling limits
Card Scheme This table contains an entry for each card scheme.
It defines attributes such as issuer identifier and
name, card element positions, scheme floor limit
and terminal action codes.

lIN This table contains an entry for each IIN range. It
defines low and high range value, PAN length and
whether the IIN is for debit or credit cards

AID This table contains an entry for each ICC
application that is supported. It defines the
application identifier, application versions
supported and application controls. It contains the
key to each of the application data object tables —
TDOL, DDOL, Additional Data

TDOL This is the Application Transaction Certificate Data
Object List. It contains an entry for each ICC
application that uses TDOLs.

DDOL This is the Application Dynamic Data
Authentication Object List It contains an entry for
each ICC application that uses DDOLs.

Additional Data This table contains lists of additional data tags that
are to be applied to card schemes for the
associated application. It contains an entry for
each ICC application that uses Additional Data.

Public Key This table contains public keys for each registered
application provider (RID)
Public Key Revocation This table contains public key revocations for

registered application provider (RID)

3.2. Data Table Relationships

3.2.1 Overview
The following data tables are stand-alone with no data relationship to other tables: -

General
PED Messages

The Acquirer, Card Scheme and IIN tables are a hierarchy with an Acquirer having
one or more Card Schemes and each Card Scheme having one or more IIN.

RID (Registered Application Provider Identifier) is the ICC application provider and
the owner of all Public Keys for the application. RID is not a data table in its own right -
the RID is the first part of the AID (Application identifier)

Public Keys may be revoked by Public Key Revocations. An AID may have a

5. PIN Pad Reference Data Delivery under OBC

5.1 Delivery Process

Based on the estimated low volume of change the cost of developing an automated
interface between Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu services is not considered justified.
Instead, Post Office Ltd will provide details of PIN Pad reference data changes to
Fujitsu Services in document form.

Post Office Ltd will provide Fujitsu Services with advance notification of an OBC -
meeting the appropriate lead times as required for the actual OBC event. Post Office
Ltd will liaise with the Financial Institution(s) (Fl) to obtain documentation of the
required reference data changes. Post Office Ltd will then supplement the FI
documentation with documentation of any further data definition that is required to
provide the complete set of PIN Pad reference data to support the OBC. The
documentation will specify the OBC reference that the reference data change applies
to and will provide complete details, as defined in this interface specification, of all
reference data table entries that are new, changed or are to be deleted.

The full change documentation will then be delivered to the Fujitsu Services
Reference Data Team (RDT). The document will be emailed to RDT.
5.2. Definition of Data Types

The following table defines the data types used within the Hypercom PIN Pad
reference data for field format definitions: -

Data Type I Description
AN Alphanumeric ASCII characters including space
N Numeric ASCH characters.
HEX Hexadecimal — some PIN Pad reference data (e.g.

Public Keys) is in Binary. However, it is to be
delivered in HEX and then converted to Binary
prior to loading to the PIN Pad. Character set is 0-

5.3.2.1 Card Scheme Table

This table contains an entry for each issuer card scheme for each acquirer. Because
the table contains attributes that are at the POL RDS bank card level, the table entries
will correspond to Bank Card within the POL RDS system rather than to Issuer
Scheme. Initial volume estimate is 5 entries. Maximum volume is 99 entries.

The OBC documentation will provide details of all table entries that are to be created,
amended or deleted.
