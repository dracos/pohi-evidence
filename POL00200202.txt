Hi Angela,

Sorry I missed your call. If you could:
¢ Review the two docs attached and track your changes (one is the full media Q&A , the other is a brief for us to use
internally)
e — Review notes from Jarnail so we can answer the questions (if asked by the media)
© (1) what is the Post Office prosecution policy?
© (2) why have you dropped cases?

Thanks Angela —I appreciate your help on this.

From Jarnail:

Each case is considered individually . I would suggest the following wording :

Whilst POL has as matter of policy treats offences of theft and fraud seriously ,following any investigation it remains
appropriate for Lawyers to consider each case on its own facts, having regards to the facts of each case and the code
for crown prosecutors.

I would suggest formulation of wording such as to why POL are not proceeding with prosecutions Abbas and
Daw.

e Issues arising out of the Selsey Road Post Office in Birmingham have been investigated.

e In order to consider whether or not to commence a prosecution against Abbas and Daw POL has
had regard to the two tests set out in The Code for Crown Prosecutors.

e = The first test to be considered is the evidential test and if there is sufficient evidence to justify a
prosecution, prosecutors must then go on to consider whether a prosecution is required in the public
interest.

e The evidence in this case has been reviewed and POL has decided that a prosecution in relation to
Abbas and Daw is not required in the public interest.

I would suggest formulation of wording such as to why POL are not proceeding with prosecution against Rees;
e Mr. Rees was investigated following the discovery of a shortage of cash by auditors.
e The Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out two tests; the evidential test and, if that is satisfied, the
public interest test.
e The evidence in this case has been fully reviewed and it has been concluded that there is insufficient
evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction at this time.
e Hope this helps.
