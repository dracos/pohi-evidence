2. Legislation

2.1 PNC checks will only be made for the following purposes :-

To assist Security Managers with the investigation of specific criminal
offences against Post Office Ltd.

In order to carry out risk assessments for health and safety purposes on
identified occupants of premises/ places of residence / vehicles which are
to be searched/ or subject of an operation carried out by Post Office Ltd
as part of a criminal enquiry.

Obtaining the previous convictions of alleged offenders and witnesses
who have provided a written statement, in cases being prosecuted or
under active consideration for prosecution by Post Office Ltd.

To establish the outcome of a Police prosecution where the offence is
against Post Office Ltd.

To identify the registered keeper of a vehicle that is suspected of being
involved in criminal activity against Post Office Ltd.

To identify registered vehicles at an address that is associated with a
known suspect, who is suspected of being involved in criminal offences
against Post Office Ltd.

To assist with the gathering of intelligence of vehicles used in criminal
offences against Post Office Ltd., for example suspected criminal activity
against Cash & Valuables in Transit or Cash Centre Depots.

2.2 Accessing the PNC must comply with :-

°

coo eoe

Section 29 of the Data Protection Act 1998, on the grounds of ‘Public
Interest’ for the purposes of the prevention/detection of crime and the
apprehension and prosecution of offenders.

The Computer Misuse Act 1990.

The Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988.

The ACPO Code of Practice for Data Protection.

The ‘Supply Agreement’ between Post Office Ltd Security and NPIA.

Post Office Ltd Security Operating Procedures.

2.3 For the purposes of Subject Access Requests, Post Office Ltd is not a Data
Controller. The Data Controller for information held on the PNC is the Police
Force or organisation that either created or last updated the particular
record. NPIA act as a data processor.

2.4 It is criminal offence to perform ‘fishing trips’ on the PNC, for example
conducting a PNC check on all individuals at a branch when only one person is
suspected of a criminal offence.

2.5.1

2.5.2

Post Office Ltd Information Classification Standards to be adhered to in
respect of PNC data:

CONFIDENTIAL Information that should only be shared with staff, agents and
contractors who have a need to know. Any sharing of information with third
parties, except disclosure for the purpose of disciplinary proceedings or
disclosure during court proceedings, must be carried out under a Non-
Disclosure Agreement (NDA). (Almost all requested PNC data falls into this
category (see ‘Strictly Confidential’ for exceptions) — Confidential Information
is deemed to be of a sensitive nature and likely to cause damage following
unauthorised disclosure.)

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Information that must be strictly controlled and
limited to a minimal list of nominated individuals. The information owner is
responsible for permitting access to information, controlling the list of
nominated recipients and managing the disseminated information. (- Strictly
Confidential Information meets the classification standards of government
departments, the security services or clients, or is deemed to be so sensitive
that unauthorised disclosure would cause acute organisational damage

Security of PNC Data

3.1

3.2

3.3

3.4

3.5

3.6

3.7

The PNC system is protectively marked as RESTRICTED in line with the
Government Protective Marking Scheme. To comply with Post Office
equivalent standards, ‘Post Office — Confidential’ will be used with all PNC
requested data. In exceptional circumstances with approval from one of the
Senior Security Managers, it may be deemed necessary to categories specific
PNC requested data as ‘Post Office - Strictest Confidential’. (See Section 2 for
details of Post Office Information Security Standards)

It is important to remember that the PNC is not a Post Office Ltd computer
system. This means that staff must exercise great care to ensure that abuses
do not take place, such as using the computer for personal use or non-PNC
related work.

ACPO have the right to withdraw the use of PNC from Post Office Ltd if there
is a reason to believe it has been misused.

Two important rules are :-

@ ONLY use PNC data for official use
@ NEVER pass PNC data to those who do not need to see it, or discuss the
data with such people.

The security arrangements for PNC are required to be compatible with those
of ACPO. This is designed to protect :-

¢@ Confidentiality — Ensuring that PNC information is disclosed only to
authorised users for legitimate purposes

@ Integrity — Ensuring there is no unauthorised access, deletion or alteration
of the PNC data.

@ Availability — Ensuring the PNC service is available when required.

When logging on to the PNC terminal, operators must always check the last
logon date and time. These should correspond with the last session
conducted by that user. If the date and time does not match (e.g. a logon
was shown for yesterday and you were on leave that day) then this should be
reported immediately to the Security Programme Manager responsible for
PNC

PNC Grapevine Operators must not demonstrate the PNC to anyone not
authorised to use the PNC system, without the prior approval of the NPIA.

3.8 The building where the PNC terminal is sited, is accessed controlled, with
either personal access identification cards that provide controlled access, or
via a manned reception during normal office hours. Beyond the reception,
access is gained via personal swipe card access. The PNC terminal is then
located within the inner room inside the alarm receiving centre, which is
access controlled 24/7/365 by the inner secure room controller via siphon
door access. Access to the small room the PNC terminal is located is secured
when the PNC system is in use, thereby excluding all non PNC authorised
persons.

3.9 The terminal must stay at its location as agreed at the inception of PNC
access. Terminals can be moved when, for example, offices are relocated,
but a member of the NPIA Information Assurance Team must be contacted to
authorise the proposed location, prior to the move.

3.10 Under no circumstances must any form of removable media be used to
download or upload data to or from the PNC or the terminal. Definitions of
removable media include: floppy disks, any form of CD media, Zip disks,
removable hard disk drives or similar and any form of solid state device e.g.
USB pen drives.

3.11 Only pre-installed, authorised software may be used on the PNC terminal. It
must not be used as a general office machine.

3.12 This document should be read and understood by all PNC users. This should
be recorded using Appendix A and must be periodically re-signed within a
time frame of no more than one year, which is being set at the end of July
each year.

4. Access and Training

41 Only officially trained users may access the PNC. All training is undertaken
through NPIA-ICTLP (the national Police trainers) or NPIA-ICTLP approved
trainers. Informal training, such as shadowing an established user, without
attending an official training course beforehand, is expressly forbidden.

4.2 All requests for PNC information, must apply using the dedicated internal
information request form, currently titled POL208. All requests must be
approved by the Authorising Manager which includes one of the Security
Operations Team Leaders or a member of the Security Lead Team (which are
all at least one grade above the PNC requestor).

4.3 PNC Authorising Managers, must on an annual basis read and abide by the
‘PNC Authorising Managers Instructions Policy’ to confirm all PNC requests
are in accordance to the standards set out by the PNC Security Operations
Manual. (See Appendix I). Frequency is set on the first occasion for
September 2012, then by the end of July thereafter.

User IDs and Passwords

User IDs

5.1

5.2

5.3

The PNC User ID is unique to the operator. It determines the parts of the
system the PNC Operators are entitled to access and identifies the operator
to the system for audit purposes. Therefore, all operators must closely guard
their password.

This still applies if a user is required to contact Hendon Data Centre; whilst a
user ID can be revealed and indeed be guessed, the password must never be
given to a third party, no matter how seemingly legitimate they may be.

PNC users are fully accountable for all actions undertaken with their User ID.
User IDs must be deleted when :-

Employment is ceased

The user moves to another department and no longer requires access
Extended sick leave

Maternity leave

Secondment

oeoee

Unfortunately, it is not possible to disable a user ID and reinstate it when the
owner returns.

User IDs must be recorded on Appendix D

Passwords

5.4

5.5

5.6

5.7

Users will be allocated a password when they first gain access to the PNC.
The system will prompt the PNC Operator to change the password upon first
access.

PNC passwords expire at 45-day intervals after the initial logon and password
change. The system will prompt the user to change their password ten days
prior to the expiry date.

It is good practice to change a password prior to not requiring access for an
extended period. This should counter any unnoticed security breach whilst

the user is away due to leave or secondment.

The PNC enforces rules on password composition, these are :-

POL00105229

5.8

5.9

@ Minimum of six, maximum of eight characters, which must be alpha-
numeric (no spaces or punctuation symbols).

@ No more than two consecutive identical characters

¢# Acombination of letters and numbers

@ Not the same as the user ID

It is also good practice to use passwords that are not easily linked to the PNC
operator - for example, your birthday or car registration number.

If it is suspected that your password has been discovered, the password must
changed immediately and then log a security breach with the Security
Programme Manager responsible for PNC, who will in turn raise this with the
NPIA. You must ensure that transactions conducted with the compromised
user ID are audited to ascertain whether any breaches have occurred.

lf you forget your password, it must be reset. Contact the Security
Programme Manager responsible for PNC with the password request,
completing Appendix E — Password Reset.

The PNC will bar a user ID if the corresponding password is entered
incorrectly three times. The following message will be displayed if this has
happened :-

‘Too many unsuccessful log on attempts. This User ID is being barred’

If you attempt to log on after this has happened the following message will
be displayed:-

‘User ID is barred — Contact Security Administrator’

If this happens you should contact the Security Programme Manager
responsible for PNC

If three invalid user ID attempts are made the terminal will be locked out.
This is to prevent unlawful access if the physical security of the terminal
becomes compromised. If this happens, the following message will be
displayed :-

‘Too many invalid log on attempts. This terminal is locked out’

If this happens you should contact the Security Programme Manager
responsible for PNC

Security of PNC Prints

Scanned Prints: PNC prints are scanned and sent as an e-mail attachment to
the relevant requesting Security Manager. The following form of words is
sent with each e-mail that has a PNC print as an attachment. ‘The PNC print
attached to this e-mail contains “Post Office - Confidential” information and
is provided on the understanding that it is managed with due regard to its’
sensitive nature. The information provided should only be used to assist with
the Post Office Ltd Security Manager specified by the requester and should
not be shared outside the Security Team or appointed persons involved with
the case.. The ‘PNC print/s’ attachment within this e-mail must be printed off
immediately on receipt and the attachment then deleted. The printed copy
must be securely filed with the relevant casework. Failure of an individual to
delete a file or to forward a file without authority may be in breach of our PNC
Security Operating Procedures and could instigate the conduct code (the level
of misconduct dependant on severity of breach, which may lead to dismissal).
If you have received this message in error, you must not view the attachment.
Instead, please return the e-mail to the sender and delete this e-mail message
from your system’

The criteria and process detailed below are followed when scanning PNC
prints to minimise the risks of compromising the PNC data.

The image of the scanned print is deleted from the scanner / PC, immediately
after attaching the scanned print to the relevant e-mail.

The scanned print is deleted from the computer of the PNC operator dealing
with the request, once the e-mail with the scanned print as an attachment
has been sent.

Once the e-mail with the scanned PNC print has been sent to the requesting
Security Manager, the e-mail and attachment are deleted by the PNC
operator from their computer.

In exceptional circumstances, where the scanning process is not appropriate
and a printed copy is being sent by post or fax, the printouts must be
protectively marked at ‘Post Office - Confidential’ in line with the Post Office
Ltd Information Security Standards (see section 2).

PNC prints must only be sent to Security Managers when necessary and when
sending a scanned print is not an option. .

All PNC prints must be marked ‘Post Office - Confidential’

PNC prints must not be distributed for vetting purposes.

6.5

Data from PNC prints must not be disclosed outside the Security Team or
appointed persons directly linked with the investigation, without first
obtaining relevant senior manager approval, who will seek approval for
disclosure from the National Policing Improvement Agency, if the request is
considered appropriate.

If PNC prints need to be distributed as single items (as opposed to within
dossiers/case files etc.) then the procedure detailed below should be
followed.

PNC prints must be sent double enveloped. The inner envelope should be
sealed and marked ‘Post Office - Confidential’. The outer envelope should be
without protective marking and sent by Special Delivery.

Faxes should only be sent in matters of extreme urgency and agreement
obtained from one of the Authorising Mangers before doing so.

If distribution is by fax: a known fax number and established contact should
be used, additionally the recipient should be on hand. The fax number must
be a recognised and official contact number. The image must then be
deleted from the fax machine.

PNC Prints left lying around can be easily read by anyone entering the office
and therefore give rise to accidental disclosure. If this happens, you have
disclosed the data and, the conduct code may be instigated (level dependant
on severity, which may include dismissal). If deemed an intentional disclosure
then you may be liable to prosecution

Storage

All documents relating to PNC are protectively marked at ’Post Office —
Confidential’, as such, all documents should be treated in the same way as
other RESTRICTED documents. For both government and non-government
organisations this means protected by one barrier, e.g. in a locked container
within a secure building.

The SecureDial token, PIN, if applicable and server password, if applicable,
will be shared by all PNC terminal users. These items may be stored in one
place so long as access is restricted to PNC terminal users.

Disposal

Documents marked at ‘Post Office — Confidential’ should be disposed of by
tearing into pieces so that reconstitution is unlikely and deposited within the
sensitive waste container or shredded.

Operational Procedures

The PNC terminal has been provided to facilitate in the investigation of
internal Post Office Ltd incidents & potential criminal activity against Post
Office Ltd as prescribed in section 2.1. All requests are made by members of
the Security Team during the process of pulling final cases together prior to
court appearances (although some cases may be closed and therefore not
reach court) or potential criminal activity against Post Office Ltd. (for example
potential criminal activity against Cash & Valuables in Transit or Cash Centre
Depots).

For all standard requests for PNC checks, form POL208 must be completed,
authorised and e-mailed to the ‘Post Office Security’ email box (then
forwarded to Post Office Grapevine). It is important to ensure that all
available details are entered on the form in accordance with the instructions
contained on the POL208 form. The form must come from the e-mail account
of a recognised authorising manager, which is either one of the Security
Operations Team Leaders or a member of the Senior Lead Team i.e. a
manager at least one grade above the requester, including the words ‘I
authorise this PNC check for (enter name of individual)’ and include the
original e-mail from the requester. (Names of all Authorising Mangers are
kept with the PNC terminal).

For all urgent PNC checks, the Grapevine Team will accept requests made
over the telephone as follows;

In all instances, full details must be provided and the reason for the check
explained.

Details should include the name of the manager authorising the request.

The PNC information is telephoned back to the requestor using the
recognised and official contact number.

The Grapevine Operator will complete the POL208 form and e-mail it to the
Authorising Manager who must complete the authorisation boxes on the
individual check form and return the form to the Grapevine Team e-mail
address (and cc Post Office Security to enable consolidation of casework
paperwork) within 5 working days in order to comply with Post Office Ltd
Security Operating Procedures

The Authorising Manager should ensure the subject line is marked ‘Urgent
PNC Check’ and the e-mail states ‘I authorise PNC check for (enter name of
individual)’.

When providing the reason for the request, it is important to bear in mind
that our usage of the PNC is subject to external audit conducted by NPIA. A
brief, but detailed reason should be given which will provide an external
auditor (with no background knowledge of the case) an understanding of why
the check was necessary. PNC requests must as a minimum contain the
reasons for the request with evidence of some of the points listed in section
2.1 of this policy (i.e. purposes PNC checks are permitted for) to ensure the
purposes of the request is to combat criminality against Post Office Ltd.

The Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) stipulates the main considerations that
must be taken into account before ‘public authorities’ can be allowed to
interfere with the right to privacy. The operation of PNC is subject to HRA,
which places an obligation on those using the powers to ensure that the
check requested is fully and clearly justified. The Authorising Officer must
ensure that any check meets HRA requirements and that use of the check is
proportionate to the outcome being sought. Investigations should cause
minimum interference with the rights of an individual and be necessary,
justifiable, legal and proportionate.

PNC individual checks cannot be conducted for the following reasons: -

Checking the criminal record of individuals suspected of criminal offences
where Post Office Ltd or appointed agent is not the victim or loser. For
example, suspected use and/or supply of controlled substances such as
drugs.

‘Fishing trips’ — Checking a number of individuals where there is no justified
reason, for example, other individuals who could not have had access
because they were not on duty or in the branch at the time of the incident.

Checking of individuals due to reports on their appearance or behaviour, for
example, unsubstantiated suspicions.

For all vehicle PNC checks a POL208 form must be completed, authorised and
e-mailed to the Post Office Security Team e-mail address. It is important to
ensure that all details on the form have been completed and the instructions
contained on the POL208 form followed. The form must be sent from the e-
mail account of the authorising manager. (Including the words ‘I authorise
this PNC check for’ enter the vehicle reg number and include the original e-
mail from the requester).

For all urgent PNC vehicle checks, requests made over the telephone to the
Grapevine Team are acceptable. Request should be made as follows:

Full details must be provided and the reason for the request given.

The Grapevine Team will complete the POL208 form and e-mail the form to
the authorising manager, who must complete the authorisation boxes and
return the form using their own e-mail account to the Grapevine Team e-mail
address within five working days (and cc Post Office Security to enable
consolidation of case files)

It is important to ensure the subject line is marked ‘urgent PNC check’ and
the e-mail states ‘I authorise PNC Check for’ enter vehicle registration’.

PNC vehicle checks cannot be conducted for the following reasons:-

‘Fishing trips’, i.e. - checking a number of vehicles when there is not any
justified reason. This would also include the checking of vehicles, which may
be parked near to a suspect address or where a criminal incident occurred,
but there is no information/intelligence to suggest the vehicles are involved
in criminal activity against Post Office Ltd

Vehicles not involved in criminal activity against Post Office Ltd.

To identify the ownership of vehicles in accordance with the proceeds of
Crime Act, 2002.

PNC DISCLOSURE — INDIVIDUAL CHECK

All PNC data will be disclosed for an intelligence check — current convictions,
impending prosecutions, spent convictions, cautions and warnings. A
description of the individual will also be sent to the requestor.

Spent convictions are to be used for intelligence purposes only as these
convictions are governed by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. Under
no circumstances should spent convictions be disclosed to unauthorised
personnel. As these spent convictions are for intelligence use they should
only be disclosed on a ‘need to know basis’ only within Post Office Ltd
Security.

Where there is uncertainty as to whether the PNC result is that of the
individual details provided, contact must be made to the requestor for
verification. It is the responsibility of the Security Manager to check the PNC
printout against the subject details in order to verify the information. If it
transpires, a print-out is of the wrong person, the PNC print must be disposed
of by shredding.

The frequency of audits will depend on the amount of transactions. If there
is an average of more than 100 transactions per day, a daily audit will be
required, reporting weekly. For less regular use, a weekly audit, reporting
monthly will be appropriate.

The auditor will produce a #TE print of all transactions carried out during the
audit period. This should include all periods over a day/week/month. For
example, a weekly audit transaction report, the print should show the period
Monday 0000 hours through to Sunday 2359 hours.

All current PNC operator transactions should be subject to audit.

the following:

11. Incident Management

All breaches of this policy and security incidents must be managed
appropriately. All breaches will be notified to ACPO via the NPIA.

A breach of policy is defined as any action that contravenes the spirit or word
of this document. A security incident is where actual misuse or compromise
of the PNC or its data has occurred. A breach of policy may or may not lead
to a security incident. For example, leaving the PNC terminal logged on and
unattended is a breach of policy but it may not result in an incident. If the
terminal left unattended is used by an unauthorised person, then an incident
has occurred. In this example, if only the breach of policy has occurred, it can
be handled entirely in-house. If the incident had occurred, it must be notified
to the NPIA.

The following types of incident must be notified to the NPIA without delay:

any unauthorised Names check;

any unauthorised Vehicle check;

any unauthorised disclosure of PNC data — accidental or malicious;

any unauthorised modification or deletion of a PNC record;

any instance of using the PNC for an unauthorised purpose;

any other misuse of the PNC, which could result in harm or

VVVVV WV

embarrassment to an individual or which could lead to adverse publicity
for the organisations involved.

All breaches will be reported to the Head of Security via the Senior Security
Manager to determine appropriate disciplinary actions.

In line with the above, breaches and incidents should be notified to the NPIA
Information Assurance Manager, who will assist the investigation if required.
You must keep the NPIA Information Assurance Manager up-to-date with the
investigation and submit a full report at its conclusion.
