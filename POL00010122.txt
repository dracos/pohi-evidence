REF: Mrs Rooprit Gill - CRM/264834/JSX

Further to your memo dated 07 May 2010 and our telephone conversation on 09 July 2010, I am
returning the case file to you today, for advice on bringing criminal charges against Mrs Gilt. As
discussed with you today, I have obtained witness staternents from the 3 customers in respect of
the £2,500, £2,075.57 and £71.00 A&L deposits. Copies of these 3 statements are associated at
Appendix A.

Associated at Appendix B, is a copy of item HW/1 (see Ward statement for full explanation), which
is a Post Office card account receipt for 18/08/09, the day that Ms Ward made her £71.00 deposit,
which wasn’t processed on Horizon. I also associate at Appendix B, an extract from the Credence
database, showing HW/1 entered at 09.15 hrs by RGIO05 but not the £71.00 A&L deposit. I would
need to obtain Horizon data from Fujitsu should it subsequently be needed to produce this data.

As mentioned in our telephone call, I have firstly telephoned the local branch of Lloyds TSB and
then written to them to request under DPA, contact details of Mr Lama in respect of the £11,620
cheque processed on Horizon 2 minutes before the arrival of the audit team. The reverse of the
cheque was annotated NS&I Income Bonds. I have spoken to Stan Zure, NS&l Fraud Section, who
has advised that there is no record of any Mr S Lama in the Birmingham area having any Income
Bonds, or any other NS&I bonds, stocks or accounts.

There does appear to be some difficulty in proving at this stage that Mrs Gill is the person who has
stolen the money, although my belief is that she has. The difficulty being, her ‘no comment’
response to the majority of questions put to her at intervi id th ible implication that her

Whether or not Mrs Gill has stolen the money herself, it would seem apparent that she has played
a key role in concealing the deficit in this branch, namely by not processing lottery transactions and
not amending her scratchcard on hand figures when receiving TC's, despite being suspended for
this previously. There is also the £10,000 remittance that wasn’t found at audit but then ‘found’ by
Mrs Gill a few days later, as well as the A&L deposits, of which Mrs Than is sure that she was
served by a middle age Asian lady when depositing the £2,500 on 10 June 2009.

In view of the above you may feel that fraud charges covering 06 November 2008 (date Mrs Gill
was previously re-instated) to 19 August 2009 (date of audit) are more fitting than theft charges.
You may also feel that it would be appropriate to formulate a single charge at this stage, for the
total amount of £38,026.57, which I am investigating, although as stated in my initial report, there
is further debt against Mrs Gill, which wasn’t brought to our attention at the time and Mrs Gill was
re-instated.

give consideration to formulating charges by close of play Tuesday 13 July; in order that Andy

Hayward can give authority to proceed and that I can fax charges in advance to custody at Thornhill
