Scott Darlington - Alderley Edge, Debt outstanding £44,193.46
This is one of our top 5 cases that I have recommended that we proceed on but I am awaiting a risk analysis and cost
estimate from Bond Pearce on the top 5 cases (this was covered in a discussion with Susan when she visited with
Alwen)

     GRO      i— Blackwood —We do not hold a case on this, it is time expired.
The debtwas written off Nov 2004 (£436,317.31) there is an email on the EFC that suggests it was not in the best interest
of the business to pursue as the Fl could not find further assets. The branch also had property debt of £49,005.10 (Email
from Jean Reynolds 20.1.2006) that property holdings were looking into recovering as there was sufficient equity in the
house, but I am not aware if this was pursued.

Sorry not to have more information
Kind regards Alison

I have compared the list of branches against the known cases being fronted by Shoosmiths. 3 of the 5 cases formally
notified to POL fall within the constituencies of one of the 37 MPs due to attend the meeting:-

 Branch                      Subpostmaster                      Constituency         MP                   Party
 Alderley Edge PO            Scott Darlington                   Tatton               George Osborne       Conservative
 Astwood Bank PO             Julian Wilson                      Redditch             Karen Lumley         Conservative
 Merthyr Tydfil PO                     GRO                      Merthyr Tydfil and   Dai Havard           Labour
                             _.-._._._.-._.-.-.-.-.-.-._..._.
                                                                Rhymney

I have set out a summary of the facts below. I have taken some of this information from the letters prepared by
Shoosmiths, but have not had an opportunity to verify it.

Scott Darlington

    •     SPM was appointed on 25 March 2005.
    •     Audit carried out on 12 February 2009. SPM suspended for inflating on-hand cash declarations by c.E44k.
    •     Pleaded guilty to 5 counts of false accounting based upon cash declarations made between September 2008 and
          February 2009.
    •     Debt of c.£44k remains outstanding in full.
    •     Letter before action sent by Shoosmiths on 16 August 2011. It is alleged by the SPM that he was compelled to
          make the false declarations by virtue of economic duress and that the offences resulted from the unfairness of the
          system devised for use by SPM's and/or as a result of errors generated by the Horizon system itself. As a result,
          the SPM claims that POL was not entitled to terminate his appointment and consequently POL is liable for the
          wrongful termination of his contract. The SPM claims damages of c.£150k.
    •     It is alleged that (a) the training provided was inadequate, (b) the helpl ine provided by POL was unfairly difficult to
          access due to both its hours of operation and the insufficiency of operators to deal with the level of demand
          placed on the service, (c) the Horizon system suffers with inherent defects and/or an unfair system of operation
          and (d) the standard operating procedures used by POL make it impossible to properly reconcile errors.
    •     Liability has been denied on the basis that the SPM can have no claim for wrongful termination in circumstances
          where he has committed fraud. POL has not responded to each individual allegation.
    •     There has been no correspondence on this matter since December 2011.
    •     There are no live court proceedings in play.



    •     SPM was appointed on 6 November 2002.
    •     In or around May 2003 an audit took place. A small discrepancy was found and made good.
    •     On 11 September 2008 a further audit took place. The auditors were advised that there would be a shortfal l of
          c.£27k. A shortfall of £27,811.98 was identified and the SPM was suspended.
    •     On 15 June 2009 the SPM pleaded guilty to two charges of false accounting. He was made subject to a
          confiscation order and the debt has been paid in full.
    •     Letter before action sent by Shoosmiths on 23 August 2011. The issues raised in that letter are more or less
          identical to those set out in Darlington.
    •     Liabil ity has been denied on the same basis as in Darlington.



                                                                                                                       POL-0054470
                                                                                                                    POL00057991
                                                                                                                 POL00057991



       •     There has been no correspondence on this matter since December 2011.
       •     There are no live court proceedings in play.


[._._._._._G.RO_._._ _.
       •     SPM between June 1997 and 7 July 2005. Prior to this she had been an employee of POL working as a cashier
             and substitute / relief manager in a Crown PO.
       •     It appears that the branch was audited on 23 September 2004. The total amount of the discrepancies stood at
             £425k. She was suspended and ultimately terminated by letter dated 19 January 2005.
       •     The SPM was interviewed under caution in respect of allegations of theft. It does not appear that any criminal
             proceedings were commenced.
       •     The SPM appealed the decision to terminate her contract and it appears that she was re-instated, albeit she
             remained on suspension. It also appears that POL wrote to her on 30 June 2005 inviting her to resign, which she
             did on 14 July 2005.
       •     Court proceedings were commenced in June 2011 and served on POL in October 2011. A letter before action
             was served on 23 December 2011. The allegations made are in almost identical terms to the claims made in both
             the Darlington and Wilson cases.
       •     This claim has been struck out on the basis of procedural error and the SPM is now time barred from bringing
             any future claims.

I hope the above is helpful. If you need more information, let me know.
