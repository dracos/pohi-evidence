sorry for the delayed response. The integrity of data is fully understood by Fujitsu's team and they will
not do anything to compromise it.

A simple explanation of the method being used to correct the data is:

* We use a clean copy of the database in the primary datacentre

+ We apply a fix to correct the indexing issues from today

+ We apply the transactions into the database at the primary site (clean and reindexed).

This way there is no manual intervention and the data remains as per transacted in branch.

Dave

Is there a risk involved in correcting the transactions before we revert to the primary data centre?

How does this work? Is there any manual intervention? Are we happy that this will have no impact to the
integrity of the system?

Thx,

Kevin

transactions in the database need correcting before we can start the fallback process to the primary data
centre. The volume of transactions has reached the point where the time it will take to correct them will
eat into our fallback time and consequently could impact the service provided tomorrow.
