Dear Shirine,
Letter of appointment

Following the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, the board of
directors (Board) of Post Office Limited (Company) is pleased to hear that you
have accepted our offer to join the Board as an independent non-executive
director (NED).

This letter sets out the terms of your appointment as a NED of Post Office
Limited.

By accepting this appointment, you agree that this letter is a contract for
services and is not a contract of employment and you confirm that you are not
subject to any restrictions which prevent you from holding office as a director.

1. APPOINTMENT

1.1. Subject to the remaining provisions of this letter, your appointment shall
be for an initial term of three years commencing on 24 May 2018 until
the Board meeting occurring approximately three years from that date
unless terminated earlier by either party giving to the other six months’
prior written notice. Following the initial term, the term may be extended
by a further period of three years in accordance with paragraph 1.4
below, subject to the Board being satisfied that it is appropriate to make
such an offer.

POL00411972

Your appointment is subject to the Company's articles of association, as
amended from time to time (Articles). Nothing in this letter shall be
taken to exclude or vary the terms of the Articles as they apply to you as
a director of the Company. Your appointment is subject to the prior
written consent of the Special Shareholder (as defined within the
Articles), which has been obtained.

Continuation of your appointment is contingent on your continued
satisfactory performance and any relevant statutory provisions relating
to removal of a director. If you are retired from office under the Articles,
your appointment shall terminate automatically, with immediate effect
and without compensation.

A NED is typically expected to serve two three year terms. Any term
renewal is subject to Board review. Notwithstanding any mutual
expectation, there is no right to re-nomination by the Board, either
annually or after any three year period.

You may be required to serve on one or more Board committees. You will
be provided with the relevant terms of reference on your appointment to
such a committee.

Notwithstanding paragraph 1.1 to paragraph 1.4, the Company may
terminate your appointment with immediate effect if you have:

(a) committed a material breach of your obligations under this letter;

(b) committed any serious or repeated breach or non-observance of
your obligations to the Company (which include an obligation not to
breach your statutory, fiduciary or common-law duties);

(c) been guilty of any fraud or dishonesty or acted in any manner which,
in the Company's opinion, brings or is likely to bring you or the
Company into disrepute or is materially adverse to the Company's
interests;

(d) been convicted of an arrestable criminal offence other than a road
traffic offence for which a fine or non-custodial penalty is imposed;

(e) been declared bankrupt or have made an arrangement with or for
the benefit of your creditors, or if you have a county court
administration order made against you under the County Courts Act
1984;

(f) been disqualified from acting as a director;

(g) not complied with the Company’s anti-corruption and bribery policy
and procedures or the Bribery Act 2010.

POL00411972

On termination of your appointment, you shall, at the Company’s
request, resign from your office as NED of the Company.

If matters arise which cause you concern about your role, you should
discuss these matters with the chairman or chief executive. If you have
any concerns which cannot be resolved, and you choose to resign for
that, or any other, reason, you should provide an appropriate written
statement to the chief executive or the senior independent director for
circulation to the Board.

TIME COMMITMENT

You will be expected to devote such time as is necessary for the proper
performance of your duties as a director. Overall we anticipate that you
will spend a minimum of 2 days a month on work for the Company after
the induction phase referred to in paragraph 8. This will include
attendance at eight scheduled Board meetings per year, one annual
Board away day event a year (which may span over two days), at least
one site visit a year, Board dinners, meetings forming part of the Board
evaluation process and training meetings. In addition, you will be
required to consider all relevant papers before each meeting. Unless
urgent and unavoidable circumstances prevent you from doing so, it is
expected that you will attend such of the meetings outlined in this
paragraph as may be required.

The nature of the role makes it impossible to be specific about the
maximum time commitment. You may be required to devote additional
time to the Company in respect of preparation time and ad hoc matters
which may arise and particularly when the Company is undergoing a
period of increased activity. At certain times it may be necessary to
convene additional Board or committee meetings.

The overall time commitment stated in paragraph 2.1 will increase if you
become a committee member. Details of the expected increase in time
commitment will be covered in any relevant communication confirming
the additional responsibility.

By accepting this appointment, you confirm that, taking into account all
of your other commitments, you are able to allocate sufficient time to the
Company to discharge your responsibilities effectively. You should obtain
the agreement of the chairman before accepting additional commitments
that might affect the time you are able to devote to your role as NED of
the Company.

ROLE AND DUTIES

The Board as a whole is collectively responsible for the success of the
Company. The Board's role is to:

relevant obligations under prevailing law and regulation, including the
Companies Act 2006 and the UK Corporate Governance Code and

of the Company under which all directors must act in the way they
consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of
the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole. In doing so, as
a director, you must have regard (among other matters) to:

(a) the likely consequences of any decision in the long term;
(b) the interests of the Company's employees;

(c) the need to foster the Company's business relationships with
suppliers, customers and others;

(d) the impact of the Company's operations on the community and the
environment;

(0) not do anything that would cause you to be disqualified from acting

You shall be entitled to request all relevant information about the
Company's affairs as is reasonably necessary to enable you to discharge
your duties.

FEES AND EXPENSES

You shall be paid an annual fee of £35,000 gross (current at the date of
this letter), which shall be paid in equal instalments monthly in arrears
through PAYE after deduction of any taxes and other amounts that are
required by law, which shall be subject to a periodic review by the Board.
This fee covers all duties, including service on any Board committee
(current at the date of this letter).

The Company shall reimburse you for all reasonable and properly
documented expenses that you incur in performing the duties of your
office. The procedure and other guidance in respect of expense claims is

On termination of your appointment, you shall only be entitled to such
fees as may have accrued to the date of termination, together with
reimbursement in the normal way of any expenses properly incurred
before that date.

INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL ADVICE

In some circumstances you may consider that you need professional
advice in the furtherance of your duties as a director and it may be
appropriate for you to seek advice from independent advisers at the
Company’s expense. A copy of the Board’s agreed procedure under which
directors may obtain such independent advice is available from the
company secretary. The Company shall reimburse the reasonable cost of
expenditure incurred by you in accordance with its policy.

OUTSIDE INTERESTS

You have already disclosed to the Board the commitments you have
outside your role in the Company. You must inform the chief executive in
advance of any changes to these commitments. In certain circumstances,
you may have to seek the Board's agreement before accepting further
commitments which either might give rise to a conflict of interest or a
conflict with any of your duties to the Company, or which might impact
on the time that you are able to devote to your role at the Company.

It is accepted and acknowledged that you have business interests other
than those of the Company and have declared any conflicts that are
apparent at present. If you become aware of any further potential or
actual conflicts of interest, these should be disclosed to the chairman and
company secretary as soon as you become aware of them and again you
may have to seek the agreement of the Board.

The Board has determined that you are independent according to the
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.

CONFIDENTIALITY

You acknowledge that all information acquired during your appointment
is confidential to the Company and should not be released, communicated
or disclosed to third parties or used for any reason other than in the
interests of the Company, either during your appointment or following
termination (by whatever means), without prior clearance from the chief
executive. This restriction shall cease to apply to any confidential
information which may (other than by reason of your breach) become
available to the public generally.

You acknowledge the need to hold and retain Company information (in
whatever format you may receive it) under appropriately secure
conditions.

Nothing in this paragraph 7 shall prevent you from disclosing information
which you are entitled to disclose under the Public Interest Disclosure Act
1998, provided that the disclosure is made in accordance with the
provisions of that Act and you have complied with the Company's policy
from time to time in force regarding such disclosures.

INDUCTION

After the commencement of your appointment, the Company will provide
a comprehensive, formal and tailored induction. We will arrange for site

during your first year of appointment (in addition to the time commitment
outlined paragraph 2.1) for the purposes of the induction. The company
secretary will contact you with further details.

TRAINING

On an on-going basis, and further to the annual evaluation process, the
Company will arrange for you to develop and refresh your skills and
knowledge in areas which are mutually identified as being likely to be
required, or of benefit to you, in carrying out your duties effectively. You
should try to make yourself available for any relevant training sessions
which may be organised for the Board.

REVIEW PROCESS

The performance of individual directors and the whole Board and its
committees is evaluated annually. If, in the interim, there are any
matters which cause you concern about your role you should discuss
them with the chairman as soon as you can.

The Company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and it intends
to maintain such cover for the full term of your appointment. The
indemnity limit is £60m (current at the date of this letter). A copy of the
policy document is available from the company secretary.

CHANGES TO PERSONAL DETAILS

address or other personal contact details.

RETURN OF PROPERTY

or at any time at the Board's request, you shall immediately return to the

the Company which may be in your possession or under your control, and
which relate in any way to the Company's business affairs and you shall
