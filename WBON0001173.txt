All

Thanks to all those who have commented so far. We're locking down the Defence at 9am on Monday so that we can
complete all the cross referencing and proof reading before the Tuesday deadline. If you have any final comments,
please let us know before then.

Thanks

All

Please find attached the draft Defence for your review and comment. As discussed earlier, if possible please provide
comments rather than amendments to the actual text. I've also attached the Claimants' Generic Particulars of Claim
for reference.

You'll see a few points where input from Deloitte and Fujitsu is needed — we expect to get this today.

Please send any comments to me and Amy Prime (copied).

Thanks
Andy
