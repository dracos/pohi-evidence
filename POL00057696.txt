I have been employed by Post Office Ltd for ?? years. My current role is Network Field

Support Advisor which I have held since September 2010 and my duties include
auditing Post Office branches. The purpose of this role is to verify the assets held at a
Post Office branch are correct and the transactions are performed to the required
specification to ensure the security of the Post Office, its customers and its clients and
report the result of the audit.

On Wednesday 8" February 2011 I arrived at Birkenshaw Post Office branch 712
Bradford Road Birkenshaw Bradford BD11 2AE at approximately 08:55 am to undertake
an Intervention visit on behalf of cash management and complete a cash check.

I introduced myself to the sub postmaster Mr Khayyam ISHAQ and explained the
purpose of my visit to the branch. Mr Ishaq allowed me access to the secure area.

I counted the cash and discovered the cash was short by £536. I asked Mr Ishaq if this
is what he was expecting and he replied that it was different to the cash he had
declared the previous night.

I reported my findings to the Paul WilILLIAMS Contract Manger for Post Office Ltd and

also explained that there was a discrepancy surplus in the balance snapshot of £2100.
Mr WILLIAMS requested a full audit of all the cash and stock held at the Post Office
branch. All the, cash, stock and vouchers held at Birkenshaw Post Office branch were
to be checked and I explained this to Mr ISHAQ.

At approximately 11:40 am my collage Kath SMITH arrived at the branch to assist me
with the audit.

I printed off a series of reports from the Horizon system to ascertain the cash and stock
holdings that should be on hand at Birkenshaw Post Office branch in order to complete
the audit.

I completed the audit and the result of the audit was a shortage of £21,168.64 on the

day. A breakdown of the audit result and details of the audit findings are as follows:

Identified as a shortage in stock figures £ 12.90
Identified as a discrepancy as per office snapshot -£ 21,181.54
Total Shortage -£ 21,168.64

There were large discrepancies in the stock of 100 x 1 class stamps sheets, 100x
second class stamp sheets, 50 x first class stamp sheets and 50 x second class stamp
sheets.

I have produced a report detailing the findings at Birkenshaw Post Office branch and I

now produce this report as DW/1.

Continuation of statement of David WATSON

I asked Mr ISHAQ if he had an explanation of these discrepancies and he replied that
he had no idea.

My colleague Kath SMITH contacted Chesterfield to check if the stamps received at
Birkenshaw had been incorrectly accounted for. It was reported back that a number of
sales for large sheet of stamps had been reversed out of the Horizon system.

I asked Mr ISHAQ if he had an explanation for these sales reversals and he replied that
he had no knowledge of any sales being reversed and a relief sub postmaster had
been working at the branch and it could have been him.

I informed Mr ISHAQ that the majority of the reversals had taken place under his own
User ID and he replied that the relief had been using Mr ISHAQ’s User ID.

I offered Mr Ishaq the opportunity to satisfy himself that the figures of the audit team
were correct and perform his own independent count of the cash and stock on hand, he
declined this offer.

The reports printed off the Horizon system together with Branch Trading Statements

have been passed to Stephen BRADSHAW Security Manager.
