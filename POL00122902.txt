All,

The day (hopefully) will give us the opportunity to go through the documents, up skill around interview technique and
have discussion over any ambiguity or areas of concern you may have in a workshop session. It is vital that you spend
sometime going through the conduct of investigation policy and importantly actively participate on what will be an
interesting, informative and enjoyable day.

Regards

Rob
