1am the person named above and I live at the address overleaf. I work for Post Office Ltd and my current role is
as Field Support Officer. As part of my role I undertake audits at Post Office® Branches.

On the 3rd September 2010, accompanied by my colleague Richard Cross, ! conducted an audit of the above
named branch. The audit had been arranged as Tracey Bedford, Migration Support Officer, had found the cash
to be short by £13624.41 the previous day and had therefore closed the office pending our visit.

The purpose of this audit was therefore to verify financial assets due to the Post Office®.

The audit revealed a shortage in the branch of £14842.37. A breakdown of the audit result and details of the

audit findings are as follows:

€ 13577.34 (-) Identified as a difference in cash figures

£ 446.03 (-) Identified as a difference in stock figures

€ 14023.37 (-) Total shortage on day of audit

£ Pending transaction correction, advised by Product & Branch Accounting on
819.00 (-) the day of the audit

£ _14842.37 (-) Total shortage

We arrived at the branch at 13.00 pm and introduced ourselves to the Postmaster Miss Alison Hall and advised
that we were to perform an audit on behalf of Post Office Ltd.

Miss Hall allowed us access to the secure area, and was present in the secure area whilst the audit was carried
out.

Miss Hall said the loss had occurred due to Lottery accounting problems and produced a report from Lottery

Accounting Chesterfield detailing errors ( mainly activations on the Lottery terminal not all being remitted in on

Continuation Statement of Mr Jeff Roper
the Horizon system ) going back 18 months. She had been accepting the Transaction Corrections, adjusting the
instants on hand back down to the correct figure but not putting any money in to compensate. The Trading
Statement copies printed (originals unreadable) all show a clear balance and Miss Hall stated these were
adjusted to show clear before rolling over. Cash declarations together with snapshots produced indicate ONCH
falsely declared for some considerable time.
A call to Chesterfield revealed further Transaction Corrections due for -£819.00 mainly for Instants not remitted
in. Three of these were found with no remittance advice attached to prove to Miss Hail the information supplied
was correct.
The audit was completed revealing numerous discrepancies to stock and stamps on the Horizon snapshot in
addition to the cash discrepancy. The audit loss on the day was £14,842.37 which together with the amount of
£819.00 for Transaction Corrections pending brings the Trading Position deficit to £14,842.37.
Miss Hall was then advised that she should satisfy herself that the figures of the audit team were correct.
Therefore, we asked Miss Hall if she would do her own independent count of all the cash on hand again. She
said she had watched me count the cash and was happy the figure was correct.
Miss Hall then confirmed that the figures of the audit team were correct.
