Belinda: In regard to M052, we have made a further and significant change to
that Final Report and that change was made AFTER I had spoken to you. We are
now recommending this case for Mediation, even though the Applicant had pleaded
guilty to a THEFT charge and, she asserts, concocted a story as to WHY she had
stolen the money. We have made this change because we have come to the
conclusion that there exists a strong possibility that the Applicant is NOW telling
the truth and that her change to a guilty plea, and subsequent plea in mitigation,
were driven purely by her fear of imprisonment (based on the threatened 34
counts of theft) and that, if she was NOT the person who perpetrated the
Pensions and Allowances thefts, then the question is: who did do that and, indeed
whether the reintroductions really were fraudulent? Also, the evidence was
untested (i.e. not presented) in court and such evidence as we examined was,
frankly, inconclusive. The 23rd September email from her PA (Steve Darlington),

POL-0072242
POL00075679
POL00075679

which is uploaded to the case sub-folder in Huddle, asserts that the mitigation
story is disproved by the medical records now submitted. Taking all this into
careful consideration, we have decided to recommend this case for mediation. In
any event, the WG will doubtless vote on whether it goes forward, since we
assume Post Office will vote against it.

Best regards, Ron.

Belinda,
This is just to confirm that since last week's meeting the following Draft and Final CRRs have been uploaded to Huddle:
DRAFT
M065
FINAL
Mooi
M003
M029
M035
Mos2 *
Mo62 **

* I believe that Ron has alerted you to this, which is referred to as Version 2A.
Given additional input received from the Applicant's PA the Mediation recommendation has been changed
from that in the Draft CRR.

** This is the revised version, produced following the request at last week's face to face meeting and is referred to
as V2.
This answers one of the concerns that you raised with me yesterday.

I understand that by the end of this week (26 September) the following Draft CRRs should also have been completed and
uploaded:

Moos

M007

M011

M013

M073

May I suggest that you leave M039 as is but mark that it may be revisited once the Part Two Report has been finalised?
I will respond to Lucy in more detail on the scheduling of all cases.

Regards

Chris Holyoak
