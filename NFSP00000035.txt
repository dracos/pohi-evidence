Dear Executive Officer, Kenn Daves
COUNTER AUTOMATION - INITIAL GO-LIVE Pan Nee

I am sure you will be interested in the attached correspondence which is information
regarding the progress of automation from the original ten offices previously advised to
you to the next phase of a live trial

The correspondence consists of a list of the offices destined to be part of the live trial
starting in March 1997, which consists of offices in the North East and in the South
West. The South West list includes the initial “go-live” offices. Also contained in the
correspondence is a draft letter to Sub-Postmasters which will be sent to those offices
involved.

You will have noted that the launch of the system at Leonard Stanley Post Office has
passed off without any publicity at all. I can advise that the first card payment of Child
Benefit was paid on time without a hitch and the system is now up and running at that
office.

lt is planned to launch the system publicly when the remainder of the ten go live later in
October. This will clearly help us with our publicity as the first offi
member. Whilst we had asked BA/POCL to hold off their publicity until

as involved in the trial, the lack of a public announcement wa:

‘next edition o
In addition to this information you may wish to know that Andrew Stott of the BA/POCL
team has been recalled to the DSS to work on a new fraud initiative. We have,
therefore, lost a good contact within the team and will use our opportunities to build up
a relationship with his successor, Mr. Peter Crahn, who has been brought in from the
DSS.

Also enclosed is a copy of the sign-off form which will be used during the initial go-live
trial. Further information will be provided regarding any changes which the trial
indicates are necessary.

We will keep you advised of developments.

Mawucéinearah........

Bringing Technology to Post Offices and Benefit Payments

Automation Plans for your Post Office

As I hope you are aware, it is one of Post Office Counters top objectives to install
automation into Post Offices. You may also be aware that the installation will start
this Autumn with ten Post Offices in the Stroud area and then take approximately two
years to roll out into every Post Office.

Tam delighted to tell you that your Post Office is to be automated in the next phase of
the installation which will start in March 1997, You will be provided with a computer
system, printer and an additional telephone line to enable you to carry out automated
benefit transactions for Child Benefit customers when they receive the new Payment
Card.

However, you do not need to worry about these details just yet as you will shortly be
provided with more information about plans for your office including training and on-
going support you and your staff will receive.

The automation of Post Offices is a very large and complex project and as one of the
first subpostmaster involved we will be asking for your feedback on the installation
process and the training and support you receive so we can improve how things are
done in the future. You are at the forefront of the most significant and exciting
development in Post Office Counters for many years - perhaps the most important
ever. I hope you will enjoy taking part and I look forward to your contribution.

At this stage please do not hesitate to raise any questions or concerns you have about
automation with your retail network manager who should be in contact soon to
confirm some details about your Post Office and begin to gather your ideas on how the
installation can be most effectively handled.
