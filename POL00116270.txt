Hi Paula - here's David's note - it's just an outline at this stage and needs some more work, I'll input over the
weekend.

Belinda is going to speak to SS on Monday to set up your meeting with them, liaising with Theresa over your
availability (I'll speak to T to let her know which meetings this takes priority over).

We were also planning to set up the call or meeting with TH before the Board - again can just be a fact
finding/temperature check conversation if necessary.

Thanks,
Martin

Please see attached. This is a bit rough for today but codifies the three key options I could come up
with.

Will think on this over the weekend and refine a bit.
