Subject: [OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE:COMMERCIAL] Submission on Post Office Horizon mediation scheme

Claire

As discussed (and with thanks for the extension to the box deadline) please see attached submission for Jo Swinson on
the Post Office mediation scheme. I’d be grateful if this can go in the Minister’s box today flagged for her urgent
attention —in particular, we would welcome her early steer on whether she agrees with the decision not to table a WMS.
for the day of this announcement.

Hannah in Comms has agreed our recommendation of a reactive, BIS-spokesperson line only.
Georgie — I'll be in touch separately about the WMS point.

Thanks

Laura
