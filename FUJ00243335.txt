Hi Mike,

I hope you are well.

Just touching base to see how you are progressing with getting the draft scoping document ready for our
review?

Keen to see this before our workshop next Tuesday if possible.

Cheers,
Ervin

Ervin,

A revised document is currently doing the rounds and am hoping this will be signed off early next week
post which I will issues a copy.

In terms of meeting, I have checked the calendars of the various stakeholders and have broad availability
for the following dates/times:

11th Nov 14:00+
15th Nov 09:00-15:00
16th Nov 13:00+
17th Nov 09:00-10:30

Ideally, we would need to meet in our Baker Street offices, but may be able to flex this on certain dates
if this does not work for you.

Let me know if any of these suit you so we can book diaries out.

Hi, Ervin,

I am now in receipt of a draft document describing the measures built into Horizon On-Line to ensure
integrity.

There are a few obvious changes that need to be made and I then need to ensure that this has been
received the mandatory and legal reviews before issuing this to you. I hope for this to be available in
the next few days.

I believe that the recommended next step is for round table session that would help you to propose a
scoping document. I would suggest we aim to get this in the diary when we have issued you with the
aforementioned document.

Ervin

Apologies I have been slow in coming back to you.

By way of this email I would like to introduce Mike Deaton, who is going to lead this initiative on
behalf of the Fujitsu Post Office Account and ensure it has the focus it needs.

I have seen a draft of the document which outlines the behaviour of the platform which is being reviewed
and Mike will forward to you shortly.

It is probably worth having a call with Mike to confirm the doc will meet your expectations and then the
workshop can be set up.

Please use Mike as your first point of contact, and just copy me in as needed.
Kind Regards and apologies once again

Gavin

I know we tried to connect last week. Just checking to see how things are progressing on your end with
getting a scoping document for us to review and respond to.

Also when did you want to have the follow-up meeting so I can pencil some dates in so we’re best
prepared.

My best,
Ervin
