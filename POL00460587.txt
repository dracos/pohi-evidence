Document preservation

‘+ On 18 October 2021, POL implemented a document hold in relation to the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry in order to comply with POL's
obligations as a Core Participant in the Inquiry, which includes the disclosure of relevant documents.

‘+ The document hold? informed all POL staff and contractors (including third party contractors) that all documnents must be preserved (ie.
not destroyed) that may ultimately need to be disclosed to the Inquiry,

‘+ "Document is defined very widely and includes not only hard copy documents and correspondence, but any media on which
information of any description is stored.

‘+The range of documents that could be relevant is very broad ~ the document hold captures anything that relates to the Inquiry’s Terms
of Reference or Completed List of Issues which would include by non-exhaustive way of example, documents that relate to liaison with
Fujitsu, policies in respect of Horizon, governance documents, audit and investigation documents.

‘+ Failure to preserve relevant documents could result in severe sanctions against POL.

‘+ Where there are queries about whether material can be destroyed, these should be directed to the Inquiry legal team for advice.

* The document hold can be found on SharePoint Document Preservation - a message from Ben Foat (sharepoint,com)
