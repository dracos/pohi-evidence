Paul,
I think you may have misinterpreted my e-mail,,,,, I have not said that no faults were logged. What I am saying is that if you want

me to I can extract the calls logged so that I can examine them to see if there are any fault calls during these dates.

No need for anything beyond this Andy. I have explained to the Police that all you can say is that no faults were logged
and they are happy with that.

Paul,

I am unable to say for definite that the Horizon system was working ok. What I can do is look at all calls logged by this
PO during the date range and state that there were no faults reported by the PO to suggest any faults.

If you want me to get the calls extracted to examine the calls we will need ARQ numbers to cover this request.
Please let me know what you would like us to do...

Maureen,

This is the stuff I wanted from Andy Dunks.

There has not been an ARQ in respect of this. All the Police wanted was a statement to say that the Horizon appeared
to be working OK at the branch in the run up to the audit shortage. If he can’t do it then I will have to tell the Police as

such.

Give us a ring if you need anything else.

thanks

Right so shall I go for 6 months initially — it will come off our allocation even if we are not getting the transactional data
so I am loath to go for 12 as that’s a big chunk

Jane,

At present the Police haven't asked for Horizon records although I am sure that if they know we can provide them they
will ask for them (and then not use them). Alll the officer asked was if we could provide a statement saying that the
Horizon system was operating correctly in the run up to the shortage being identified.

The branch is St Johns Green, Branch code: - 373340

The period of time would be a reasonable period before the branch was audited on 17" November 2010.

Thanks again

Hi Jane

Yes. Suggest you identify the timeframe when the funds were reported as missing and ask us to provide Helpdesk
Call analysis.

Has Paul already received transaction records / does he need them? If he has them quote the ARQ reference
numbers and get the statement to cover that timeframe. If he hasn't does he need them to accompany the witness
statement?

Kind regards
Penny

Subject: Request for a Statement from Andy Dunks.

Jane,

I currently have a Police liaison inquiry centred on St John Green Subpostoffice Rotherham.

Briefly the office was audited and found to be approx 11k short and a clerk is suspected and has been interviewed.
The case has been reviewed and the Police officer has asked me to get a statement demonstrating the robustness of

the horizon system at the branch.

The case is unusual as the branch is operated by a charity (YMCA) and because of this we were asked to get involved
at the outset in order to possibly mitigate the adverse publicity of us demanding our money back from them.

Would it be possible to get a statement from Andy Dunks to assist and give a statement please?
Give me a bell if you need to.

PS How’s your essay? Have you finished it?
