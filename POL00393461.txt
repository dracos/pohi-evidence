Thanks, Tom

I will check with Julie and ask about timescales. I had thought that the points you raise would tie in with what Julie
said about presenting a paper on KELs to the Group Executive and then including standing metrics in the Post GLO
Implementation Plan Report to the Board but I don’t think the timeline for that was mentioned so I will check and find
out what the metrics would cover.

Best wishes
Veronica

I think a number of us are very keen to understand how issues with Horizon (such as the presence of some
bugs currently) and related process issues (eg around outstanding dispute and time to resolution) are going to
be reported so that we can get comfort that issues are being resolved in a timely way. I don’t remember the
conversation exactly but I think there’s an action for Julie and the team to come back to us on this isn’t there?
