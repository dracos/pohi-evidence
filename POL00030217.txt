Dear Sarah

Internal control matters arising from the 2011 audit

1 am pleased to present our management letter for the year ended 27 March 2011.

Our review of the company’s systems of internal control is carried out to help us
express an opinion on the accounts of the company as a whole. This work is not
primarily directed towards the discovery of weaknesses, the detection of fraud or
other irregularities (other than those which would influence us in forming that
opinion) and should not, therefore, be relied upon to show that no other weaknesses
exist or areas require attention. Accordingly, the comments in this letter refer only to
those matters that have come to our attention during the course of our normal audit
work and do not attempt to indicate all possible improvements that a special review
might develop. We would be happy to discuss any of the points contained within this
letter in more detail with you.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank management for their input into the
management letter process and to thank you and your staff for assistance during the
course of our audit.

Yours sincerely

Angus Grant
Partner, on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP

The contents of this report are subject to the terms and conditions of our appointment as set out in our
engagement letter.

This report is made solely to the Board of Directors and management of Post Office Limited in
accordance with the terms of our engagement letter. Our work has been undertaken so that we might
report to the Board of Directors and management of Post Office Limited those matters that we are
required to and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Board of Directors and management of Post Office Limited for
this report or for the opinions we have formed. It should not be provided to any third party without our
prior written consent.

Executive summary

The finance leadership team at Post Office Limited (POL) has implemented
and process improvements throughout the organisation during the past financial
year.

In particular, focussed management action has addressed many of the issues
raised in our prior year management letter and led to significant improvement in the
overall payroll control environment. The recommendations we have made in this
report should be seen as refinements rather than fundamental control deficiencies in
comparison.

The main area we would encourage management focus on in the current
year is improving the IT governance and control environment.

Within the IT environment our audit work has again identified weaknesses
mainly relating to the control environment operated by POL'’s third party IT suppliers.
Our key recommendations can be summarised into the following four areas:

Improve governance of outsourcing application management
Improve segregation of duties within the manage change process

Strengthen the change management process
Strengthen the review of privileged access

VV V Vv

We also encourage management to continue to enhance the Legal & Compliance
review framework to manage risks in relation to regulatory compliance associated
with financial services activities.

Liability
(Poss)

POL
-Chesterfi

The liability for Post
Office Savings Stamps is
£25.6m. A further £11.6m
(£9.5m 2009) liability for losses
has been recognised due to
stamp redemption losses
(predominantly fraud).

The liability for
redemption losses is highly
judgmental and has been
calculated by updating the prior
year liability for an estimate of
losses incurred in the current
year from the results of sample
checks of pouches received.
Approximately 50% of returned
pouches are checked.

The product is due to be
curtailed during 2010/11 and as
a result it is expected that the
majority of the liability will be run
down by year end 2011.

» Based on the level of losses
estimated in the year (£2.1m),
we recommend that a higher
proportion of returned pouches
are checked while the product
is run off.

» At year end 2011 the
remaining liability should be
calculated on a whole portfolio
basis rather than as an
adjustment to the brought
forward liability as this will
improve the accuracy of the
remaining unknown liability

We accept the recommendation and
had already explained during the
course of the audit that we would
increase our coverage during the
period of the withdrawal of savings
stamps. The % of pouches checked
has increased from 25% at the
beginning of 2009/10 to 50% now,
with focus continuing to be on those
pouches which we expect to be most
at risk of errors.

The Savings Stamps product has.
been withdrawn on 25th May but will
continue to be accepted as a method
of payment in Post Office branches
until 28th August, 2010. The current
value and volume of redemptions
has increased by 10% and 14%
respectively, but we are anticipating
that by August the redemptions will
drop off significantly. We anticipate
that we will start to reduce the work
in this area during August and the
value and volume of redemptions will
drop off further after this date. We
will closely monitor the redemption
profiles and arrange the checking
work in line with these.

The support for the
calculation provided in the
current year addressed the
recommendation from prior
year. The calculation factored
in the basis of estimation and
showed both the higher and
lower end of the range of
potential outcomes. As
anticipated, the withdrawal of
this product has made the
tracking of the liability and
forecasting of redemptions
easier to manage and review.

Payroll management's process
requires that all employee
change requests that lead to
new contracts should be
reviewed. A checklist for
individual change requests is
completed and signed off and
these are tracked on an overall

log for all change request:

Based on our review of the log
we identified that;

We repeat our recommendation
from prior year that the log is
maintained and updated accurately.
This will give an oversight as to the
effectiveness of the control. The log
should clearly identify those
changes that require a new
contract.

37.

The data capture spreadsheet has
been re-aligned and now
encompasses all of the
recommendations. In addition we
have made further enhancements to
the data capture spreadsheet eg.
introduced new numbering system to
identify when the change was
processed, split out processing
months by unique tab, have a clear
indication of 10% checks for each
tab, added a further column to
identify incorrect source information
and also added a short facing sheet
for every change which will sit with
personal papers.

All of the above has been in place
since Period 1.

We noted during our review
that it is now possible to see
where the log has been
updated for changes
between contractual to non-
contractual changes,
however this is not always
clear when reviewing, and as
such have raised this as a
current year point. For our
sample selected in the
current year, we noted that
where the change was

We also noted that in one

Whilst there have been some
limited improvements in the
control environment during the
current financial year, we were
again unable to rely ona
number of key payroll controls to
reduce our substantive work for
the year-end audit.

Further, during the course of our
work we identified areas where
controls were not operating as
payroll management believed
them to operate and where
actions included in
management's responses to our
management letter last year had
not been taken or were
ineffective in addressing the
deficiency identified. We believe
this indicates a weakness in the
overall control monitoring
process.

Weaknesses in the control
environment may lead to errors
in financial reporting or actual
losses to the business.

We recommend a stronger focus
on the payroll control environment
in terms of senior management
oversight, including obtaining a
better understanding of the
operating effectiveness of the
existing controls, encouraging a
stronger control culture and more
intensive control monitoring going
forward.

In overall terms it is agreed that there
needs to be a greater profile around
the whole area of controls. A number
of actions have now been agreed by
the management team and are in
place for Period 1 including random
independent checks and KPIs on the
local scorecard and on the overall
HR scorecard.

When users have the rights to
change reports that are used by
the business for reconciliation,
exception reporting or other
processing, there is the risk that
the reports are manipulated
either intentionally or
accidentally.

Changes to Credence should be
requested, tested and approved by
the business users. Changes
should be identifiable through
system logs and an appropriate
audit trail maintained of request,

such changes should be limited to

During our testing of the 1 60
appropriateness of users with
access to the Horizon back end
environment we noted one user
whose access was no longer
required due to a change in job
responsibilities.

When users have access to
environments which are ni
appropriate for their job function
there is the risk that users may
inappropriately or accidentally
use the access leading to loss of
application or data integrity.

Post Office management should
request periodic evidence from
Fujitsu that demonstrates that the
user population with access to the
Horizon environment has been
reviewed and access validated.
Additionally, Post Office should
consider requesting Fujitsu to
establish controls relating to
temporary access.

A note has been sent to Fujitsu on
their responsibilities in this area.

Although the note has been sent to
Fujitsu, it is likely this will be covered
in their up-coming 1SO27001 audit
and compliance work. This is going
to be an agenda item on the monthly
ISMS and considered for inclusion in
monthly reporting.

Whilst Horizon has been
upgraded to HNGX during
the audit period, this issue is
still relevant for the HNGX
