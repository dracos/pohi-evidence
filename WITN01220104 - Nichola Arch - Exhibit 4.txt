Dear Siobhan,

Thank you for your email dated 9 November, enclosing correspondence from your constituent,
Ms Nichola Arch
compensation for postmasters.

lunderstand the serious impact that issues arising from faults with the Horizon IT system, and
the Post Office’s management of these issues, have had on affected postmasters’ lives and
livelihoods, and | was very sorry to read Ms Arch explain the impact that this has had on her life.
The Government recognises the distress that postmasters and their families have suffered since
faults with the Horizon system began, with some, such as Ms Arch, having their livelihoods and
businesses taken away and some convicted of crimes which we now know they did not commit.
The Post Office has accepted that it got things wrong and has apologised. However,
Government has been clear that this apology must only be the start of a process that leads to
real and fundamental change in the Post Office.

| recognise that Ms Arch was part of the Group Litigation Order (GLO) against Post Office
Limited. In December 2019, Post Office Limited and claimants in the GLO reached a substantive
settlement of £57.75m. Post Office Limited also issued an apology and this concluded the civil
case against the company. | understand the strength of feeling by postmasters who only
received a portion of the £57.75m settlement paid by Post Office. However, a full and final
settlement was reached between the claimants in the GLO and the Post Office.

Thank you again for taking the time to write in. | appreciate that this may not be the response
Ms Arch was hoping for, but | hope it explains the Government's position and is helpful to you.

Yours ever,

GRO

PAUL SCULLY MP
Minister for Small Business, Consumers & Labour Markets
and Minister for London
