Ir} Response =

following a significant amount of monitoring we have been unable to
Kefinitively link any equipment /environmental issues to any particular event.
[there have been incidents which showed a possible correlation between system
lctivity and phanton Txns, these pointed to a touch screen problem and as a
result the screen was replaced with a Resitive model. As this produced no
measurable improvement it has to be assumed that the problems were user
related.
