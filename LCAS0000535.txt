POST OFFICE LIMITED
Claimant
and
MR LEE CASTLETON
Defendant
STATEMENT OF CLAIM
1. From about the 18 July 2003 and 23 March 2004, the Defendant held the office of subpostmaster

and in that capacity acted as the Claimant's agent in the conduct of his business, in the premises
known as Marine Drive Branch, 14 South Marine Drive, Bridlington, YO15 3DB.

2. The Defendant held that office under a contract for services in the terms of the Claimant's
standard subpostmasters contract.

3. The express terms of his contract for services included those contained in the standard
subpostmasters contract together with the terms contained in the documents referred to in a
written Acknowledgement of Appointment, namely:-

(a) the personal declaration signed by the Defendant

(b) the rules in the Claimant's Book of Rules

(c) the instructions contained in the Postal Instructions issued from time to time to the
Defendant.

4, In particular, the contract contained express terms that:-

(a) the Defendant was strictly responsible for the safe custody of cash, stock of all kinds and
other property of the Claimant, whether held by himself or by his assistants and was
obliged to keep them in a place of security (see section 12, paragraph 5 of the standard
subpostmasters contract)

(b) the Defendant was responsible for maintaining a standard of security sufficient to enable

him to meet such obligations for the safekeeping of the Claimant's cash and stock placed
in his care (see section 12, paragraph 6 of the standard subpostmasters contract)

LC0175.0003

LCAS0000535

(c) the Defendant was responsible for, and obliged to make good without delay, all losses

caused through his own negligence, carelessness or error, and also losses of any kind

caused by his assistants (see section 12, paragraph 12 and section 15, paragraph 2 of

the standard subpostmasters contract)

(d) the Defendant's financial responsibility (for example, to make good losses) did not cease

when he relinquished his appointment and he remains obliged to make good any losses
incurred during his term of office which subsequently came to light (see section 12,
paragraph 13 of the standard subpostmasters contract).

Pursuant to his contract and his position as the Claimant's agent, the Defendant whether by

himself or his employees or agents, dealt with financial transactions between the Claimant and its

customers and was obliged to keep true and accurate records of all such transactions and to

account to the Claimant for all monies the subject of such transactions and to deliver up to the

Claimant the proper balance from time to time resulting from such transactions.

Between about the 18 July 2003 and 25 March 2004 net losses amounting to the sum of
£27115.83 occurred at the said sub post office. The said net figure is made up of the following

individual items:-

assistants.

Pursuant to the terms set out in Paragraph 3 and/or the duty set out in Paragraph 4 above, the

Defendant is liable to pay to the Claimant the sum of £27115.83 which remains due and owing.
