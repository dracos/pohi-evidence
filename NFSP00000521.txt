Inland Revenue Cashcheques

The National President reported that Subpostmasters would
be reimbursed for the fraudulent Inland Revenue
Cashcheques that they submitted to the Federation. A
cheque will be sent from Post Office Limited to the
Federation for £32,000. The maximum payment to an
individual Subpostmaster would be £2,000. Every
Subpostmaster that receives a payment will have to sign a
non-disclosure agreement.

The Negotiating Committee continue to argue the issue of
reimbursement for $100 counterfeit bureau.

Rod Ismay, Post Office Limited will be sending out a crib
sheet to Subpostmasters explaining the process of disputing
and appealing against transaction corrections that are
received on the day before or the day of roll-over.

Mr David Milner offered his appreciation and support to the
National President on behalf of the Executive Council.
