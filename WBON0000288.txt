Jonny

This is looking really good. A few comments from me attached.

Given that Tony has to read Robert's report and AVDB, I think we send this to Steve, get him to fill in the blanks and
then send to Counsel.

Please find attached Steve's draft statement. I've rejigged it quite a bit in light of Counsels' comments and I've
updated it to reflect the analysis carried out by Steve and John (first two attachments).

Are you able to look at this today or shall I send it straight to Counsel?

Thanks
