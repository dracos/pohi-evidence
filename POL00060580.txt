As discussed I need some help in getting a witness statement from Martin Rolfe. When you have identified
someone who can help me, have them give me a call and I'll set up the meeting with Martin.

Thanks, Simon

Well... my pressure on Rudkin has paid off. He eventually found the attached doc which shows that the
person he met at Bracknell was Martin ROLFE.

POL needs to get Martin's side of the story straight way. Also, please let's find out why he did not
come forward earlier (you told us you'd contacted all the Basement team to ask if they'd met Rudkin,
yes?).

Best regards, Ron.
