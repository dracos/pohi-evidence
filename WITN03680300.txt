POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

THIRD WITNESS STATEMENT OF SIMON GEOFFREY OLDNALL ON BEHALF

OF POST OFFICE LIMITED IN THE POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

I, SIMON GEOFFREY OLDNALL, of 100 Wood Street, London, EC2V 7ER, say as

follows:

Introduction

1. I am the Branch Technology Director at Post Office Limited (“Post Office”). I have
been employed by Post Office since September 2020 in this role. This is my third
witness statement to the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (“the Inquiry.”). I have an
LLB(Hons) degree in Law, an MBA in Business Administration (with an emphasis
on public sector management). I also hold a Master’s Degree in Crime Deviance
and Social Policy. I joined Post Office in September 2020, prior to this I was
employed for 20 years by a number of consultancy and technology companies,

primarily focussed on the delivery of technology enabled change programmes in

Page 1 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

the UK and overseas. Before then, I spent 10 years in the UK civil service working
for the DWP, its predecessors and related agencies.

2. Within my consulting experience I have worked both advising clients on optimal
approaches to IT supply arrangements and supporting operating models as well
as providing IT delivery services to a range of clients in the UK and overseas. I
have also, over the last thirty years, obtained additional professional certifications
in relation to other areas such as coaching and agile project management which
have further developed my skills in relation to IT and technology delivery.

3. In my role as Branch Technology Director, I am responsible for:

a) managing the Post Office Branch Technology team and working with third
party suppliers involved in the Horizon IT system and other related branch
technologies (“Horizon’)'. The team is comprised of various sub-teams
which focus on different aspects of the Horizon IT System (including
Postmaster Experience, Commercial Management, Quality Assurance,
Horizon Live Services, Remediation and Change as well as Security, Risk
& Investigations).

b) Providing senior sponsorship of the delivery of a number of Branch
Technology transformation programmes.

c) Embedding and ensuring changes following the GLO litigation to ensure that
Post Office IT takes steps to ensure issues identified in the Horizon Issues

Judgment (“HIJ”) are sustained in the Post Office IT organisation.

‘These third party suppliers are Fujitsu Services Ltd, DXC, Accenture and Worldline.

Page 2 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

d) supporting the Post Office Group Chief Transformation Officer (“CTrO”) and
forming part of both the Post Office and Post Office Technology Leadership

team.

4. This witness statement has been prepared in response to Questions 47 and 48 of
the 58" request and the 60" request made to Post Office by the Inquiry pursuant
to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006 (“R9(58) and R9(60)”).

5. I have sought to include within this witness statement evidence relating to matters
or issues detailed in the Rule 9 requests insofar as the relevant facts are within my
own knowledge.

6. The facts in this witness statement are true, complete and accurate to the best of
my knowledge and belief.

7. Questions 47 and 48 of R9(58) and Question 4 of R9(60) sought evidence in relation
to some matters and issues that are not within my knowledge. Therefore, as was
the case in my second witness statement, where my knowledge has been informed
by another person or by documents that I have reviewed for the purposes of
preparing this statement, I will specifically acknowledge the identity of the individual

concerned or the nature of the documents.

R9(58)

Steps taken by the Post Office prior to September 2020 in relation to the testing,

monitoring, management, rectification of BEDs and the impact on branch

accounts following the HIJ

8. In paragraph 403 of my second witness statement, I explained that I joined Post

Office in September 2020. I went on to state that;

Page 3 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

“Before this date, I am not aware of any coordinated effort to systematically
implement a series of improvements or changes in relation to the areas covered
in this question.”

9. In Questions 47 and 48 of R9(58), the Inquiry asked Post Office to explain why
changes were only initiated or implemented in relation to the levels of testing,
monitoring, compliance and reporting on bugs, errors and defects (“BEDs”), other
network and system failures or the impact of those events on branch accounts, and
the management, rectification and recording of BEDs in September 2020 and not
in the nine months before that which followed the HIJ.

10. I have spoken with the then Head of IT Service (Retail), who has explained to me
that, in June 2019, he and the then Post Office Business Horizon Owner created a
process for the management of what were then current new open BEDs within the
Horizon system and how Fujitsu was progressing to resolve these. At the time, this
was a Fujitsu led meeting. This included a weekly review with Fujitsu on current
BEDs which were all logged in Microsoft Dynamics which is a case management
system used in Post Office for a variety of services and is primarily used within the
Branch Support Centre. At the time of the HlJ in December 2019, the weekly
reviews that I have referred to above had generated a number of fixes that needed
to be released but there was no dedicated, consistent or centrally funded release
process for those fixes into the Horizon system.

1

=

. In April 2020, I understand that the then Head of IT Service (Retail), following
discussions with the then Chief Information Officer, Jeff Smyth, also sought further
details of the historical BEDs within the Horizon system to commence the process

of validating that they could not continue to cause an issue within the current

2 WITN03680200 - paragraph 403
Page 4 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

version of Horizon. It was subsequently established, following my appointment,
during the first stage of the Remediation Programme, that these BEDs had not
been replicated in the current version of Horizon. I have provided further detail
about the associated analysis exercise and its results in my second witness
statement.>

12. In the same month, the Horizon Improvements programme was set up and led by
Post Office’s then Head of Planning and Coordination. The focus of the programme
was to review improvements and fixes required in relation to the Horizon system.
In May 2020, a request for funding was raised to allow for the creation of specific
BED fix releases. The first of these releases, which also occurred in May 2020 and
was known as 7.20, included fixes for seven existing defects.

13.1 have reviewed email correspondence between the then Head of Planning and
Coordination and the then Head of IT Service (Retail) from early June 2020 to
which was attached the PEAK and KEL Process Document (which was dated 12
June 2020).4

14. The process was an earlier version of the Defect Management Process that I
introduced and have discussed at length in my second witness statement.5

15. That email correspondence also explained that new entries had been entered into
the Branch Support Centre system Microsoft Dynamics for each BED that had
been raised since the new process was established.

16. I have reviewed email correspondence between the then Chief Information Officer,
Jeff Smyth, and senior members of his team from August 2020 which followed the

appointment of the Director of Historical Matters, Declan Salter, within the Post

Office in August 2020. An overview pack was provided to Mr Salter which included
a process map®

17. It is my understanding that efforts had been put in train, from the spring of 2020
onwards, by the then Chief Information Officer, Jeff Smyth, to commence a

procurement exercise to appoint a third-party audit supplier to:

a) review the findings of the HlJ in relation to the matters detailed above in
paragraph 9; and
b) make associated recommendations to Post Office as to how to address

those findings.

18. The then Chief Information Officer has since left Post Office. However, in preparing
this statement, I have spoken with Post Office’s Director of Procurement, Liam
Carroll, and reviewed material provided to me by him in relation to the procurement
exercise and the steps that were taken pursuant to that exercise before my
appointment.

19. I have reviewed email correspondence from July 2020 which shows that, following
the Common Issues Judgment (“ClJ”) and HIJ, Post Office was setting up a
forensic investigation team within its IT function to support the response to the ClJ
and HlJ findings. However, whilst that recruitment exercise was being carried out,

Post Office decided to instruct an external consultancy firm to begin carrying out

the associated audit work.”

WITN03680300

20. It is my understanding that the procurement exercise to instruct external
consultants was progressed quite quickly and, by the end of July, the firm BDO
had been successful in the tender process.®

21. Thereafter, in August 2020, the scope of and funding of the audit work to be carried
out by BDO was further defined. It was recognised that Post Office, at that stage,
had “...a basic forensics and investigations capability’ which needed to be scaled
up to respond to the HlJ and ClJ findings. I have reviewed email correspondence
from that period which refers to the scope of the engagement as being for nine
months for three key deliverables with defined associated funding. These were as

follows:

a) “Horizon Audit capped T & M - £230,000
b) Operating Model capped T & M - £30,000

c) Training plan capped T & M - £30,000.”

22. Following the appointment of BDO, there were, by September 2020, concerns
regarding their engagement with and delivery pursuant to their contract.'°

23.1 commenced my role as Horizon IT Director on 16 September 2020. Shortly
thereafter, the previous Head of IT Service (Retail) joined my team as Head of the
Horizon Live Service. On my arrival into post, I was made aware of the engagement
to date with BDO. I have, for the purposes of preparing this statement, reviewed

correspondence that I had with BDO. That correspondence sets out how I sought

to ensure that key issues that were raised in the HlJ, namely historic KELs and
remote access to the Horizon system by Fujitsu, were prioritised within BDO’s audit
work.‘#

24. Following early engagement with Post Office and Fujitsu to discuss the approach
and outputs of their work, BDO elected to withdraw from the work. As a result, a
procurement exercise was undertaken and KPMG LLP ("KPMG") was
subsequently appointed to take this work forward.

25.\n paragraph 364 of my second witness statement, I explained that KPMG
prepared a draft setting out their findings in December 2020. I went on to state that;

“Amongst other matters, this audit noted that there had been no progress in
relation to privilege or elevated access controls within the Horizon environment
beyond the basis user enablement and access. It was also stated that Post

Office used limited controls around remote access".'2

R9(60)

Question 3(a)

How Post Office ensures effective management of POL’s present IT suppliers,

including in respect of Horizon

26. Post Office engages with a large number of IT suppliers across its business

operations, but I have focused this part of my response to R9(60) on Fujitsu, as

‘1 POL00447760, Email thread between Simon Oldnall and Liam Carroll regarding
Fujitsu, 28 September 2020
12 WITN03680200 - paragraph 364

Page 8 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

the supplier whose work is of particular relevance to the Inquiry’s Terms of
Reference.

27. In the HlJ, Mr Justice Fraser expressed significant concerns about the extent to
which Post Office was reliant on Fujitsu for the management of Horizon.
Specifically, he found that Post Office had limited control and oversight over the
day to day running of the system. As a result, since the HlJ, Post Office have made
changes to the way that its engagement with Fujitsu is managed so that Post Office
is in a better position to monitor whether Fujitsu is complying with its contractual
obligations, as I set out in my second statement. Some of this is operational, for
example around enhanced testing and defect management which has reduced
Post Office’s dependency on Fujitsu in respect of the identification and rectification
of BEDs."8

28. Post Office have also taken steps to develop a Horizon monitoring and alerting
capacity that is independent of Fujitsu. Post Office have introduced the App
Dynamics tooling to approximately 5,000 counters in the estate to monitor the
performance of the Horizon system. It yields a representative sample of network
performance statistics, transaction processing speed and the interactions between
the counters in branch and the Horizon Data Centre. It allows Post Office to be
alerted to more widespread issues before they impact branches or potentially
cause discrepancies. ‘4

29. In May 2015, Post Office entered into a contract with Verizon to take on the
management, and review Fujitsu’s provision, of the network that the Horizon

system uses to communicate with Post Office branches. As a result, any network

13 WITN0O3680200 — paragraphs 465-481
+4 WITN03680200 — paragraph 402(b)

Page 9 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

failures are now picked up through Verizon. These processes allow Post Office to
be informed of these issues independently of Fujitsu.

30. Fundamentally, however, Post Office remains in a contractual relationship with
Fujitsu which to a large extent governs the nature of its engagement. In some
respects that relationship has limited Post Office’s ability to mitigate its reliance on
Fujitsu.

3

. I propose to illustrate the practical implications of this by reference to two relatively
recent attempts by Post Office to test aspects of the system within Fujitsu’s control.
As part of its Horizon Issues Remediation Programme (which I will discuss in more
detail below) I asked my colleagues in Post Office’s Internal Audit department to
carry out reviews of particular aspects of Horizon which have been problematic in
the past. Internal Audit opted to co-source this work with Deloitte, which means
that Deloitte personnel carried out the review on behalf of Post Office.

32. In the first example, Internal Audit asked Deloitte to carry out a review of Privileged

Access Management ("PAM") in a small sample of Post Office branches to review

aspects of privileged'® and remote access’® rights to Horizon. The report was

intended to cover different types of access, including:

+8 Privileged access allows a restricted number of specialist support staff to make
approved changes to the Production environment. The use of these elevated levels
of access are documented as part of Change Control and require Post Office
approval. Privileged Access is comprised of three key elements: (i) The processes
around Privileged Access user account creation, routine validation, and revocation;
and (ii) The tools and processes implemented to enable Privileged Access user
activity monitoring; (iii) The level of visibility and impact for Post Office and
Postmasters when Privileged Access activities are undertaken.

16 Remote access allows an operator to perform actions on the system that they are
remotely connected to. These actions are restricted to the permissions that are
granted as a remote user.

Page 10 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

a) Fujitsu managed privileged remote access and associated transactional
integrity; and
b) In-branch use of Smart IDs by Postmasters and their staff, and Post Office

and third- party partners’ use of Global IDs.

33. The report was received in May 2024 (“the IA / Deloitte PAM Report’).'” It caused
considerable concern within Post Office because it reported that Fujitsu failed to
cooperate with the audit and provide Deloitte (and therefore Post Office) with
Horizon access to assess efficacy of privileged roles and profiles, as follows:

“Due to a lack of cooperation provided to the fieldwork team by Fujitsu, who are
responsible for managing privileged access to key components of HNG-A,
several intended scope elements could not be completed. Specifically,
Objective 1 of the audit (to assess the effectiveness of privileged access
controls over the HNG-A system) could not be achieved. Further, whilst the
Scope included a set of analytics related to validating TI across a six-month
dataset, this work could not be completed as a result (Objective 2: to
understand and report on counter transaction success rates and reasons for
transactional failure through analytical review of transaction metadata).”"®

34. In the second example, Internal Assurance co-sourced from Deloitte a review of
Reference Data systems. This was completed in June 2024 (“the IA / Deloitte
Reference Data Report’). Part of this report’s conclusions were that:

“... Further, controls operated by [Fujitsu] have not been assessed ... Due to

a lack of cooperation provided by Fujitsu stakeholders during fieldwork, several

WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

intended in scope work items ... could not be suitably performed, and therefore
the overall audit rating is “N/A — No Rating”.'®

35. In the IA / Deloitte PAM Report, the assessors reported that Fujitsu rely on the fact
that their contractual obligations do not extend to cooperating with such testing.?°

36. Clearly, Post Office continues to face significant challenges in this area. It is deeply
frustrating to me and to my colleagues at Post Office that in circumstances where
Post Office relies on Fujitsu’s attestations, Fujitsu appear to be reluctant or
unwilling to facilitate testing on behalf of Post Office.

37. As I explained in my second witness statement, one aspect of Post Office’s regular
monitoring of Fujitsu’s contractual compliance is carried out through the annual
Ernst and Young audit of Fujitsu operations, which includes the process and
governance surrounding privileged access management.’ Discussions were had
with Fujitsu to expand the scope of that audit for this year, to take into account
some of the matters that ought to have been covered by the IA / Deloitte PAM
Report. It will remain the case however that aspects of that audit will be dependent
on Fujitsu’s own assurances, rather than having been the subject of external
testing.

38. Post Office is presently seeking to negotiate the extension of Horizon beyond 2025
with Fujitsu. I understand that colleagues in Post Office will be looking, through
those negotiations, to address some of the concerns about the Post Office’s ability

to subject Fujitsu's services to auditing and testing where necessary.

WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

39. I would wish to add on the topic of the IA / Deloitte PAM Report and the IA / Deloitte
Reference Data Report that I consider, on reflection, that I ought to have included
reference to these documents in my second witness statement, because they do
properly form part of Post Office’s means of monitoring Fujitsu’s contractual
compliance with certain of its obligations. I regret not having done so and can only

say that this was an oversight, for which I apologise.

Questions 3(b), (c) and (4)- How the Post Office has endeavoured to improve

Postmasters’ user experience in relation to the Horizon system and how it is

seeking to ensure that the IT issues of the past are not repeated.

40. I have, due to the crossovers and links between the responses to Questions 3(b),
3(c) and 4 of R9(60), and to avoid unnecessary duplication, provided one
amalgamated response to all three questions.

41. Post Office has undertaken a detailed and rigorous programme of work to
remediate the issues with Horizon identified in the HlJ. In doing so, Post Office has
sought to address the issues of the past in so far as the Horizon system is
concerned and rebuild Postmaster trust.

42. Post Office has met (and will continue to endeavour to meet) these priorities

through:

a) The Horizon Issues Remediation Programme (which I discussed in my
second witness statement and will detail further below);

b) Ongoing work to improve and invest in the Horizon system;

c) The replacement of Horizon with a new in-branch core trading platform,

through the Strategic Platform Modernisation Programme (“SPMP”);

Page 13 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

The Horizon Issues Remediation Programme

43. Shortly after the HlJ, Post Office instigated a scheme of work to thematically
address all 15 of the findings from the HlJ.22 Internally this is referred to as the
Horizon Issues Remediation Programme ("the Remediation Programme").

44. When I was appointed in September 2020, my primary responsibility was to
manage the programme, and to build a team to organise and implement the
technical changes required to be made to Horizon to ensure that the findings were

addressed.

Post-HIJ Review of Horizon and Strategy for Remediation
45. Practical work under the Horizon Issues Remediation Programme commenced in
late 2020. In what later came to be considered ‘Phase 1’ of the Remediation
Programme, Post Office instigated a ‘fast fix’ programme to prioritise critical items
and aspects of work that could be undertaken quickly. I set out some components
of this work in more detail below, but for example, Post Office rolled out a pilot for
a new Postmaster dispute mechanism with improved end to end investigation
processes. In consultation with Fujitsu, 62 historical defects were resolved and the
Update Horizon Technology Team designed a new process to manage current
defects (which I detail further below). An Internal Audit of Phase 1 work in June
2021 reported that there had been:
“...measurable improvements in Horizon processes, controls and oversight,

including more robust management of KELS (Known Error Logs), enhanced

22 WITN03680200 -Paragraphs 404-405
Page 14 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

testing and oversight of system and data changes, more secure and
transparent Horizon application support, and laying the groundwork for
enhanced Postmaster communications and programme management.”?3

46. Alongside this, as detailed above, in October 2020 Post Office engaged KPMG to
provide an independent assessment of the progress Post Office had made to
address Horizon issues and to make recommendations against its observations,
partly with a view ultimately to assisting Post Office to report on this work to the
Inquiry (“the KPMG Report’).

47. The final version of the KPMG Report was provided in June 2021, based on
observations conducted between October 2020 and April 2021. Unfortunately, the
report took longer than anticipated to deliver, which KPMG explained was on the
grounds that Fujitsu’s cooperation in this process was not straightforward. The
report explains that, “... due to delays as we waited for Fujitsu to provide input in
the form of written responses to our questions’.2° To summarise, KPMG’s

conclusions were:

a) That Post Office had already made some improvements in Horizon in
response to the HIJ (those changes were set out at paragraph 2.2 of the
KPMG Report and I set some of them out later in this statement against the
relevant thematic issue).
b) That significant remediation was still required, the scale of which would be

extensive. KPMG made 72 specific observations around eight themes of

23 POL00031790, Internal Audit Report: HlJ Phase 1 Validation, 7 July 2021

24 PCQL00030396, ‘Horizon Report / Report on the progress made to address six

Page 15 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

Governance, Processes, Capability, Culture and Conduct, Data, Systems, Supplier
and performance management and Technology.”° Six associated control areas
were identified which KPMG felt needed to be addressed in order to facilitate
sustained improvement and management pending the move to a new IT platform.
c) That Post Office needed, beyond the six issues identified, to address “a
series of more Foundational issues”.?’ These included that the established
organisational design and culture within the Post Office, and the way in
which process and risk were managed resulted in governance and process

gaps which means Post Office could not demonstrate consistent
management of Postmaster interests. Further, that the outsourcing of
services to third parties resulted in an assumed delegation of accountability

by Post Office role holders, and individuals had been primarily concerned

with their own area of responsibility with insufficient collaboration or

questioning of others.”8

48. Post Office accepted these observations and committed to addressing them,
through both the Remediation Programme described in this statement and through
wider work carried out within Post Office in relation to Postmaster experiences and
Post Office culture which I understand my colleague has addressed in another

statement.29

49. KPMG noted that Post Office’s plan of work had support from the Group Executive

and emphasised that this would need to be sustained for the length of

remediation,*° and recommended an oversight board was established to

coordinate and govern the remediation programme. Post Office therefore brought

the Remediation Programme under the governance and monitoring of the

Improvement Delivery Group.

50. After the receipt of the KPMG Report in June 2021 two further phases of work

were rolled out over the subsequent 24 months. Phase 2 delivered changes

across three main workstreams:

a)

b)

system and data improvements - by early 2022°? there had been system
and data improvements concerning 148 user and data journey maps, which
means there is now a clearer set of instructions about the sequence that
transactions follow and what happens to the data created from each such
transition, minimising the possibility for confusion and error;

demand, change and release processes - Post Office worked with Fujitsu to
remove multiple redundant Horizon buttons, implemented updated process
flows for ideation, demand, release and change, and piloted a new
ServiceNow Demand management system to manage Horizon change,
implementing 200 new IT controls through this. In simple terms, what this
means is that there are now more checks to ensure that changes made to

the system follow each of the steps that they are supposed to, which makes

areas derived from HIJ Findings’, KPMG LLP, June 2021, V4.2, Page 16

the system more reliable and less prone to error. Post Office also enhanced
testing to support the new defect management process designed in Phase
1 and agreed remote access reporting requirements and security incident
event management with Fujitsu;

c) investigations processes and data - Post Office developed standardised
reports for use in all investigations, an investigations dashboard, and

investigations case management tools.°*

51. In Phase 3, from about mid-2022, Post Office was in a position to address difficult
issues which required greater investment or third-party engagement and to embed
and sustain the changes made in Phases 1 and 2. In particular, it was intended
that Post Office would design and launch new applications, ‘Branch Hub on
Horizon’ and ‘Branch Reporting Suite’ to make reporting data available for self-
service, ensure a ‘least Privileged Access Management model’ was in place, and
commission an externally-led audit of Fujitsu concentrating on Privileged Access
Management/Remote Access Management.

52. These have been the most challenging aspects of the Remediation Programme
and Post Office have not succeeded in implementing all of them. Perhaps the most
significant was the failure of Post Office to execute its 2020 plan to extract the part
of Horizon that resided at the Fujitsu Belfast Data Centre and place it in a Post
Office-owned Amazon Web Services structure. Post Office intended through this
to obtain control over and unimpeded access to the data that Horizon produced.
That strategy came to be referred to within Post Office as ‘the Belfast Exit

Programme’. One of the benefits of this Programme was that it should enable Post

Office to make that data more readily available to Postmasters in turn through the
‘Branch Reporting Suite’ counter-top application that Post Office intended to
develop. Ultimately however, the cost and technical complexity of this project
proved prohibitive, and in September 2023 the Board accepted a recommendation
from the Horizon Remediation Programme Phase 3 SteerCo that the Branch
Reporting Suite work would need to be paused indefinitely. At this stage, the
estimated costs of its delivery were £3,042,100.

53. Many improvements however have been successfully delivered by the
Remediation Programme and an Internal Audit report on 17 January 2024 found
that of 100 tasks that were promised, 73 had been delivered, four were in progress,
seven were paused and 16 had been re-scoped. The Remediation Programme
closed at the end of the financial year 2024, and outstanding work to improve
Horizon continues to be managed through discrete projects or ‘business as usual’
functions, overseen by the Horizon System Improvement SteerCo and subject to

the approval of the Horizon Solution Authority.

Thematic review of Horizon Remediation

54. Mr Justice Fraser’s 15 findings about Horizon can be grouped against five major

themes:54

2 - Sub Postmasters were not informed about identified
defects. Some defects were not identified by automatic

3 - Legacy Horizon and HNG-X were not remotely robust,

as identified by the number of defects found

4 - Data errors, arising from data entry, transfer or
processing in both legacy Horizon and HNG-X led to
financial discrepancies. Errors in reference data, and 3%

Causes of Shortfalls

in Branch Accounts

55. In this section of my statement, I describe the improvements made to the Horizon
system against each of the first four of these (having dealt with the fifth, reliance

on Fujitsu, as part of my answer to Question 3(a) above at paragraphs 26-39).

Management of Horizon Defects

56. Mr Justice Fraser found that BEDs had the potential to undermine the reliability of
Horizon to accurately process and record transactions. Post Office has carried out
significant remediation work in this area and a number of changes have been
made.

57. Post Office established a Horizon Testing Team of 11 Post Office IT Employees
whose role was to have oversight of changes made to the Horizon platform,
whether made by Post Office or Fujitsu. The Horizon Testing Team's objective is
thus to identify areas of functionality where the system is not working as expected
or does not meet the requirements set out by Post Office. Testing occurs either at
the time a change to the system is proposed or following the identification and
remediation of a BED. If a BED is detected in the live Horizon system, it is reported
to the IT service desk ("ITSD"). The ITSD analysts have a set of knowledge-based
articles to which they can refer when BEDs are reported, and when there is a BED,
this will be subject to a knowledge-based article. The ITSD can then refer to the
article in the event that a problem associated with the BED is raised to them. The

BED is then managed through the Defect Management Process which I described

Page 22 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

in my second statement.*> Through these means, Post Office have established
governance to proactively track and resolve Horizon defects, with the process now
led and owned by Post Office.

58. In Phase 1 of the Remediation Programme, the Testing Team examined the status
of historic BEDs that were specifically referred to in the HIJ findings. Fujitsu were
asked to provide a report which enabled Post Office to analyse these BEDs. Post
Office then arranged and led workshop sessions with Fujitsu staff to understand

the status of the BEDs within the Horizon system. The analysis determined that:

a) Out of 63 known errors, 46 could be closed as the core system and
functionality had extensively changed since the errors were raised and
therefore the specific problems would not occur again;

b) Of the remaining 17 errors, Post Office and Fujitsu determined that three
had been resolved and 14 required re-testing to validate whether or not they
still existed in the platform;

c) 3of those 14 errors were the subject of reports made by Postmasters which
had insufficient technical information to determine the cause, so no further

action could be taken.

59. Testing of the remaining 11 errors was successfully completed by Post Office,
confirming these to have been fixed and no longer prevalent in Horizon. Post Office
can therefore be confident that all 62 historical defects referenced in the HIJ have
been fully re-tested to ensure they are not present in the current version of Horizon.

60. Through the processes that I have described above, Post Office now has systems

for the formal identification, categorisation and remediation of BEDs, which ought

35 WITN03680200 — paragraph 402(c)
Page 23 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

to prevent the sorts of problems that had the potential to arise in the past from
doing so now and in the future. These changes ensure Post Office is proactively
identifying and resolving Horizon defects at an early stage and therefore reducing
any impact on Postmaster branch operations. New testing identifies on average

four new defects each month before these reach the live production environment.

Privileged and Remote Access

61. The HIJ identified that a problem from the past was Post Office’s lack of oversight
over Fujitsu’s use of privileged and remote access rights. A number of changes
have since been made to improve Post Office’s ability to monitor Fujitsu’s
compliance with its contractual obligations to maintain a secure system, several of

which were detailed in my second statement.*® For example:

a) Post Office have implemented a revised process for the use of elevated or
privileged access, with a greater emphasis on Postmaster communication.
Any Fujitsu remote access needs pre-approval from senior Fujitsu
management, Post Office's Horizon IT and Retail Operations teams and
also requires the involvement of the relevant Postmaster, who is informed
of the reason for the access sought in every instance.3”

b) Horizon Privileged Account Reporting provides details of when a privileged
account is used, with date stamps. The access is tied to a unique username

so can be tracked and traced.°*

36 WITN03680200 — paragraphs 465-481
37 WITN03680200 — paragraph 492
38 WITN03680200 — paragraph 487

Page 24 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

c) Weekly, date stamped reporting of remote connections made to a Horizon
counter allows Post Office to identify why and when remote access is made
to establish any common patterns of activity.°9

d) Monthly reporting on any failed log-in attempted by Fujitsu staff allows Post
Office to identify any potentially suspicious activity.4°

e) Post Office have implemented over 200 IT controls into our Control
framework, which are managed and audited via the ServiceNow enabled
Controls process.4"

f) Any remote access is also retrospectively analysed by the Post Office
Horizon Technology Risk and Security Team to ensure that all approval
steps were followed.2

g) Finally, as part of the Horizon Issues Remediation Programme, the IT Team
schedule weekly meetings to ensure that operational discussions can take
place between Post Office IT specialists and Fujitsu. The meetings allow the
team to track Fujitsu's progress on a weekly basis and look at overall
performance in relation to the relevant contractual obligations. Any matters
discussed at these weekly meetings are fed back into the general monthly

meetings.

62. These measures are being subjected to internal scrutiny to ensure that they are
held to high standards. For example, Internal Audit provided a review of the

resulting IT Control Framework on 14 March 2023“ which identified considerable

39 WITN03680200 — paragraph 487

40 WITNO3680200 — paragraph 487

41 WITN03680200- paragraphs 429(a), 448, 449 and 440.

42 WITN03680200 — paragraph 492

43 WITN03680200 — paragraph 474

“4 POL00448324, Internal Audit Report: IT Control Framework, 14 March 2023

Page 25 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

work that was required to enhance the framework and address control gaps,
resulting in a rating of ‘Needs Improvement. Any identified actions were completed
in accordance with the recommendations detailed in the report, as none now
remain outstanding.

63. As I described at paragraph 32 above, a similar Internal Audit report was
conducted in respect of Privileged Access Management — the IA / Deloitte PAM
Report. I set out above how Post Office are responding to the problem about the
lack of cooperation from Fujitsu in assessing the effectiveness of its privileged
access controls over the Horizon system. I now deal with the substantive findings
on the aspects of scope that its authors were able to report on.

64. The IA / Deloitte PAM Report had six main findings. On receipt of these I had
discussions with the authors of the report at Deloitte in order to properly understand
them. I also tabled them at the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (“ARC”)
meeting in May 2024 and agreed to report at the next Committee meeting how
these findings should be interpreted in the context of Post Office’s work in the
Horizon Remediation Programme. As I reported to the ARC in July 2024, my view
and understanding of the report’s findings is as follows.

65. Several of the report's main findings and criticisms relate to branch-level privileged
access (Global and Smart IDs), which is different from historical concerns about
transaction integrity potentially being affected by remote access that were the focus

of criticism in the HlJ. The findings of the report in this respect relate to:

a) Absence of regular policy updates and associated change management,
b) Smart ID branch-level privileged access control limitations,

c) Global ID cross-branch access management deviations; and

Page 26 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

d) Poor timelines of ongoing and compliance with privileged access review

and associated maintenance activities.

66. There are two important findings that relate to the sort of remote access
considered in the HlJ.

67. First, the report highlighted gaps in the way that Fujitsu reports to Post Office about
its use of the APPSUP account. It was found that:

“Details of the activity performed by users whilst having access to this account
are not reported”, “no first-line assurance mechanisms operate to validate the
completeness and accuracy of the reporting” and “report parameters are not
provided to POL, with reporting pre-formatted by Fujitsu into a standardised
template.”45

68.1 accept that this finding calls into question the adequacy of the some of the
improvements made as part of HlJ remediation to Fujitsu’s reporting on the use of
privileged access that I have set out above. The recommendations were that I
should engage Fujitsu to improve on its APPSUP account usage reporting and
configure regular reporting on overuse of such access rights. I agree that this
needs to be progressed. Post Office is therefore looking to make the necessary
enhancements and is currently discussing these with Fujitsu.

69. Second, the report found because of insufficient branch-level privileged access
management, “system managed [Transaction Acceptance ("TA") and Transaction
Correction ("TC")] approvals cannot be relied upon”. This is a potentially troubling
finding and I am working to verify it, because the impact on branch accounts of any

misuse of branch-level access ought to be nought or very limited in light of the

45 POL00448344, Internal Audit Report: HNG-A: Privileged Access Management, 8
May 2024

Page 27 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

limited functionality available to users with a Global ID (which is the privileged
access referred to in this finding). I am in discussions with the report's authors
about the basis of their finding and the evidence used to reach this finding. Once
that is clear, the problem can then be diagnosed and addressed.

70. I also accept the criticisms made in the report about the sample size of 15 ‘friendly’
branches that was used in the fieldwork that underpinned the report. These
branches were chosen because it is our experience that they are willing to
participate and are responsive to such auditing and testing work. I recognise this
means the findings of the report are somewhat limited and, in future, will look to
commission similar work across a much wider and more representative sample of
branches.

71. Whilst the report makes for concerning reading in several respects, I would
emphasise that it was commissioned in order that weaknesses around Privileged
Access Management could be identified and rectified. I welcome its rigour and the
opportunity to make the corrections to Post Office’s processes we now know are
required. This is an iterative and challenging process that enables Post Office to
be confident that, on an ongoing basis, we are looking for and taking steps to

resolve problems rather than waiting for them to manifest.

Reference and Third-Party Data

72. The Horizon system is underpinned by a database that interfaces with branch
counter terminals. That database includes tables of Reference and Third-Party
Data, which can be updated centrally by Post Office (and by Fujitsu on Post Office's

behalf) subject to Reference Data Management Processes. Reference data

Page 28 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

includes for example the text that is shown in message and dialogue boxes or the
prices of Horizon Products.

73. Following the HlJ, it was clear that Post Office needed to make improvements to
those Reference Data Management Processes to mitigate the risk that flaws in
those processes could contribute to errors and discrepancies in accounting and
finance data.

74. Post Office have made a number of substantial changes to Reference Data

Management Processes since the HIJ:

a) The introduction of a clear end-to-end Change Request process for both
Reference Data and AP-ADC changes (which is a scripting language for
the capture of information at the counter which facilitates transactions),
managed by ServiceNow which provides clear accountability for sign offs
for changes to the system.

b) Transparency of request visibility enabling assurance around changes.

c) Automation and auditability improvements through leveraging our service

management tooling.

75. A separate programme of work has implemented changes to how data is

transferred from and to Horizon, including:

a) The procurement and implementation of a commercial ‘off the shelf’ file
transfer platform; Post Office is in the process of migrating its legacy file
transfer routes and will be moving more than 300 file transfer routes that
service more than 1000 individual file transfers across Horizon. This work is

due to complete, as I explain further below, in February 2025.

Page 29 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

b) The replacement of the reference data driven APOP voucher authorisation
platform which provides the ability to make pay outs to, for example, energy

customers.

76. Post Office are additionally in the process of designing a new audit store for
Horizon which will enable the storage of audit data for all branch transactions to be
within Post Office itself, for the first time. This means the process to retrieve Audit
data (“ARQ”) will in future be executed by Post Office, whereas historically this has
been wholly managed by Fujitsu.

77. As with Remote Access, I have sought to have this work rigorously assessed and
to that end, in January 2023, I asked Post Office’s Internal Audit department to
commission a review of Reference Data Management Processes for Horizon.
Internal Audit co-sourced this so that it was carried out by Deloitte on similar terms
to those that I have explained above in paragraph 31. This was completed in June
2024.

78. As with the IA / Deloitte PAM Report, the IA / Deloitte Reference Data Report
reported a lack of cooperation from Fujitsu in some respects, which I have
commented on above. In respect of the testing this report's authors were able to

carry out, the report identified two categories of control weaknesses:

a) a lack of counter-level verification and supporting documents for sampled
changes; and

b) improvement opportunities in Reference Data process documentation.4*

48 POL00448330, Draft Internal Audit Report: HNG-A: Reference Data Report,
February 2024

Page 30 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

79. I accept that Post Office have some important work to do in addressing these
issues and the report shows that there has been agreement about the work that
managers need to take forward. Whilst Post Office do have detailed and extensive
documentation around the process for changes to Reference Data, which is both
clear and well understood internally, and I am exploring how it came to be that this
was not apparent during the reviewing process, I do accept that process
documentation can always be improved. I am continuing to have discussions with

Deloitte in this regard.

Discrepancies and Shortfalls

80. To address the findings of the HlJ in relation to these topic areas, Post Office has
undertaken a programme of work to analyse and address the use and application
of TCs over the last three years. I understand that this will be discussed further in
the statement of Melanie Park in response to the questions posed by the Inquiry in
Rule 9(58), namely Questions 41 and 42 of Section F4”. A major initiative that was
intended to remedy the historic problem of Postmasters’ lack of access to data
about transactions and branch accounts was the Branch Reporting Suite. This was
originally planned for Phase 3 of the Horizon Remediation Programme. If
implemented as designed, this would have provided Postmasters with a platform
on their existing counter-top terminals to access transaction data themselves on
demand, which would have allowed them to interrogate the records of transactions

whenever they wished to do so. This would have addressed some of the other HIJ

47 WITN11600100 - First Witness Statement of Melanie Park on behalf of Post Office
Limited in the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

Page 31 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

findings, for example by allowing easy review on a screen of transactions thereby
removing the need for the use of paper till rolls.

81. Regrettably, and despite extensive efforts, Post Office have not been able to
deliver this change to Horizon. This is largely because, in order to do so, Post
Office needed to extract the part of Horizon that resided at the Fujitsu Belfast Data
Centre, and place it in a Post Office-owned Amazon Web Services structure which,
as I describe above at paragraph 52, was unable to be successfully delivered.

82. However, I understand that Post Office’s new branch IT system (“NBIT”), which I
provide further information about below, will have this functionality. This is therefore
an example of work to improve Horizon which, in the context of parallel plans to
introduce NBIT, it has not been proportionate for Post Office to invest public funds

in at this stage.

Ongoing Improvement work and investment

83. Phase 3 of the Remediation Programme is now complete. The requirement for
other ongoing Horizon system improvements is the subject of evaluation and will
be scrutinised to see whether it is appropriate for these to be funded. If they are,
they will be taken forward either through specific individual projects or through the
‘business as usual’ function within the Technology department.

84. Current ‘business as usual’ or specific projects which Post Office is engaged with

that seek to address some of the problems of the past are:

a) By February 2025, Post Office will have designed, tested and implemented
a new Audit solution for Horizon enabling greater transparency on the

transmission of transaction records;

Page 32 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

b) By February 2025, Post Office will complete the migration of over a 1000 file
transfers to the new routing service;

c) By February 2025, Post Office will replace the Horizon Audit SAN (as
explained above in paragraph 84a);

d) Continuing improvement resulting from the feedback loop created by the
greater visibility of individual discrepancies to Postmasters. Post Office is
now continuously considering feedback from Postmasters which results in
identification of defects, which are in turn assessed and fixed through an
ongoing development cycle with Fujitsu. For example, as a result of
Postmaster feedback, the process of ‘remming in’ of stock is in the process
of becoming automated. Postmasters will be able to scan a barcode and the
contents of the pouch will be remitted into the branch by these means to
avoid manual error. I understand that the pilot implementation is scheduled
for September 2024, with a full rollout planned thereafter, which is likely to

take place in 2025 and 2026.

85. This programme of work will be managed and tracked by the Horizon System
Improvement SteerCo, which I chair, and which is attended by representatives from
Post Office’s finance, retail, commercial and legal functions.

86. In November 2023, the Horizon Technology Team (“HTT”) provided a detailed
self-assessment of the status of the HlJ outcomes as set by the Post Office
following the internal analysis, remediation work and the associated oversight and
assessment of that work that was carried out post the HlJ. I have detailed the extent

of that analysis and work in paragraphs 45-82 above, and in my second witness

Page 33 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

statement*® . It was agreed by IDG 2.0 that Post Office’s Group Assurance team
should perform an objective desktop review based on the information and evidence
supporting completion that had been provided by HTT. This review was carried out
between March and July 2024. At the time of the review, whilst every effort was
made to provide evidence of completion in respect of each of the 37 HIJ
deliverables referred to in the report that was prepared following the review’, I
recognise that there is further evidence that needs to be provided. As a result, I am
working closely with the Group Assurance team to agree how best to source and
present this evidence of completion going forwards. These discussions between
my team and the Group Assurance team are continuing and it is my understanding
that these ongoing discussions are likely to be reflected in further updated versions

of the Group Assurance Team’s report that I refer to and have exhibited above.

The creation of a new in-branch IT platform

87. The Strategic Platform Modernisation Programme ("SPMP") aims to replace
Horizon with a new in-branch core trading platform, which will be known as the
New Branch IT system (“NBIT”). The purpose of NBIT is to support the product
and back-office functions that are delivered in branches. This system has been
designed and is being built by Post Office taking into account extensive feedback
from Postmasters.

88.1 have had no personal involvement in or knowledge of SPMP. The information
that is detailed below has been provided to me by Post Office’s CTrO, Chris

Brocklesby, with overall responsibility for NBIT.

«© WITN03680200- paragraph 404 —452.
«© POL00448752 - HIJ Conformance- Group Assurance Review — 16 August 2024

Page 34 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

89. It is my understanding that it was initially proposed that NBIT would be deployed
in a manner that enabled Post Office to exit its contract with Fujitsu for the provision
of Horizon support services by March 2025.

90. However, due to delays in the development and rollout of the system, the
deployment of the NBIT system is now due to start in June 2026 and be completed
by December 2028. I exhibit to this statement the current delivery map for the build
and rollout of the NBIT system, which details the key stages in the remaining build
and development processes and the associated proposed dates®. It is my
understanding that this has been approved by Post Office's SteerCo, Investment
Committee and the Post Office Board.

91. The system has been built on modern cloud technology. It is my understanding
that the system will also be more intuitive, user-friendly and quicker to access and
use and will enable Postmasters to provide a more efficient service for their
customers.

92. For example, for booking in stamp stock, counts, transfers and the sale of stamps,
the relevant in-branch user will no longer need to try and find a product on the
system. Instead, it is my understanding that they will be able to scan a barcode
which should result in fewer errors and discrepancies in branch in relation to the
booking in of stock.

93. It is also my understanding that the user will be able to manage their discrepancies
outside of the monthly balance process. This will be achieved by creating a
separate account that can be accessed and managed at any time, allowing users
more time to investigate and resolve any discrepancies in branch. All Postmaster

decisions or actions in relation to discrepancies will be captured on the system

50 POL00447899, Strategic Platform Modernisation Programme Delivery Roadmap
Page 35 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

which will ensure increased visibility for both the Postmaster and Post Office
management.

94. It is my understanding that there is an intention to create a full, accessible audit
trail for all variances identified, showing whether they relate to cash, stock or
currency. This is not something that is currently available to Postmasters using the
Horizon system.

95. All data that relates to balancing transactions and discrepancy data will be retained
and accessible to Postmasters for a six-year period as opposed to the forty-five-
day period that data currently remains available for within the Horizon system.
Wider system data will also remain available for up to two years.

96. It is my understanding that there will also be no need for users to print and retain
paper copies of any back-office reports or documents as the system will also allow
users to download these reports.

97. The transaction log will be simplified with additional data available in a basket view,
if required. It is my understanding that this will mean that it will be quicker for the
in-branch users to identify particular transaction sessions and, if needed, identify
any discrepancies.

98.1 have also been advised that a new cash reconciliation report will provide full
visibility of all cash movements in a selected time period, allowing users to compare
what was expected during that period and what actually happened in branch and
identify any discrepancies.

99. A dedicated Programme team has been created for SPMP within Post Office which
is headed by Post Office’s CTrO. In addition, it is my understanding that there is
oversight and governance within Post Office of decision-making associated with

the SPMP which can be summarised as follows:

Page 36 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

a) The Workstream Requirements Teams sit within each pillar of SPMP to
define specific business requirements.
b) The SPM demand checkpoint is a scheduled meeting which works to the

following Terms of Reference:

i. Review all new changes/requirements for the SPM programme
to deliver.

ii. Raise visibility of the types and number of new requirements
across the SPM programme areas including standard business
as usual changes.

iii. Process incoming requirements from multiple sources and

progress to the Business Design Authority if required (see further

below).
iv. Review open Impact Analysis and chase for an update.
Vv. Review completed Impact Analysis and confirm the outcome

before submitting to the requestor.

c) The SPMP demand checkpoint escalates decision-making to the NBIT

Business Design Authority (“BDA”) if the following criteria are met:

i. An item represents a significant impact to NBIT delivery (i.e. time
or cost).

ii. Itis unclear whether a particular item meets the primary objective
of replacing Horizon.

iii. The requirement could be met by an alternative solution as exists

on Horizon today.

Page 37 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

iv. There is a significant impact to the Postmaster by delivering a

requirement/specific solution.

100. It is my understanding that it would only be decisions that significantly impact on
other programmes, budgets or delivery plans within Post Office that should be
escalated to the Programme Board or Steering Committee.

101. I am aware that Postmasters have been at the heart of the design and build of
the NBIT system and there has and will continue to be widespread Postmaster
engagement as the system continues to be developed prior to its eventual rollout.

102. It is my understanding that there have been dedicated sessions of Post Office’s
Horizon IT Working Group since June 2021 in which the priority has been to ensure
that Postmasters can inform the design and build decisions from the earliest stages
in the new system’s development covering a wide range of operational, technical
and training practices.5' The engagement sessions were hosted by subject matter
experts within the NBIT programme team and were, and I understand will continue
to be, facilitated by two representatives from the Postmaster Engagement Team
and were attended by Postmasters. The sessions were also recorded to ensure
that any feedback or learning from the sessions could then be cascaded to the
relevant NBIT product teams. It is my understanding that the product teams then
used the feedback gained to inform the final designs for the NBIT system.

103. In addition to the feedback received from these sessions, it is my understanding
that there have also been 250 separate pieces of individual Postmaster feedback
which have been obtained through the pilots of the NBIT system, demonstrations

of the NBIT system and, most recently, at the Postmaster conference. This

51 POL00447897, Postmaster New Branch IT (NBIT) Engagement, 24 May 2024
Page 38 of 46
WITNO03680300
WITN03680300

feedback has been categorised by the NBIT programme team and is then, I
understand, provided to the individual development or training teams for action.52
104. The NBIT Postmaster Engagement Summary is intended to be a live record of
Postmaster engagement and will, I understand, be updated monthly to reflect
ongoing activity. The document details the engagement with Postmasters during
the IT Working Group Sessions that are referred to above, and the wider efforts
that Post Office has made to engage with Postmasters regarding the development

of and creation of training for the NBIT system have been detailed in.

Addressing the findings of the HIJ and ClJ in the development of SPMP/NBIT

105. As I explained in my second witness statement a review of the current Horizon
system was carried out as part of the Horizon Remediation Programme, following
which problem statements®> for each of the areas of potential improvement were
agreed via the Horizon Design Review Forum ("HDRF").® It is my understanding
that, subsequently, on 16 April 2024, the Inquiry Assurance lead for SPMP took
those problem statements to the BDA to confirm their inclusion for consideration
within the scope of SPMP. The purpose of this was, I understand, to ensure that
there was a formal governance record of these items being included in scope and

to ensure it was formally communicated to the relevant SPMP team.5”

* WITN03680200- paragraphs 477 and 480.

55 Problem statements are observations around a set of users or product journeys on
Horizon and where it has been identified that these may lead to processing errors
and discrepancies.

56 The HDRF was a sub-group of IDG which was set up in order to review the output
of the Horizon system improvements workstream in the HIJ programme.

106. To assist in making those assessments, it is my understanding that the Scope
and Requirements team have worked with the NBIT Commercial and Back Office
Teams to review the problem statements and align which problems are in scope,
those not in scope and identifying next steps where required.

107. It is my understanding that the NBIT team has then identified the appropriate
resolver team within the programme to resolve each of the problems associated
with those requirements. By way of example, where one of the requirements
identified a training issue, I understand that the associated problem statement was
sent to the NBIT training team to resolve. Where requirements were linked to
software issues, the associated problem statements have, I understand, been

passed to the relevant development team.

Training and support for Postmasters prior to and following rollout

108. In September 2023, Post Office published a Training Deployment Model for the
NBIT system.®* The Training Deployment Model is intended to cover employees in
retail branch facing roles, which includes Postmasters,®® and its purpose is to
ensure that all users are confident and competent to use NBIT to fulfil their role
requirements from day one of the system going live.

109. Following the NBIT system going live in the branches, there will, I understand,

be:

a) SPMP team members in place in the branches for at least the first week (as

has been the case with the initial releases of NBIT).

paragraph 3.1

b) The opportunity for each branch to have a daily “stand-up call” for the first
few weeks to ensure that Post Office is able to identify and take steps to
resolve any initial issues with the system and gather wider feedback from
the branch staff.

c) A dedicated hypercare support team who the branch can contact on an
ongoing basis if they have any issues.

d) Additional training provided to support the deployment of additional system

capabilities after ‘go live’.

Conclusion

110. In response to Question 5 of R9(60), I have nothing further to add to the
statements I have already made to the Inquiry or earlier in this statement that I feel
to be relevant to the Inquiry’s Terms of Reference which the Chairman ought to be

aware of.

Statement of Truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.
