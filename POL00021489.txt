POLBO05/104 HORIZON PROPOSITION POLB(05)84

(a) Ric Francis introduced Dave Smith and lan O'Driscoll. A
presentation was provided on Horizon Next Generation. The
Board noted that:

(b) the current proposal would almost halve the cost of Horizon and
then reduce ongoing costs year on year. The original Fujitsu
proposal had not met this objective, and the new proposal had
been achieved. after hard negotiation;

(c) the original proposal would have resulted in a front-end spend
of £150m, in addition to a fair amount of risk. The current
proposal had removed £140m of cost by ‘sweating’ the existing
assets within the operation for a long as possible. This would
remove the need to have such a large initial capital outlay, but
would still result in the rolling out to all 14,500 branches;

(d) the proposal would still required a £50m front-end cost to pay
fora shared data centre and a ‘lights out’ facility. However, it
would not result in a penalty payment for breach of contract;

(e) the current proposal resulted in an acceptable and achievable
cost profile, and an agreement had been reached in principle
with Fujitsu of new ways of working. The alternative would be to
buy out the existing contract at a cost of £80m, disaggregate
the services, and select an SI partner to manage the
development and integration. This could deliver lower cost but
would result in a significantly higher risk and a longer delivery
time;

(f) The other key features of the new proposal were:
(i) improved availability;
(ii) cost effective service management;
(iii) significant network savings;
(iv) SI Partnership;
(v) the duration of the contract would be until 2015.

(g) David Burden had been briefed on the proposals;

(h) the Board noted the progress that had been achieved, and
agreed to the approach and to £6m investment that would be I
