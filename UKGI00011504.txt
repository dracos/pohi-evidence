I Post Office Horizon system: possible errors leading to postmaster being accused of
i fraud

T enclose two emails which I have received from a constituent Mr David Bristow of Odiham Post
Office, High Street, Odiham, Hampshire, RG29. I note the Parliamentary Question raised by Brooks
1 Newmark MP on 12 October and the reply dated 13 October from Alan Cook, Managing Director of
i Post Office Ltd.

} Nonetheless there does appear to be a significant number of postmasters and postmistresses
accused of fraud who claim that the Horizon system is responsible, including at least two in my
constituency.

Given the level of impact this has on the personal lives of these postmasters and postmistresses
and their families, often involving bankruptcy and certainly significant financial hardship, I should

be most grateful if you would let me have your comments on what can be done to investigate the
matter.

Subject: RE: Post Office threats!

Dear Mr Arbuthnot,

Today I received another threatening letter from the Post Office this time saying it-is the last letter
before action.

I now believe I know where the problem might be.
I have discovered how to send transactions through the Horizon system which will appear on an
Alliance and Leicester bank account but will appear as Zero on the Horizon system,

I,m sure you will also find this interesting I found it on Mr Newmark MP,s website,
Mr Bristow

i 12 October 2009 : Parliamentary Question

i Post Office Horizon System

: Mr. Newmark: To ask the Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
whether he has received reports of errors in the Post Office Horizon system which have led to

i Postmasters or Postmistresses being falsely accused of fraud; and if he will make a statement.

} [291675]

i Mr. McFadden: The Department has received no such reports. Any issues relating to the Horizon

system are operational matters for Post Office Ltd. I have therefore asked Alan Cook, managing

director of Post Office Ltd., to respond directly to the hon. Member and a copy of his reply will be

placed in the House Libraries.

Subject: Post Office threats!

Dear Mr Arbuthnot,

My name is David Bristow, I run the Odiham Post Office in the High St.
Until 6 months ago I was the Sub postmaster, with a contract to operate the post office.

Post Office Ltd have however taken my contract away, and are demanding I pay them £42,000 +,
or they will commence legal proceedings.

My predicament is very similar to many postmasters/mistresses around the country.
You may be aware of the similar case of Mrs Hamilton at the South Warnborough Post Office.

This morning your colleague Mr David Jones MP phoned me about this matter.
One of his constituents has been subjected to the same problem.

He intends to request a public inquiry in the house of commons, concerning the Post Office and the
Horizon system.

He ask me to make you aware of my problem.
My solicitor from Tanner and Taylor will also be writing to you.

I would be very grateful to you for any attention that you can give this matter and support you can
give me and Mr Jones MP(Con).

yours sincerely,

David Bristow
