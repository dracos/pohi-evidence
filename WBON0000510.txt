Thanks for letting me know, Andy. Rob will take Monday’s meeting out of my diary.

One thing I’ve been ruminating on is the disclosure hearing that will take place in January. That could be a critical
hearing, and not just because the decisions made then on disclosure will require the client to do things which will be
difficult, will require a great deal of manpower, will cost millions and could even affect the efficient running of the
business. It will also involve consideration of, and could have a decisive bearing on, the subject matter of the second
trial. I’m very sorry I won't be available for it.

I’m struck by how long it’s taking the Judge to produce his judgment explaining his extraordinary decision on timing.
Best wishes,

Tony

Our slot at the GE has been shrunk to just 20mins due to other business that POL needs to deal with. This doesn't
leave sufficient time for us / you to cover any substantive points so you've been stood down and no longer need to
attend on Monday. I'll just go along and do 10 mins on the current position.

I suspect I'll get a question about whether to stick with you for trial or change to another Counsel now. My view, and
Rod and Jane's views, are that we stick with you. I'll let you know how that goes.

Kind regards
Andy

Thanks Tony. Yes — a pre-call would be a good idea.
Let me fix a time for speaking to Jane and then I'll let you know.

Dear Andy,
Yes, of course. I’ve just spoken to Rob and he will be contacting you very shortly.

I wonder whether you and I ought to have a 10 minute call immediately before the call with Jane, to help (re)focus my
mind on the client's priorities?

Yours,

Tony

We've got a meeting with Post Office's General Executive on Monday 13 Nov. Exact time has not yet been set yet. I
would expect it to last about an hour.

Would you be available for a call sometime next week with Jane at POL to prepare for the meeting?
