Subject: RE: Second Sight report - follow up to Friday

Importance: High
What we need in particular, and very urgently, is a breakdown of the 47 cases showing:

1. How many of the SPMs had their contracts terminated?

2. How many of the SPMs were convicted of respectively, fraud, theft and false accounting?
3. In each category, how many of those convicted pled guilty?

4. How many (if any) were prosecuted but found not guilty?

Can you get this to us by 10.30 please?

Hi Rodric

I left a voicemail about the Second Sight report. We are likely to have to make a statement to
Parliament this lunchtime. Jo Swinson's office has urgently requested information about the number
of convictions. Will spoke to you at the end of the meeting on Friday about this, and it would be great
if you could send over your findings as soon as possible.

Alongside the breakdown of conviction types, can you also please let me know in how many of the
cases were there allegations that Horizon was to blame?

Happy to discuss also, am on}

Many thanks
Peter
