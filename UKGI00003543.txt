Hi Claire

In the interests of time, please see attached:
e Proposed short WMS for the POL announcement tomorrow
¢ Draft proposed press lines (in the same document as the WMS)
e® Back-up WMS in case the announcement is delayed

I should emphasise that Hannah has not yet cleared the press lines, so it would be great if you could hold off showing
those to Jo until she has had a chance to comment.

We are still waiting on POL for the letter to Jo and press materials, I will continue to chase.

As I understand you discussed with Richard on Friday, we do not think it very likely that we will need the back up
WMS, but if Jo has a chance to approve it today that would be helpful. (And as an aside, we can consider reusing this
WMS text for next week’s activity around POL if Jo would like to).

Thanks
Laura
