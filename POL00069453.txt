I had a telephone conversation with Mandy Talbot. She has spoken with Claire and
Catherine at the Post Office. They are happy to follow counsel's advice and go for a
December trial purely as a tactic, even though acknowledging that is an unlikely event.
However if the other side seeks to reduce evidence we must preserve our ability to reply on
that.

Secondly, reminding her that at the CMC we had agreed that I would call Rowe Cohen
afterwards on a without prejudice basis and make an offer and comment to the effect that
we were surprised they didn't accept our Part 36 offer. Rowe Cohen have been avoiding my
calls and I have been having to leave voicemail messages for Mr Turner, or being put
straight through to voicemail. I wanted to know if Mandy was happy for me to repeat that
offer at the CMC or words to that affect and she is.

Thereafter updating Richard Morgan on these two points. Also confirming to him that I had
called Rowe Cohen this afternoon and just got put straight through to voicemail and had not
heard back from them on the question of amendments. Richard wants me to bring three
copies of the contract and signature page to the CMC.

Time engaged with Mandy - 6 minutes and thereafter with Richard - 12 minutes
