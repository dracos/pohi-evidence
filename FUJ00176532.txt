Problem statement IRE19 DCs

Oye-

“I Gauntlett, Pau

There was a question as to whether or not FJ have yet issued a problem statement to POL re: IRE19 DCs (in relation to
potential impact on tactical San).

I have spoken to Steve Browell who has confirmed a note was sent to Simon Oldnall and Jeff Smyth 11" Jan 22. I think
John N asked for this info, please share (I don’t propose to share the email itself, suggest they talk internally if they

need / want a copy).
