Subject: I FW: BBC Panorama - Notes from POL meeting

Hi

I need help with the two actions in red below. I assume it should be relatively easy to pull the TFS entries for the 2
bugs (I assume there may be multiple entries).

On pulling info on the bugs may be worth pulling in Gareth as he has already done this analysis and would be able to
pull the info together quickly as needed early next week.

Thoughts?

Hi
Here are the asks from Post Office to support them with Panorama:

e Can Fujitsu provide photographs of the area in Bracknell Mr Rudkin visited

e Can Fujitsu accommodate a visit by Angela Van Den Bogard to this area next week — Post Office to offer
availability

e Would Fujitsu approve a Panorama film crew the opportunity to film in the test area in Bracknell

¢ Provide TFS outputs and supportive documentation for the 2 bugs identified in the Second Sight Report

e Investigate the suggestion there is a 3" bug in the Second Sight Report- Mark Underwood has sent over the
email with the detail

e Fujitsu to soften words as discussed on the statement to be issued to Panorama’s ROR

I will identify owners for the actions above before close of play today.

Graham: Assuming you agree these are the actions can you extract and send to Post Office?
Regards
Pete

Just following on from the PO request to soften our response a bit I have added a few words to our first draft — see

below. Let me know if the account team is happy with it. If so I, or you, can share with Mel and her team.

“In common with other organisations Fujitsu does not comment on the specifics of customer contracts’

Probably a good plan. I have a meeting at 5.30 with Gavin and Rowena to brief so we need to do at 4.00.

I’ve just got off my calls. I can join but by bringing the legal/commercial person we do send a signal which may not be

prudent. However, if you disagree I will dial in

Can we have a call after the call with POL?

Thank you.

The briefing we had today with Panorama went well in terms of giving the opportunity to provide the facts about all
the different allegations. We are having a meeting tomorrow morning with key players here to go through our next
steps.

I think it would be good if I catch up with you by phone after that, if you are around tomorrow, to discuss particularly
those areas of questioning that are more directly about Fujitsu e.g. transparency with Post Office, remote access. As I
said yesterday we’re continuing to bring this back to the facts of the cases, because there is not one example of
Horizon causing losses in them — and that’s what we have done today.

We recorded today’s briefing, with Panorama’s knowledge of course, and I am getting that transcribed — will take a bit
of time as it was a 2 hour meeting.

They asked a question at the end that we will need to speak about. Essentially this was about ‘an issues log’ that they
said FJ must have for Horizon because it would be standard for any system and were asking if Post Office had seen it
etc. We didn’t discuss it - have said we will come back to them on it. I will get the exact wording of the question for
you from the transcript.

But we can speak tomorrow — let me know when you're free.

Many thanks

Mel
