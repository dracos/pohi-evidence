Dear Sajid,

1 am writing to you on behalf of a constituent who wrote to me detailing her situation of
allegedly having run up debts through ‘false accounting’ during her time as a Subpostmistress.

My constituent describes a situation whereby this debt was falsely attributed to her in error
because of problems arising from the Post Office’s ‘Horizon’ operating system.

As you will know this case is not an isolated one and there is a national campaign run by the
Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA) which echoes the concerns of many hundreds of ex-
subpostmasters who feel aggrieved by the actions of the Post Office.

Task therefore if you could clarify the position of the Government on this matter and also ask
what advice and clarification your department would issue to those who find themselves in the
same difficult position as described by my constituent.

Look forward to hearing your reply.

Yours sincerely

GRO
