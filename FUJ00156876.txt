Subject: I Re: CONFIDENTIAL - Second Sight and expert determination

Just spoken with Lesley, she didn't have a firm eta but is going to take a view and get back to us. My guess
would be, she would be happy for us to push back on areas that don't make sense and maybe have a workshop to
go through them.

All,
I have just got off the phone with Roderick from Post Office. It would appear that they are pressing
ahead with wanting the Expert “view”. They appear to have two persons in mind.

I have asked for the Terms of Reference for the Expert (and also the legal opinion from Cartwright King
(this latter one I may not get)). Once I have them I will share and we will need a meeting to discuss what
we do next. Given Lesley’s initial concerns about this process it would be useful to understand where
she is with this and whether she will support us if we push back / amend the terms?

I have also asked for the terms of reference for the Mediation Process.
Kind regards,

Mike

Please find below my summary of the meeting that Helen and I had with Post Office regarding providing
support with respect to the Mediation Process and others arising as a result of the Second Sight report.

Any questions, please give me a call. Otherwise at some stage we will need to discuss how what we
need to do to deliver to their requirements.

Kind regards,

4 POL require Fujitsu to assist this process by
providing the data etc (as per current
Horizon Prosection support processes).
However, it would be of value if we could
provide explanatory reports too (pitched at
the Sub-PMs technical level to explain the

8 POL looking for some means of providing an

MH pointed out concerns he had about how
viable such an approach would be with
respect to past transactions.

We need to remember
this is all about data
integrity and as such I
am of the view that we
remain best placed to
provide the data and
give a context/
explanation as to where
is came from and any
factors affecting it.

POL have/are having
conversations with
Imperial College re the
“academic”.

regarding the use of an
academic /
independent expert but
for her it depends on

proposed ToR for an

SC indicated she may

a call with Counsel on

9 POL flagged that Counsel is concerned
regarding the change of data audit system.
HL and MH explained that the process will
be independently checked throughout the
process and nothing will be done with POL’s
agreement

Note LS stated she did
not have any concerns
regarding this process

Once the paper’s are
completed, Fujitsu to
present them to POL
(including Counsel).
