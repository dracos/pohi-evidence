Annex A
IT&C Transformation Project

Post Office is undertaking a comprehensive information technology and communications transformation
project (“IT&C Transformation Project”). This involves the provision of five main types of IT services
provided by separate service “tower” suppliers (“Service Towers”). Post Office contracts with the
Service Towers directly and the Service Integrator Service Delivery Manager (the ““SISD”) manages the
Service Towers to ensure that Post Office receives effective, stable and operable IT services from its
suppliers.

In addition to the Service Towers, approximately 23 “incumbent suppliers” (“Incumbents”) of IT
services to Post Office will remain. Post Office also has three panels of “framework” suppliers
(“Framework Suppliers”) from whom Post Office can ask to provide services without having to procure
them through a public procurement process. Services provided by the Incumbents will eventually be run
off and replaced by the Service Towers or the Framework Suppliers.

The IT&C Transformation Project structure is set out below. Please use this chart to identify if any of
the services that you are procuring relate to any of the services provided through the IT&C
Transformation Project and may need to be managed by the SISD.
