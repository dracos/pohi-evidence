Title: GLO Related Matters & Project Date: 28 July 2020
Starling
. Mark Underwood: LCG Ben Foat: Group General
Author: : . Sponsor:
Operations Director Counsel

Input Sought: The Board is asked to:

e Approve, in principle, an internal restructure / ring-fencing whereby a new ‘Historical
Matters’ business unit including a historical Group executive within the existing Post
Office Group, reporting into the existing Post Office Board, noting this does not prevent
a new separate entity being formed in due course.

e Approve the development of an implementation plan which is to be brought back to
Board in September.

Previous Governance Oversight

¢ Pre-Meetings with UKGI 10 June & 30 June, and BEIS 30 June 2020.
e PGLO SteerCo 8July 2020.
e Post Office Group Executive Meeting of 15 July 2020.

Executive Summary

1. Although addressing the issues caused as a result of historical practices is important and
necessary for Post Office to reset the relationship with Postmasters; the amount of
Executive and Board time these matters consume restricts the focus required to ensure
Post Office realises its forward looking strategy. The intensity of these matters will also
likely increase over the next 12 - 24 months.

EE Post O° ce bas
advised UKGI, BEIS and HMT that Post Office will not be able to fund the potential financial
exposure associated with these matters. Post Office will need support from Government.
Talks to agree the appropriate mechanism and quantum, have begun and need to continue
regularly to ensure these are not overlooked particularly in the 3 year funding round which
we understand begins formally in September.

3. In terms of managing the matters which give rise to historical issues and liabilities going
forward, Post Office has 3 options:

i. Do Nothing: These matters and the programme teams continue to be reported up
through the existing Post Office Group Executive and the existing Post Office Board.
ii. Internal Re-structure / Ring-fencing: Ar istorical Matters’ Group Executive
is formed as an additional Business Unit the existing Post Office Group,
reporting into the existing Post Office Board.
iii. Separate Legal Entity: a new legal entity is created, outside of the current Post
Office Group, with a new ‘Historical Matters’ Group Executive reporting into a new
Board.

4. The recommendation is for Post Office proceed on the basis of option 2. This option is less
complicated than forming a new legal entity outside of the group and does not prevent a
new separate entity being formed in due course, once some of the current ‘unknowns’
become known. If the Board approve this recommendation, immediate next steps include
funding and resourcing a project team, with support from external legal advisers and
consultants. The first deliverable being an implementation plan for the September Board.

Questions addressed

1. What options exist for Post Office to separate itself from managing historical issues arising
from the GLO and Starling?

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each option, including the associated

timeframes and costs?

What is the recommended approach and why?

What are the risks of not taking action now?

Report
Context

aw

5. This paper and its recommendation has been brought to the Board owing to the following

developments / ongoing matters:

« The recent decision from the CCRC to refer a number of private prosecutions brought
by Post Office to the Court of Appeal.

¢ The Historical Shortfall Scheme; stood up by Post Office in May 2020, to enable current
and former postmasters who were not claimants in the GLO, to make claims for losses
relating to historical shortfalls.

« Post Office’s defence of a claim brought by CWU to establish ‘worker rights’ (“Starling”)
for a subset of postmasters.

6. The GE and Board receive regular briefings on each of the above matters and will be aware
therefore of the significant financial exposure to Post Office, individually and as a collective.
The GE and Board are also therefore aware of the amount of time these matters consume
at Board and GE Meetings. The level of ‘stewardship’ these complicated matters also require
outside of these meetings from members of the GE, particularly in respect of the Group
Chief Executive Officer and Group General Counsel, is significant.

7. Although addressing the issues of the past which gave rise these matters is important and
necessary to reset and evolve the relationship with Postmasters, the CEO and the rest of
the GE need to be able to focus on delivering a self-sustaining commercial future for the
company.

Options

8. Post Office, UKGI, BEIS and HMT recognise that although Post Office has managed the
financial costs of GLO and Starling related matters to date (including the £58m settlement
figure agreed in December 2019 with the GLO claimants), should any of the potential
financial exposure associated with these matters crystallise, Post Office will need support
from Government.

9. Talks to agree the appropriate mechanism and quantum, should begin and continue
regularly to ensure these are not overlooked in the 3 year funding round which we
understand begins formally in September. Post Office should seek two distinct ‘pots’ of
funding; network funding and funding to manage and provide for the potential liabilities
attached to these matters.

10. In terms of the management of these matters going forward, broadly speaking Post Office
has 3 options:

i. Do Nothing: These matters and the programme teams continue to be managed and

reported up through the existing Post Office Group Executive and the existing Post Office
Board,

ii. Internal Re-structure / Ring-fencing: A new ‘Historical Matters’ Group Executive is
formed as an additional Business Unit within the existing Post Office Group, reporting
into the existing Post Office Board. A new executive director within that executive
committee would be appointed to have accountability for managing this programme of
work.

iii. Separate Legal Entity: a new legal entity is created, which sits outside of the current
Post Office Group, with a new ‘Historical Matters’ Group Executive reporting into a new
Board. The current programme teams move into this new separate legal entity.

12. The level of cost, complexity and disruption increases as you move from option 1 to option
3. This is to be balanced against the level of genuine separation achieved. ‘Doing nothing’
risks Post Office being unable to realise its forward looking strategy and failing to become
a self-sufficient, commercially sustainable organisation - particularly as the workload and
subsequent required level of ‘stewardship’ from the Group Executive and Board will likely
increase over the next 12-24 months.

13. Given the current unknowns® and the associated cost, complexity and timeframes
associated with the remaining options - the recommendation is that Post Office proceed
on the basis of option 2 - A new ‘Historical Matters’ Group Executive is formed as an
additional Business Unit within the existing Post Office Group, reporting into the existing
Post Office Board.

Next Steps

14, Ifthe Board approve the recommendation, a project team will be resourced and stoad up,
supported by external legal advisers and a consultancy firm. The immediate deliverable,
for the September Board, will be a comprehensive implementation timeline and plan which
will include the considerations set out in the earlier table. This requires funding.

15. Aletter should be sent to UKGI and BEIS setting out the concept and implementation plan.

16. KPMG and Linklaters are well placed to support Post Office with delivery owing to their
involvement on Project Legal Entity Optimisation (LEO). Their support is required owing
to a lack of bandwidth and experience in executing these types of matters within Post
Office. KPMG would be a non-compliant direct award and procurement risk exception
notice will be included within the separate Procurement Board Paper.

7@.g. the merits of claims brought through the historical Shortfall Scheme; the number of referrais which will be made to the
Court of Appeal; whether any historical convictions will be overturned an ims for malicious prosecution brought; whether the
October Starling Tribunal will proceed in October and whether the claimants will actually establish worker status.
