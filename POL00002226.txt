Dear Stewart

Re Branch Discrepancies at Wardles Lane Post Office

You may have been aware of 2 unexplained discrepancies that have
impacted your branch.

I can confirm that losses totalling 51p declared at both TP9 in 2011/12
and 2012/13 were not proper to your branch. This problem was created
by a specific set of circumstances dating back to actual losses you
declared in 2010 (TP8).

In brief the stock unit that declared the relevant discrepancy was deleted
on or before 10" December 2010. The related Local Suspense entry
should also have been removed, but this did not happen.

The impact of this was that the loss declaration of 2010 was picked up
again at the beginning of TP9 the next year in Horizon. At the end of
TP9 the branch was forced to clear this along with current discrepancies.
The Local Suspense ledger in the Post Office Finance System was
impacted in the same way.

This scenario was then repeated at the same point the next year.

Both TP9 discrepancies recorded at your branch were of course assigned
to nominee and resolved under standard monthly settlement. Post Office
Ltd will add £1.02 credit to your next statement and will be included in
the next settlement made.

Changes to Horizon in 2011 prevented this problem for stock units
deleted after mid-December 2010, and the old Local Suspense entry has
now been removed from the system.

I do apologise for this problem being allowed to occur and impacting
your branch. I am aware these were only small amounts but felt it was
only fair to alert you to the problem and correct our settlement.

Yours sincerely
