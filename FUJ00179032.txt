‘Deloittes have now started to ask for detailed information on the audit system and Horizon as opposed to HNGX. We
have provided documentation and have no reason to assume that the system did not operate as described. If Post
Office want Delloites to continue with this activity this would be a whole new stream of work and we would estimate
it would cost double that spent on the current audit as we don’t have any system on which we could investigate any
challenges put to us and therefore would have to spend significant time and effort to research the detail on how the
Riposte system stored data. We feel it would be impractical to contemplate recreating a Riposte based system after
such a long time and so any responses to Deloittes would be based on our analysis of logs and so would represent a
theoretical understanding of what happened which could not be tested.

Hopefully we can meet early next week to understand Post Offices’ intentions.

Regards etc
