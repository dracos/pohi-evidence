I am the above named person and I give this statement of my own free will. I am

employed as the Assistant Manager of Jesmond Post Office, St Georges Terrace, Newcastle
Upon Tyne, NE2 2SY. I have been employed there since 17" April 2008, initially part time
as a counter assistant, working Thursday 08:45 to 17:30 hours, Friday 08:45 to 17:30
hours and Saturday 08:45 to 13:15 hours. The opening times for the Post Office are
09:00 to 17:30 hours Monday to Friday, 09:00 to 13:00 hours Saturday. On Thursday
18" September 2008 I was asked to take over as temporary Sub Postmistress after Sunil
Khanna, Sub Postmaster was suspended after a large shortage aws found at audit.
Although Sunil was the Sub Postmaster, he never took any part in the running of the Post
Office. He employed Peter Holmes as the Manager to run the office. Prior to 18°
September 2008 my responsibilities were to serve the customers. We operated a shared
stock unit AA in the office and each morning when I arrived, Peter Holmes would either be
putting cash and stock in the drawer at my counter position or it would already be there. I
never counted the money to check what was there as it was a shared stock unit. If I

required more money throughout the day I would ask Peter for it and he would take it

from the safe. At three O'clock on Thursday & Friday I would count the Scottish and spoilt
notes, balance them and get someone to check them. I would then check the cash in my
drawer. If there was a lot I would bundle them into £1,000's and hand them to Doreen
Corcoran. I never opened the Post Office in the morning or closed it at night. I never took
the Post Office keys at any time. My User Id for Horizon is TCROO1 and my password is
not known to anyone. I do not know anyone else’s password. I was not aware of any
problems with the Horizon system when Peter was employed. The Branch trading
Statement was completed at the period end, however, I had no involvement in preparing it
as I didn't work on a Wednesday. Although I worked on a Wednesday when someone was
on holiday, however I still didn’t take part in the balance. I wasn’t made aware if the
balance was over and short. I did ask Peter on a Thursday occasionally and he said it was
right or something along those lines. On occasion I would enter the cash figures from the
cash sheet onto Horizon. When I did so I never a variance check and it was always entered
under 06. On Thursday 18" September 2008 the audit team were in the office when I
arrived. Sunil met me in the medicentre where the Post Office is and told me they were in
and to wait in the tea room. Later on Sunil said they didn’t know how long they would be
in and told me to go home. Sunil contacted me later and asked if I would take over the
Post Office as he had been suspended. He also told me there was a £46,000 shortage and
Peter had also been suspended. I agreed and came back to the office. I asked the auditor
why there was a £46,000 shortage and he said there was a second cash declaration that I
later found out was 09. I was not aware that cash declaration 09 existed. I didn’t steal the

money.
