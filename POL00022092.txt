Thanks. I attach the note setting out our thoughts on what a report into Horizon would entail.

We will aim to get you an outline of our thinking to date on the options work as early as possible on Monday.
Kind regards

Jonathan

Jonathan,
Post our conference call I think the plan remains as we discussed on the phone.

e On the assurance work you are sending your note through today.

¢ On the options work we will look to get a couple of hours in the diary to discuss options — probably on
Tuesday. To support that work it would be good if you can set out where your thinking has got to on the
potential options and their viability. It would be good to have that paper as early as possible in Monday.

e — Iwill ask Chris’ office to set up the meeting.

Thanks

David
