What is Horizon?

POL's core trading platform that processes ca.7m transactions daily and £66bn of value annually.
Built in the late 1990s and still operated by Fujitsu, it allows Branches to serve customers, it provides
Branch accounting and cash management functionality, it acts as the foundation for most other back-
office processes, and it serves as the communication tool between POL and its network

SPM Background

POL00460594
POL00460594

The Case For Change

Horizon has been in place for over three decades and it has not kept pace with technology or POL's
business needs. Main challenges:

Postmaster Core processes are outdated and cause inefficiency / friction / errors in Branch operations. Modernising is
Impact mostly impossible as processes are embedded deep in Horizon's architecture

Commercial Modifying existing products or adding new ones takes considerable time and is costly (e.g. PUDO). This
Impact severely impairs POL's ability to develop and launch new commercial partnerships.

DECC R US Horizon is ‘one-size-fits-all meaning format innovation or integration with Strategic Partners is not possible (e.g
Teen teri aa Drop & Collect, the first version of NBIT, would not have been possible with Horizon)
un’ and Very costly to run (ca. £45m p.a. in FY24/25, likely approaching ca.£65m-£70m in FY27/28) and change, given itis a
TETREMCS HEE dated system and the dependence on Fuljtsu. NBIT is expected to be less costly to run
End of Lift Datacentre infrastructure in Belfast is past its end of Ife and will consume significant investment to keep operating until
ahr ‘we can exit from Horizon. In-branch hardware is also at end of life and needs replacement

Currently only Fujitsu can operate Horizon and they have been actively seeking to exit, with their Board blocking
temporary extensions. Alternative operating structures are higher cost and higher risk

POL00460594
POL00460594

Programme
Vision

Replace Horizon
with a robust,
resilient and fit-for-

purpose platform that...

Improves the efficiency and usability
of Horizon processes wherever
possible;

Better meets the needs of
Postmasters and strategic partners;

Has a lower cost to operate;

Is cheaper, quicker and easier to
change;

Provides the platform that will
enable Post Office's future
retail transformation.

POL00460594
POL00460594

Scope
Principles

$

+.

All products sold and serviced on Horizon will be replicated on
NBIT to avoid impact to Postmaster remuneration.

The product scope baseline is 1 April 2024 — Horizon
changes after this date will be considered as a Change Request.

Products offered to customers at the counter (NBIT) or on
a separate mobile platform.

3 Where delivery costs of products outweigh their economic value,
¥ these will be reviewed by the GE.
Development sequence of products based on live
branch transaction volumes and the % complete of
development.

© _NBIT will be rolled out to POL’s entire branch network.

POL00460594
POL00460594

What Are Our Key Delivery Principles

Designed with Postmasters, for Postmasters: Postmaster-facing products will
be designed and tested with Postmasters, drawing on the extensive feedback
already provided

Incremental development: incremental technology development and rollout as
opposed to “Big Bang”

Dual run for Post Office, one system for Postmasters: The new system will
run live in parallel with Horizon for a short period of time to de-risk the transition.

Business continuity and minimal disruption to Postmasters : SPMP will ensure
a smooth transition during migration away from Horizon. It will aim to migrate a
branch with minimal disruption to ongoing business activity with access to training
before and during migration.

What types of Testing do we do on NBIT?

f”A

F

01 Testing in Engineering Squads

Detects may manifest from errors in code ina spectic component or issues wth component integration during very early development. Our
Engineering Squads test their code as they develop it (Unt Testing") and our Quality Engineers in each Squad execute early functional
and non-functional testing on the area of the NBIT solution they are bulding

02 Release Functional Testing

‘Once our Squads have completed development and testing oftheir components and the solution i uly integrated, our End-to End and
Business Verification test teams execute functional testing of NBIT. Our teams are made up of skiled Testing professionals and
experienced BSC and Branch Reconciliation staf. Testing is conducted both on simulators and real NBIT branch hardware. Testing,
encompasses customer and colleague business scenario testing as well as end-to-end POL Finance and Reconciliation testing

03 Release Non-Functional Testing

(Our Release Non-Functonal Test team also conduct testing ofthe fully integrated solution. Their testing is focused on things like Performance
Testing — how responsive the solution is for colleagues and customers, Operational Acceptance Testing — how the solution can be operated,
monitored and maintained once lve, and Security Testing fo make sure the solution meets POL's securty standards

04 User Acceptance Testing

In User Acceptance Testing, the NBIT programme works with Branch Managers and Postmasters from the wider POL business

to test that the soltion meets requirements and that they can delver on thelr responsiblties to thelr customers and the business using the
solution

05 Live Testing in a Controlled Environment

Despite thorough testing and qualty assurance measures, some defects may go undetected unl the software is used in eal-world scenario.
Curteams carry out a scope of Live Testing (onthe ive network but notin branch) once the software fs deployed to production to make sure
key business process and integrations to our third-party partners work as expected

Good morning and thank you all for joining us.

Today we wanted to get you all together to show you how we have responded to your feedback and looked at how we can
improve the way we work together as ONE TEAM

We are all working on what is one of the biggest technology transformation projects in the UK right now

So, it is vital that we have all the building blocks in place to give us the best foundations to build from as we head towards
rollout of the new system

But why make changes now?

Well, we have listened and responded to your feedback from the Excel Away days and we have used this to reshape how we
work.

We are doing this now as it is the right time, the right time for us to simplify our work so we can increase the quality and the
speed of the good work we are doing and put ourselves in the best position to succeed.
