   on the basis that, legal professional privilege in the matters addressed this witness

   statement has been waived by my original client, Post Office Limited ("POL").




4. A number of the questions posed in the Request appear to me potentially to fall

   outside the scope of the Inquiry and the List of Issues produced within the Inquiry.

   I have, nevertheless, attempted to answer all the questions, but those answers are

   produced without prejudice to all lawful objections, which are expressly preserved

   should it become necessary or appropriate to make them.

5. I further note that some of the information sought should be contained in primary

   documents. In particular, I seem to recall that there were transcripts of the hearings

   in the matter upon which the Request is primarily focused, and they should provide

   a definitive record if they are still available. I apologise if my hazy recollection of

   events differs from the definitive record contained in the transcripts: if it has

   occurred, any such divergence is unintentional and is occasioned by an imperfect

   memory of the events in question.

6. In preparing this witness statement I was asked in the Request to consider a

   number of documents, most of which I do not remember or did not see at the time.

   I have listed in Schedule I to this witness statement the Unique Reference Number

   ("the URN") of the documents provided to me so that a reader of this statement is

   informed of the documents considered and the evidence that I can offer on the

   basis of the information contained in those documents. Where the URN in the

   Schedule is in bold, the reference is to a document that also appears in the text

   below.

7. Having taken science "A" levels in 1981, 1 took a year off before starting University.

   I started a Physics Degree at Oxford University in 1982 but failed Physics Mods in

   1983.   I then did a 2 year law degree (LL.B) at the University of Buckingham,

   graduating with a 2:1 in 1985, and an LL.M at Cambridge University, graduating

   with a 2:1 in 1987.

8. 1 did my first 6 months of pupillage with Charles Flint KC and Ian Mill KC at the

   Chambers of Colin Ross-Munro at 2 Hare Court, and my second 6 months of

   pupillage with Catherine Newman KC at the Chambers of B.VVH Christie at 13 Old

   Square, one of the forerunner sets that went on to merge to form Maitland

   Chambers, and I have been a tenant in those, or the successor, Chambers since

   completion of my pupillage in 1989.

9. My practice has revolved around chancery, commercial and insolvency law, with

   an increasing focus on cross-border issues and freezing injunctions and litigation

   and arbitration both domestically and internationally. I have appeared in a number

   of jurisdictions overseas.

10. 1 have some limited knowledge of computers, computer networks and their

   operation, developed through personal interest, a temporary job prior to joining the

   Bar and from certain matters in which I have been instructed, including one matter

   concerning computer hacking that was resolved prior to 2006..

11.According to a copy of a fee line retained on Chambers' diary system, I was

   instructed by Bond Pearce on behalf of POL at the end of November 2005 and

   returned the trial bundles and most associated papers around the end of January

   2007, and the last of my papers on the matter to Bond Pearce at the end of May

   2008.

12. Along with old electronic files relating to other cases, those relating to this case

   were deleted by me sometime between 2015 and 2017.

"3. In the circumstances I have retained no papers and have no access to historic

   electronic documents other than very limited legacy information relating to billing

   arid diary entries, and accordingly save to the extent that specific documents ha✓e

   been drawn to my attention in the Request this statement is prepared to the best

   of my recollection of events taking place more than 15 years ago and without the

   benefit of the surrounding documents.

14. So far as I can recall, the case against Lee Castleton ("the Case") was the first

   occasion on which I was instructed on behalf of POL or any of the Post Office

   companies. I was instructed after the proceedings had already been ongoing for

   some time.

15. Having refreshed my memory from legacy records on the Chambers system, I can

   see that I had previously been instructed by Tom Beezer of Bond Pearce for an

   unrelated lay client before I was instructed on the Case. I seem to think I was

   instructed on the Case because of my relationship with Tom Beezer, developed

   whilst acting for the previous client.

16. The partner at Bond Pearce responsible for instructing me was Tom Beezer and

   his assistant was Stephen Gilley. There may have been other lawyers (whose

   names would presumably appear on the Bond Pearce documentation), but I cannot

   remember anyone else.

17. 1 do not now recall any specific or general instructions from POL in relation to Mr

   Castieton's case that any shortfall was entirely the fault of problems with the

   Horizon IT system, but my instructions can, no doubt, be ascertained by recovering

   from my solicitors a set of the Instructions sent to me. I was obviously aware it was

   Mr Castleton's case that the losses were caused by a problem with the Horizon IT

   system, and I think I would have known that from reading the Brief [POL00073008]

   from my Instructing Solicitors and the statements of case. I can't remember how

   or when I came to know about it, but I did seem to know that there were other cases

   where sub-postmasters were saying that there were problems with Horizon. I do

   not recall anyone ever identifying in any detail what the problems were or how they

   allegedly caused any losses.

18. Beyond being told that no-one had identified any problems with the Horizon system

   at Mr Castleton's branch, I do not independently recall being provided with any

   information about any investigations conducted by the Post Office or Fujitsu

   beyond that which was mentioned in the Brief and which subsequently appeared

   in the witness statements tendered on behalf of POL.

10. I was initially instructed after the first round of pleadings had closed at a time when

   Mr Castleton had entered a judgment in default on his counterclaim. I was asked

   to assist on an application to set that judgment aside, but that application was

   compromised before a hearing.

20. The claim against Mr Castleton was worth around £25,000, yet the costs and court

   time of bringing the claim to trial appeared to me to be out of proportion to the sum

   in issue. This was even more the case if any trial ultimately involved trying to

   explain the workings of a computer system where no particular fault was alleged

                                                                                   WITNO8570100




   beyond a generalised allegation that the system was somehow generating

   discrepancies.

21. POL sought to protect itself in costs by making an offer under Part 36 of the Civil

   Procedure Rules and an attempt was made to have the case moved to a tribunal

   that was more appropriate for a trial of this value,

22. It seemed obvious to me that trying to prove forensically that an entire computer

   network operated properly was going to be a very difficult, if not impossible,

   exercise, and it also seemed that Mr Castleton had not identified any mechanism

   by which errors were allegedly being generated. The lack of any reason identified

   by Mr Castleton, or indeed anyone else, for any alleged errors meant that there

   was uncertainty as to whether anything could ever be proved for or against the

   accuracy of the Horizon system.

23. 1 have been asked to look at the following documents:

      a. A letter from Bond Pearce to my clerk dated 29 November 2005

           [P0L00070446];

      b. the Brief to represent POL at a CIVIC before Master Turner dated 29

           November 2005 [POL00073008];

       i.   an email from         Beezer to Mandy Talbot dated 21 August 200E




                            Tom
            [POL00071081]; and

       j.   an email dated 24 August 2006 [POL00071040].



24. Looking at the various emails to which my attention has been directed, whilst I have

   virtually no recollection of the events set out, it looks like I advised that all the

   hardware from the branch should be identified and secured and both parties should

   have their appointed experts examine whatever needed to be examined so that

   they could work out if anything was going wrong. I am not sure whether or not that

   ever happened, but I seem to recall (although I am by no means sure) that I was

   told there was some progress in securing both hardware and historic versions of

   software.

25. Nevertheless, at a very high level, the issue in the Case was whether there was a

   discrepancy of around £25,000 between () the cash and stock Mr Castleton held

   at the end of the period when taken together with cash sent back to the Post Office

   and all other receipts received by the Post Office from the branch and (ii) the cash

   and stock that Mr Castleton was given at the start together with the cash and stock

   that he received whilst trading.     If those cash and stock numbers could be

   established by reference to primary documents; then it was possible to prove what

   the correct figure for the closing balance should be forensically without reference

   to the Horizon system, and hence whether there was a real, as opposed to illusory,

   discrepancy.

26. 1 think some of the primary documentation prepared by Mr Castleton must have

   been provided to me at some point early on and I noticed that he signed off on daily

   and/or weekly figures (I cannot remember exactly what documentation was
                                           7
                                                                                         WITNO8570100
                                                                                      WITNO8570100




   produced, I only have some recollection that there was a body of accounting

   documentation, and there were some manuscript documents). It therefore seemed

   to me that the deficiency could be proved simply by adding up all the manuscript

   figures produced, and all the calculations signed off, by Mr Gastleton and without

   reference to any records produced only by a computer.

27, Whilst thinking about that, and I can't remember why I knew it (perhaps another

   case on receivership accounts), but I recalled that there was a line of authorities in

   relation to accounts stated and settled accounts, When I researched that line of

   authorities, I realised that there was authority for the argument that if Mr Castleton

   was tendering his own figures to POL, he was vouching their accuracy. I therefore

   advised that we should re-align our pleaded case to take this point and we should

   try to establish the true trading position by reference to Mr Castleton's own

   documents (by which I mean documents produced and/or verified by Mr Castleton,

   rather than print outs from Horizon).

28. 1 seem to recall that this resulted in all the daily and weekly figures produced by Mr

   Castleton being collated and put in the trial bundle. My recollection now is that

   when one went through the figures produced or verified by Mr Castleton, without

   any reference to any unverified Horizon print outs, those showed that there was a

   discrepancy of around £25,000 as was claimed. If that was correct then either

   there was a discrepancy, or the manuscript figures produced by Mr Castleton were

   inaccurate, and I don't recall him ever saying that they were wrong. I should say

   that this is what I think now, and I also think it is what I thought at the time, but I

   cannot be sure. It is certainly how I recall going about preparation for the trial and

   spending days and days cross-referencing manuscript daily and weekly trading

   records to typed pieces of paper so that I could take the witnesses and the Judge

   through the figures at trial if necessary.

29. 1 don't remember, but I see from ernails, that I did see draft statements and made

   suggestions on them. I can't remember what those suggestions were. I must also

   have asked for more documents, for relevant hardware to be preserved, and for

   any backup copies of the software as it existed at the relevant times to be

   preserved. I think I also recognised in my own mind, and I think I told my Instructing

   Solicitors, that trying to recreate an entire hardware and software system to

   replicate what was in place at the time of the relevant events would probably be

   extremely difficult, if not impossible, and that I didn't see how I could prove that

   there were actual losses by reference simply to what a computer print-out said.

   Instead, I needed physical records of cash and stock in, cash and stock out, and a

   calculation at the end of the day for what should be left after it had all been taken

   into account, If that was done, then it seemed to me that the operation of the

   Horizon system was irrelevant.

30. 1 do not recall ever formally advising on the merits, although I did, I think, express

   an opinion, or opinions, close to trial that the loss could be proved. I do not recall

   ever being asked formally to advise on the evidence, although I did review the

   witness statements from both sides, along with all the material in the trial bundles.

   I do not recall ever being asked to advise on disclosure generally, nor on any

   specific issues, but then again I do not really remember much at all about what

   happened at that time.

31. 1 did advise on strategy (as outlined above) and in the course of the trial itself I

   think there was at least one discussion, and probably more, when I discussed with

   solicitors and POL whether it was necessary to call as a witness anyone from

   Fujitsu or the Post Office Horizon Team. My dim recollection is that we agreed that

   it probably was not necessary to call anyone from those groups but that it was more

   transparent if they were at least offered for cross-examination, and I think that is

   what happened.

32. 1 have read a copy of the email at IPOL0007I081] and the third paragraph from

   the bottom of the final page of the attendance note dated 18 August 2006 at

   [POL0007274.1]. I cannot now recall why I might have been raising a point about

   the integrity of the Fujitsu product generally.

33. I do remember spending time thinking about how to prove the claim and how one

   would go about proving that the Horizon system was producing the correct figures.

   I do not remember when I spent that time, but I think it must have been before the

   conference on 18 August 2006.        It struck me that one would need to have a

   complete understanding of the network and how the relevant nodes operated when

   running the software that had been used at the time Mr Castleton was in post. I

   think I thought that even if the network could be reconstituted, I could not prove

   that it was impervious to external modifications (by which I mean hacking,

   unauthorized alteration, etc). I was generally concerned that if I was going to have

   to prove the case by reference to Horizon logs, I wanted to know whether there

  were possible ways that the system could be manipulated and I wanted to

   understand whether there was a context in which any other, and if so how many,

   incidents had been reported. I don't recall ever being told that there were any

   incidents or weaknesses and the issue seemed to fall away in any event when the

   pleading was amended to rely on Mr Castleton's own accounts. I therefore never

  did get instructed on the detailed operation or workings of Horizon.

34. 1 have no recollection of any wider concerns by POL about the Horizon System

   being mentioned to me, nor do I remember any occasion when settlement was

   suggested on the basis of any such (unexpressed) concerns.           I sought to

   encourage POL to settle with Mr Castleton simply because the value ofthe claim

   was small in comparison to the costs that would be incurred and not because I was

   aware of any concerns about the Horizon System. As I hope is clear, the operation

   of the Horizon System appeared to me to be entirely divorced from the merits of

   the claim against Mr Castleton when based on his own records of account.

35. I have been asked to look at the following documents:

      a. Claimant's Statement of Claim dated 25 May 2005 [LCAS0000859];

      b. the undated Amended Statement of Claim [LCAS0000811];

   with my instructions, confirming with my Instructing Solicitors the client's approval

   to my suggested approach and that the claim as it was to be amended reflected

   the way they wanted the case to be advanced, and then I would have set about

   making the amendments. I do not recall receiving any instructions that the claim

   should or should not be run in any particular way other than in accordance with the

   advice that I gave.

      k. an attendance note dated 7 November 2006 [POL00072675].

38. 1 have no direct recollection of any involvement with production of witness

   statements in this case. The evidence that I now set out is based entirely on the

   documents to which I have been referred in the Request. It looks as though I

   received draft witness statements and commented or suggested that further

     questions be asked of the witnesses, and that would be how I would usually have

     worked in relation to witness statements. I notice that in some of the email chains

     there were attachments where I had added comments and questions, but those



     about what I might have been focusing upon.

     include me amongst the recipients. Since I did not apparently see them at the time,

     I cannot really give any evidence in relation to them.

40. 1 have checked my Chambers' diary and can see that I had a long conference on

     11 September 2006, and that correlates with the email correspondence and a Bond

     Pearce attendance note that suggests that I met witnesses on that occasion for

     them to explain their witness evidence to me.

41. In reviewing the witness statements, I suspect, although I cannot now recall, that I

     would have been wanting to check that each and every step of the process of

     delivering and receiving stock and payments was proved.          I cannot, however;

     remember now anything at all about the details.

42. 1 have no recollection of Ken Crawley or the matters being discussed in Stephen

     Dilley's email at [POL00069601]. I cannot give any evidence about what Mr Dilley

     was thinking other that what is reflected on the face of that email.

43. 1 thought it was difficult to prove a loss only by reference to the Horizon IT System

     because in oral argument at trial I would be able to do no more than point to a

     computer print out and say that the print out showed that there was a loss. To my

     mind that did not prove a loss, it only proved what the sum of the figures produced

     by a machine showed when a calculation was undertaken and what figure was

     produced as a result of that calculation.

                                                                                         WITNO8570100




44 In order formally to prove a loss, I wanted to be able to deploy the best primary

    evidence of what had been received at the branch, what had been received from

    the branch, and what remained at the branch, and then show that there was a

    difference between the totals.

45. Given that there were no photographs or videos to prove transactions, the next

    best thing was the physical records produced or verified by Mr Castleton himself

    showing receipts and payments, the stock and cash levels and the balance each

    day (I think) and each week. Based on the various legal authorities cited at trial,

    those records were at least probative; and probably determinative, as against Mr

    Castleton.'

46. That was the approach that was ultimately adopted in deploying POL's case, and

    it is reflected in my skeleton argument for the trial at [POL000 9911] and was

    ultimately accepted by the Judge in his Judgment of 22 January 2007 ("the

    Judgment"). As I recall it, it was also the approach I was advocating in August

    2006.

47 1 did not consider any legal argument on the burden of proof that the sub-

    postmasters were required to sign off on, or balance, the accounts in order to

    continue trading. However, I do not recall that this was raised as a defence by Mr

    Castleton and at this point in time I do not even know if that was the case as a

    matter of contract between POL and Mr Castleton, I seem to recall that at no point

    did Mr Castleton ever suggest or accept in cross-examination that he was



d
  In the event that they were challenged, then the amended relief sought in the
Amended Particulars of Claim included the taking of a formal account which would,
had it been necessary, have resulted in a judicial determination of any balance due at
the conclusion of a trial of all entries, line by line, in a formal account that Mr Castleton
would have been obliged to produce.

   producing and signing off false statements of account, whether voluntarily or

   because he was somehow obliged to do so.             Mr Castleton's position on the

   accuracy of his own figures is reflected in the last sentence of paragraph 11 of the

   Judgment where the Judge observes that Mr Castleton's own figures actually

   correspond with those produced by the Horizon system.

48.To the best of my recollection, which is extremely hazy; I think I thought that it was

   always possible for someone to alter the data recorded on any unsecured

   electronic device, although I thought it was also then possible that there might be

   some electronic data showing when and how the change occurred. I think that

   understanding was from personal knowledge and experience rather than

   something that I was told by POI...

49. 1 have absolutely no idea why or by whom the Castleton case was considered a

   test case — although I note that Mandy Talbot apparently said it had "almost become

   a test case in spite of itself' on page 5 of the attendance note of the con on 11

   September 2006 at [POL00069622]. As far as I was concerned, it was a single

   case to be decided on its own facts, as with every other case. I did not adjust the

   issues to run it as a "test case", nor was I asked to run it as a test case for anything

   (I was only ever instructed to bring a claim to recover amounts owing). The Case

   was not presented to the Court as a test case, and in my view the Judgment does

   not read as if the judge treated it as a "test case" of anything.

50. After all these years my recollection of what was being discussed on pages 4 and

   5 of the note at [P0L00069622] is no more than impressionistic. That impression

   was that there had been one or two occasions when something catastrophic had

   happened and al l data had been lost, that there were 3 or 4 sub-postmasters who

   had complained about a problem but there did not seem to be anything in their
                                           15

                                                                                        WITNO8570100




   complaints, and that there was nothing to suggest that there were any Horizon

   issues at Mr Castleton's branch.       I did not get the impression that errors with

   Horizon were the cause of any problems. In any event, my case strategy was

   independent of any reliance on records from the Horizon system that had not been

   personally vouched by Mr Castleton.

51. l have looked at an email dated 28 September 2006 [POL00069537] but have no

   recollection of what was being discussed. Reconstructing the position now in my

   mind, I suspect what was going on was that there was no single witness who could

   say, from their own knowledge, that there was a loss of Lx, and that the figure for

   the loss could only be arrived at by getting a number of different bits of evidence

   from different people and then submitting to the Court that the consequence of the

   totality of that evidence was that the loss was proved.

52. 1 have no idea what the tactical position of POL was in this litigation or what

   reasoning was behind it. I advised explicitly that the costs were going to be out of

   all proportion to the amount at stake, but I continued to be instructed to progress

   the matter to trial. I think I even advised that a drop hands settlement should be

   attempted, but that does not seem to have been taken up. I do not recall ever

   asking why POL was pursuing the Case nor do I recall ever being told: I had given

   what I considered to be best advice and was instructed to continue to prepare a

   case for trial where that case apparently had merit: in the circumstances I was in

   no position to refuse my instructions. When in late October it appeared that Mr

   Castleton might apply for an adjournment because his case appeared not to be

   ready for trial, I advised that we should try to hold the trial date and I think that was

   because if there was an adjournment that would simply increase the already

   disproportionate costs and make the risk/reward ratio even worse..

53. 1 have lcoked at [POL00069450] and the reference to ". ..brinkmanship and trial

   etc etc", however, I cannot remember what the reference to brinkmanship was

   actually about or indeed whether that was Mr Dilley's description of the approach

   or a phrase I had used, but I think it may have been that Mr Castleton had been

   making generalised allegations about everything being the fault of Horizon but

   never identifying what specifically was wrong. I think there may also have been a

   suggestion that Mr Castleton hoped to get an expert to support his position, but

   nothing had happened. In the meantime, as I have already said above, substantial

   costs were being incurred, and they would only increase the longer a trial was

   delayed. Obviously, POL wanted an opportunity to consider and answer any expert

   evidence from Mr Castleton, but unless and until a trial was imminent, it did not

   appear that that aspect of his case would ever be focused upon. The intention was

   therefore either to have a trial in December 2006 on the evidence as it stood, or to

   seek an adjournment if, but only if, Mr Castleton finally clarified his case. This all

   seems to be borne out by what is recorded as having been said by me on page 2

   of the attendance note of the hearing before Master Turner at [POL00072523].

54. In relation to the email from        Stephen Dilley dated 31 October 2006

   [POL00069404], I have no recollection of the conversation, circumstances or

   issues described in it. I have also read the Second Witness Statement of Gregory

   Booth at [LCAS0000471] and note that it clearly identifies the facts in relation to

   his problem with Horizon. Or the basis of this statement, I think I would have

   thought that the matter was fairly disclosed and I would not have thought it

   impacted on the case against Mr Castleton as proof of the loss was to be based

   upon his own signed documentation.

55. After this length of time I simply cannot remember what expert evidence was

    obtained and what expert evidence was disclosed by Mr Castleton to POL. I would

    assume that written records were m aintained by my Instructing Solicitors and they

    might be able to answer this question, but I am unable to assist.

56. 1 do not recall Mr Castleton relying on any expert evidence at trial, but, again, a

    review of the transcript of the hearing would confirm the position one way or the

    other. I note that no mention is made in the Judgment of expert evidence being

   adduced.

57. 1 have a vague recollection of enquiries being made of experts. So far as I can

    recall, the evidence was sought because it would assist in understanding the

   strengths and weaknesses of POL`s case, and it would be necessary to address

   any expert evidence adduced by Mr Castleton. However, to the best of my current

   recollection, Mr Castleton never served any expert evidence and accordingly no

   expert evidence in answer was needed. I cannot now recall whether any and if so

   what expert evidence was finalised or served by POL for use at trial: again, this is

   a point that can be clarified by reference to any documents retained by my

   Instructing     Solicitors   and   any   transcripts of    the   hearing.      From    the

   contemporaneous documents provided to me it appears that no expert evidence

   was ever finalised for POL, but I cannot help with any answer as I have no actual

   recollection.

58. At this point in time I have no recollection at all of the `"£.8,500" point referred to in

   an attendance note dated 1 December 2006 [POLO0069871], even after refreshing

   my recollection by looking at the documents identified in the Request. As an overall

   recollection of the trial, my impression is that after a lot of work going through the

   witness statements and all the documents in the trial bundles I was able to

   understand and explain each and every entry and prove the total deficiency.

   However, at this point in time I simply cannot remember a specific line entry or how

   it was addressed.

59. 1 have been referred to POL`s note of the trial prepared by Thomas Bourne

  [LCAS0000444] and have been asked to comment on whether POL continued to

   rely on John Jones evidence, in particular paragraph 12 of his second witness

   statement [LCA 0000113] notwithstanding paragraphs 2.2.1(e) and 7.1,5 of the

   draft BDO report of 29 November 2006 at [P L00069955]. I have no recollection

  of the evidence of John Jones and paragraph 12 of his second witness statement

  to which I am referred does not appear to address issues that correspond with

  those appearing in paragraphs 2.2.1(e) and 7.1.5 of the draft BDO Report of 29

   November 2006 [P L00069955] (indeed so far as I can see there is no paragraph

  2.2.1(e) in that report). I also have no recollection of the detail of the draft BDO

   Report, nor do I have any recollection of even seeing it at the time. Nevertheless.

   I can see from the note of the trial at [LCAS0000444] from page 72 that John Jones

  was sworn and proved his statements with certain corrections, and on page 73 1

  apparently took him to the £3,533.30 figure (although I have no recollection of the

  events recorded). That record indicates that POL did continue to rely on the

  evidence of John Jones, and Mr Jones confirmed that his evidence was true. As

  for disclosure or reliance on the draft report at trial, as I have already said, I do not

  remember even seeing it and I cannot now recall any directions for expert evidence

  to be adduced. However, as a general observation, my understanding at the time

  would have been that there was no obligation in civil litigation to disclose draft

  witness or expert statements, nor was there an obligation to disclose finalised

  expert statements, even if adverse.

60. 1 have been referred to Stephen Dilley's email dated 8 September 2006

   [POL00069599] and another email at [FUJ00122333] (plus attachments at

   [FUJ00122334] and [FUJ00122335]). Again, aside from the fact that I have now

   seen what is written in the email and the witness statement and exhibit of Mr

   Andrew Dunks (neither of which I recall), I have no recollection of any interactions

   with Fujitsu.

61 As regards Gareth Jenkins and Anne Chambers, I remember the names and I think

   that Anne Chambers was a witness at the trial, as appears to be confirmed in

   paragraph 23 of the Judgment. I do not remember anything more than that, really,

   and I could not now say what role they had or what their involvement, abilities or

   knowledge of bugs, errors or defects might have been. I do not remember Penny

   Thomas at all.

62. My thinking and case strategy were formed on the basis of the case on which I

   was instructed, namely POL v Castleton, and they were not affected by other

   cases. I was not told there were any inherent problems with the Horizon system,

   nor was it ever suggested or requested that I should avoid reliance on the Horizon

   system. My strategy for the case was based solely on my analysis of the best way

   to prove the loss forensically. I had the documents that were in the trial bundle, the

   contract to which Mr Castleton was a party, and the legal argument deployed in my

  skeleton. On the basis of the documents signed by Mr Castleton, it seemed to me

  that what may or may not have happened elsewhere was unlikely to affect the

  outcome in this case. I have read the attendance note at [P0L00070137]. I do not

   remember the events recorded in it (or in the other documents to which my

  attention was drawn), but I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of what is said

  there. I note that the Judge also considered the relevance of alleged issues with
                                          20

   the Horizon system arising at other branches and ruled on such at paragraph 22

   of the Judgment.

63. 1 have no recollection of settlement discussions before trial° so far as I can

   remember anything at all, I think they were conducted without my involvement save

   to the extent that I was asked to convey the position of POL to my opposing

   Counsel, and save that I very likely expressed a very firm belief that the case

   should be settled because even the irrecoverable legal costs on both sides were

   out of all proportion to the amount at stake, I do not now recall being asked to

   express any view on any undertaking by Mr Castleton not to repeat allegations or

   make any further allegations regarding the Horizon system, and I do not recall ever

   being involved in discussions about whether that was important to POL. I cannot

   now recall anything about any confidentiality clause or whether it might have been

   important to POL, but I note from [POLOOO69763] that Mr Dilley did not think that

   the Tomlin Order needed a confidentiality clause.

64. 1 have read the emails from November 2006 at [POL00069766], [POLO0113911],

   and [POL00069756]. I have a vague recollection that Mr Castleton was said to be

   unwell, but I do not recall ever being asked to express any opinion or give any

   advice on what to do. As far as I recall, the relationship with Mr Castleton was

   handled by my Instructing Solicitors or people at POL.

65. 1 have considered the document at [POL00069910] and have no recol lection of the

   PTR on Monday 27 November 2006 and I have no recollection of any instructions

   on the stance POL wished to adopt in relation to Mr Castleton's application to

   adjourn the trial.   However, it is clear from the email from Mark Turner, Mr

   Castleton's then solicitor, at [POL00069756] that, having spoken to Mr Castleton's

   doctor, he believed Mr Castleton had capacity and was able to give instructions. It

   Castleton was well enough to attend trial (although that was not a document that I

   apparently saw). I have no recollection of how the application for an adjournment

   was made or whether I even knew that it was going to be made, but it may just

   have been made orally by Mr Castleton at the hearing and I am not even sure I

   made any submissions (but it is fair to say that I actually don't remember anything

   at all about the hearing). I do not remember Mr Castleton ever seeming to be ill or

   more stressed than a normal litigant at the PTR. or at the trial. I seem to have some

   vague recollection that I talked to him outside Court before the trial began and

   explained to him how I would help him by explaining the case neutrally to the Judge

   and that if he needed a break to let me know. I do not recall him ever saying to me

   personally that he did need a break or that he could not go on. I also do not recall

   him identifying to the Judge any similar issue or need during the course of the trial.

66.. 1 have read paragraphs 67 and 68 of Mr Castleton's Witness Statement dated 13

   May 2022 at [WITN03730100].

67.At paragraph 66 Mr Castleton refers to arriving at Court "on the Monday' and at

   paragraph 67 he says that the judge "decided to start that Wednesday'. I can see

   from my Chambers' diary that the hearing of the PTR was Monday 27 November

   2006 and the first day of the hearing was Monday 4 December 2006. 1 therefore

   assume that the reference to the Monday" was to Monday 4 December 2006, the

   first day of the trial.

68. 1 have no recollection of the conversation that is said to have occurred or of

   allegedly providing him with his "court bundle" and I find what is alleged hard to

   reconcile with any reconstruction of what might have happened.

69.As far as I can recollect; I think all the hearings took place at the Technology and

   Construction Court (the "TCC") which was then located in Clifford's Inn on Fetter

   Lane. I cannot specifically recall those days in November and December 2006, but

   I find it hard to believe that I would have attended at Court for a trial commencing

   on Monday 4 December 2006 knowing that Mr Castleton was going to be there but

   leaving any bundle for him for that trial back in Chambers.

70. Secondly, my recollection is that the court bundle, far from being a single bundle,

   was perhaps 10 or so lever arch files. I also note from the telephone attendance

   note dated 1 December 2006 at [        L00069871] that Mr Dilley records a telephone

   call with Mr Castleton that morning in which Mr Castleton confirmed that he had

   received the bundle and that Mr Dilley asked him to check carefully and

   immediately let him know 'if he hadn't received any of them" (which suggests that

   this was the trial bundles, plural).

71.Thirdly, save for conversations with opposing counsel (and even then I try to have

   a witness present if possible) my practice has always been never to talk to anyone,

   be they my lay client, a witness or a representative of the opposition, unless that

   conversation can take place in the presence of my Instructing Solicitor.

72. Fourthly, I cannot imagine walking back from the TCC on Fetter Lane to Chambers

   in Lincoln's Inn whilst being accompanied by a lay opponent but not also being

   accompanied by my Instructing Solicitor: indeed, having been at the TCC with my

   Instructing Solicitor, I cannot imagine why he would not then have dealt with

   provision of bundles himself without my involvement, given that it is no part of my

   instructions to get involved in serving bundles.

73. Fifthly, Mr Castleton says "When we arrived there he pulled me aside", suggesting

   that his version is that we travelled there together. Yet having walked back to my
                                            23

                                                                                   WITNO8570100




   Chambers, there is nowhere, location wise, for me to have `pulled [Mr Castleton]

   aside and told lhimJ not to go on Wednesday." The corridor to my room had a

   security lock on it and I would not allow a member of the public access to that, and

   I cannot imagine a conversation taking place in the reception area to Chambers. I

   also cannot imagine from whom, or why, I might have needed to "pull Mr Castleton

   aside": it simply makes no sense to me that I would have wanted or needed to pull

   him aside; as I would have wanted any conversation to be as public as possible for

   precisely the reason that any private conversation runs the risk of a dispute over

   whether anything, and if so what, was said, as now appears to be occurring, albeit

   17 years after the event.

74. Finally, I doubt I would have told Mr Castleton to meet me outside my Chambers

   to give him his court bundle, even had it been a single bundle and even if I had

   been in the position of having Mr Castleton's bundles delivered to me by my

   Instructing Solicitors (and I have no idea why they would have done that).   I would

   not want to wait around outside chambers for someone to turn up, far less stand

   there outside with a set of bundles in December, and particularly when that is

   something that could be dealt with perfectly well by my clerks and Chambers'

   receptionists.

75 As I have said, I have no recollection of the alleged conversation, and for the

   reasons set out above, I would be surprised if it took place as described. Any

   conversations that did take place would, I expect, have taken place with my

   Instructing Solicitors present.

76. In the circumstances, Mr Castleton's evidence differs from my recollection, my

   belief as to the likelihood of what he says having occurred and my reconstruction

   of the possible scenarios.

                                                                                     WITNO8570100




77. So far as I am able to remember, I did not provide Mr Castleton with a copy of his

   bundle or bundles, nor did I meet with him, either inside or outside Chambers, in

   December 2006, nor did I pull him aside, nor did I have the alleged conversation

   with him on that or any other occasion. In the circumstances I cannot provide an

   account of the alleged conversation with him.        I have no knowledge whether

   anyone else met with Mr Castleton to provide him with any bundles, or if so who

   they were or when and where they met him. I just do not think that was person

   was me.

78, In the circumstances, I currently believe Mr Castleton is regrettably mistaken in his

   recollection and his account is not accurate.

79. Save to the extent that there was mention in some of the emails at the time of my

   instruction to error messages that had occurred in the past in relation to the

   operation of Horizon at one or two other branches for reasons that were identified

   (and I can't recal l anything beyond what is said in the emails to which my attention

   has been drawn), so far as I can now recall I did not at the time, and do not now,

   have any knowledge of any alleged bugs, errors or defects in the Horizon IT

   system, other than that I now know that Mr Justice Fraser has made certain findings

   in relation to that system. Put the other way round, had I known at the time of

   alleged bugs, errors or defects in the Horizon IT system then I am sure that I would

   still remember knowing of therm, but, as I have said, I do not. I do know that Mr

   Castleton said that other sub-postmasters had made complaints about the

   operation of Horizon and the Judge addressed that issue in paragraph 22 of his

   Judgment.

80 1 had, and have, no reason to believe anything other than that POL, with the

   assistance of my Instructing Solicitors, gave proper disclosure in accordance with
                                           25

                                                                                     WITNO8570100




   the Civil Procedure Rules. So far as I can recall (and I am sure that I would recall,

   had it occurred), nothing ever came to my attention, either before or after the trial,

   that had not been disclosed and that I believed should have been.

81. Regarding pages 47 to 48 of the transcript of the Inquiry hearings from 19 May

   2022 [INt 00001025], I do not recall saying the words Mr Castleton attributes to

   me and I don't believe that I would have said them as it was not part of POL's

   pleaded case and there was no advantage in making the allegation. I note in

   passing that the end of paragraph 3 of the judgment of His Honour Judge Lavery

   Q.C. dated 11 January 2007 records correctly that I, on behalf of POL, disclaimed

   any dishonesty on the part of Mr Castleton, and that position is therefore

   established definitively as a matter of public record. However, if necessary or

   appropriate the matter can, no doubt, be established by calling for a copy of the

   transcript and seeing what was actually said by whom, to whom and in what

   context. In the circumstances, I currently believe Mr Castleton is mistaken in his

   recollection.

82. I have been asked to consider the following documents:

      a. A letter from Stephen Dilley to me enclosing Tivoli events logs dated 22

          December 2006 [POLO0072516];

      b. an email from Stephen Dilley to me dated 3 January 2007 [POL00070062];

      c. a letter from Stephen Dilley to Lee Castleton dated 4 January 2007

          [POL00071881],

      d. a draft letter from Stephen Dilley to Lee Castleton dated 8 January 2007

          [LCAS00000478];

      e. an email from Stephen Dilley to Mandy Talbot, copied to me and others

          dated 8 January 2007 [P0L00070049];
                                          26

                                                                                      WITNO8570100




       f.   an attendance note dated 8 January 2007 [P0L00070050];

       g. a letter from Stephen Dilley to me enclosing further copy of Tivoli events

            logs dated 9 January 2007 [POL00072541];

       h. an email from Stephen Dilley to Mandy Talbot, copied to me and Tom Beezer

            dated 9 January 2007 [PL00081865]; and

       i.   and email from Stephen Dilley to Mandy Talbot on 12 January 2007 at

            [POL00073768].

83. 1 have no recollection of the Tivoli logs or what Mr Castleton thought those logs

   were meant to show or how they were relevant to Mr Castleton's case. So far as I

   recall, my case strategy throughout the trial had been to base POL's proof of the

   loss on records produced, or whose accuracy had been verified, by Mr Castleton

   personally. My recollection now is that Mr Castleton's position at the time was that

   his figures were true and accurate. My recollection at this point in time is that I did

   not understand the case being made by Mr Castleton or how he could say that

   there was no loss if his own figures were accurate.

84 1 have no clear recollection, but I do vaguely recall that the trial was re-opened for

   further cross-examination of witnesses. I see from the documents identified to me

   that those 2 witnesses were said to be Anne Chambers and Ruth Simpson. I have

   no recollection of the topics upon which they were examined, but from the

   preceding email traffic it seems reasonable to suppose that it was something to do

   with the Tivoli events log (the purpose and content of which I cannot remember).

   Again, if this point is important to the Inquiry, it can no doubt be established

   definitively by reference to the transcript of the hearing.

85. In terms of the overall picture in this case, as far as I can recall I was comfortable

   at the time with the advice that I gave, and that was accepted, to seek to prove

                                                                                         WITNO8570100




       POL`s case as an account stated by reference to Mr Castleton's own signed

      accounting records, and in the alternative for an account to be taken by the Court..

       I have not seen anything since to change that view.

85, 1 suppose that, had I been really aggressive in my advice and conduct of the case,

       I would not have called any witnesses at all for POL, but then I suspect I would

      have been criticised for (supposedly) trying to hide the impact of Horizon and/or

      deprive Mr Castleton of his day in Court and his opportunity to make his case that

      somehow the problems all lay with Horizon,




87. 1 have gone back to my Chambers' diary and my fee notes to try to remind myself

      of what happened and when after the Case concluded. Regrettably, over the past

      17 years the data from 2006 and thereafter has been migrated onto at least one

      new platform and some of my records are not intelligible to me. I therefore provide

      this answer on a very impressionistic level of what I vaguely recall happening by

      reference to some diary entries,

88. 1 think the fee line entry for my Advice identifies that it was sent out on 22 January

      2007 [POL00090437]. I think (but I may be mistaken) that I had a conference with

      representatives of POL after that, and my hazy recollection is that it was bright and

      sunny, from which I think it might have been in the spring or summer time,

      presumably of 2006, but I can find no fee line entry. It is possible that it was

      immediately after judgment was delivered, but I really cannot be sure.

89.          impressionistic recol lection is that, at that conference, I was asked something
      ally




      along the lines of, how should POL manage their systems in order to rely on the

      judgment? My recollection of my advice was that the only way to be confident of

                                                28
                                                                                       WITN08570100
                                                                                    WITNO8570100




   being able to prove anything was to require each sub-postmaster to maintain and

   sign their own physical records and accounts.

90. 1 should emphasise that this recollection is very, very vague and I cannot be sure

   that I have not over the years created a memory from another meeting and

   superimposed the gist of my written Advice, but this is what I think happened to the

   best of my recollection. Given the absence of a fee line entry, I also cannot be sure

   of the timing of any meeting, even if it did take place, unless it took place on the

   day judgment was handed down.

91. According to My Chambers' fee note system, I received the following other sets of

   instructions on behalf of POL:

      a. On 3 April 2007 in a matter called Post Office v Aslam, where I considered

          the papers and advised Mr Bellgrove (who I do not remember) by telephone

          once. Nothing further seems to have happened. I have no recollection at

          all as to what it concerned.

      b. On 4 December 2007 in a matter called Mr Bilkhu v Post Office Limited.

          Apparently, I had a telecon and settled draft Particulars of Defence and

          Counterclaim on 6 December 2007 and gave some further advice in January

          2008, but that appears to be the limit of my involvement in that case, and I

          have no recollection at all as to what it concerned.

      c. On 19 October 2011 1 received instructions in a matter called Scott

          Darlington & Ors v Post Office Ltd. Although I have no recollection of the

          matter, I appear to have advised in a 2-hour consultation on 26 October

          2011 and again on 12 December 2011, but no hearing appears to have then

          taken place, I had no further involvement, and I have no recollection at all

          about this matter.

d. On 29 November 2011 1 received instructions in a matter called Prosser v

     Post Office Ltd. I gave some preliminary advice in 2 calls which I cannot

     remember, and my clerks gave a fee quote for attending the hearing of an

     appeal in Cardiff for which I was not subsequently instructed.         Nothing

     further appears to have happened on this matter, and I cannot remember

     anything about this case.

e. On 12 June 2012 1 had a very short consultation (it looks like it may have

     been only 30 minutes) on something where I don't even appear to have

     received any papers. The matter is entitled simply Post Office and there are

     no other fee line entries for work done. I have no recollection of the matter.

f.   On 20 March 2014 1 was contacted by Linklaters to advise Post Office

     Limited. My records show 3 short telecons, although I think (although I

     might wel l be mistaken) that I had also had a short in person consultation

     with Christa Band of Linklaters and Paula Vennels of POL (I can find no fee

     line entry for this). I have no specific recollection of what was happening

     beyond thinking that I was asked what could POL do about any arguments

     being raised in relation to the accuracy of the Horizon system, to which my

     answer was that they should follow the Advice that I had given in 2007 and

     keep a physical paper trail of accounts signed by the sub-postmaster. Given

     that I can find no record in my diary, I should emphasise that this memory

     of a meeting and the identity of the participants may be a "false" memory,

     possibly something I reconstructed having been told there would be a

     meeting. As of now, I am really not at all sure that a physical meeting ever

     took place, and given the absence of a fee line entry I think it is more likely



                                      30
                                                                                       WITNO8570100
                                                                                    WITN08570100




          than not that my memory is mistaken and that my involvement extended no

          further than telling Christa Band what I would say in consultation.




02. I have been asked whether there are any other matters that I would like to bring to

   the attention of the Chair of the Inquiry. In recent years I have seen various books,

   articles and comments online that make reference to the Post Office Limited v

   Castleton case. The general assumption in those materials seems to be that, in

   some way, the operation of the Horizon IT System was an issue in the Case that

   led to judgment being given in favour of POL. However, a review of the pleadings,

   the witness statements and the judgment should provide enough information to

   confirm that the case in fact turned on Mr Castleton's own signed books, records

   and accounts produced by him as the agent of POL.

Statement of Truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.
