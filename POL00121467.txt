Forensic Services
POL00121467
POL00121467

The process for obtaining Forensic Services is currently being reviewed by Nick Mistry, SIS, SSU. He expects to
complete the review early in the New Year and communicate details of the suppliers and process for obtaining services
in the February newsbrief. As the contracts with the suppliers are being negotiated and the situation is changing
constantly it is necessary to introduce an interim process, details below.

Security staff should first obtain authority to buy in forensic services in accordance with their Business Unit protocols.
Once authority has been obtained, the precise requirements should be e-mailed to Nick Mistry, unless the request is
urgent when contact should be made by phone. Nick will provide details of the appropriate supplier, again by e-mail.
Security staff will then deal direct with the supplier. SIS will continue to manage the contracts with the suppliers,
including billing and settlement of accounts.

In order that SIS may reconcile charges and with services provided Security staff must quote the SIMS Event Number
in all dealings, especially correspondence with suppliers. In the unlikely event that a supplier asks for a budget code
Security staff should refer the matter to Nick Mistry.

For further information contact: Nick Mistry STD } I or Mobex!

SIMS WMS

‘Missing’ events

SSU still receive a number of calls re 'missing' events- i.e. events which security managers know have been reported to
the call centre but have not appeared in their new event list as expected. There can be a number of reasons for this, the
most common being that a full postcode was not correctly entered which would result in the event being routed to the
Business Unit Routing Failure Administrator. Therefore he/she is a good first point of contact if you believe you have
‘lost’ an event in the system- the RFAs were listed in the last Newsbrief. Failing that, the ‘lost’ event should be notified
to Nick Mistry, Procedural Support Manager or the Business Systems helpdesk P/I (specifying the problem
is with SIMS WMS).

Please do NOT ring the call centre again to re-submit a ‘lost’ event, as this creates duplicates in the database which
then distort any reports/ analysis being extracted from the system! Another change to be added in the next release will
provide all security managers with the ability to search the system for a specific event id and find out who has that
event, which should solve the problem of ‘lost' events.

Likewise, if you receive an event in error that you believe has been mistakenly assigned to your Business Unit, please
could you transfer it to the RFA for the Business Unit you think it should belong to.

+ User Group

Any suggestions for improvements should be submitted via line managers to the relevant territorial management team
and hence to the SSU Programme Support Manager for the territory. The PSMs will feed all useful suggestions through
to the User Group for consideration.

The User Group met for the second time on 3 December and reviewed the specifications for changes to the system
drawn up by Business Systems against the three priority requirements and all agreed they would provide useful extra
functionality; these changes enable team leaders to see a summary of all the events, projects and investigations held by
their team on one screen, to access a more detailed summary for an individual, and to view a history of all previous
progress notes added to an investigation. The changes will be implemented in the next release of the system, hopefully
in late January. The exact release date will be notified by email to all users nearer the time.

Three new priorities for the subsequent release were then identified and sub groups are due to meet in January to work
up detailed requirements for these, which will then will be costed by Business Systems and considered by the SSU
Application Owner against the remaining budget for 2001/2.

+ Post Office Limited

Post Office Network was replaced on SIMS WMS on 7th December by two new Business Units, Post Office Limited -
Investigations and Post Office Limited- External Crime. The latter (headed by Laury Callan) will investigate burglaries,
robberies and counter snatches, and includes the POL Audit team, whilst the former (headed by Phil Gerrish) will deal
with investigations concerning POL staff and agents. From January, the Routing Failure Administrator for both BUs will
be Robert Daily.

+ Solving problems

Any problems using SIMS WMS, call Business Systems helpdesk on, _}, specifying that you are using 'SIMS
WMS'. Most common problems will be routed to Nick Mistry to deal, whilst more serious issues will be picked up by our
Business Systems Application Support team.

Useful Information

SECURITY CALL CENTRE

I recently spent two days sitting with staff on the Security Call Centre with the objective of being able to impart some of
my knowledge of Post Office Ltd procedures and processes and for my own part, having used SIMS in tandem with
case papers, to see how SIMS operates from the initial point of contact perspective.
POL00121467
POL00121467

I am probably not the only investigator who has found that reporting an incident to the call centre can be a time
consuming process, so I was looking forward to the prospect of seeing things from ‘their’ side.

On day one Alison Pollitt, one of the call centre managers, spent a great deal of time providing me with an overview of
the call centre processes, whilst introducing me to all of the staff on duty.

My first thoughts centred on the vast knowledge required to run the call centre. From my own point of view, keeping
abreast of just POL policies and procedures is a weighty challenge, without taking into consideration the various other
business units the call centre deals with. I saw first hand the importance of call centre operators taking all the relevant
details without which transferring the ‘event’ to the appropriate business unit/team leader would be impossible. It is
particularly importance to ensure that the event, as related by the caller, is recorded with the correct crime type (there
are 19 at present) and includes the correct category of crime (of which there are currently 165 !!).

Overall, I was impressed with the way the call centre operates, particularly as it has only been running since June 2001.
Given the wide variety of calls received, the staff are required to have knowledge on all facets of the business in order
to provide a comprehensive centralised recording system of all crimes/incidents reported within the organisation. As
they continue to develop their knowledge and improve their own internal processes, I believe the call centre will
become a valuable tool in the ‘fight against crime’.

SURVEILLANCE TRAINING

On the 26 November, fifteen staff comprising of 9 from IS, 3 from Apostle and 3 from L&C attended the first
Surveillance Training Course held by Essex Police at Chelmsford Police Training School for a two week period.
Experience within the group ranged from 18 months to 12 years but as the course unfolded it became a learning curve
for all introducing new skills, tactics and the use of covert radio equipment.

Prior to the first day in the classroom, pre reading material consisting of a thick manual and video were found to be a
little daunting by most especially when attempting to learn a whole new vocabulary of police glossary terms but
procedures began to fall into place when combined with the classroom teaching.

Our group of 15 was spilt into five teams of three and each team was assigned a dedicated trainer, who had previously
worked as a surveillance officer. After the usual introductions our first lesson began in foot surveillance. Assuming that
the first days workload would be light we were then sent straight out to put into practice the use of props, positioning,
glossary terms and various communications via hand signals, radio and click systems. Despite many of us in the past
having followed a postman at some time in our career, this was using completely different tactics and it certainly was
not as easy as it sounded.

As the course progressed our skills greatly improved, learning different surveillance techniques in driving, on trains, in
airports and motorways with the invaluable assistance of a motor cyclist. When covering surveillance by vehicle the
three in each car certainly worked as a team, undertaking turns in driving, radio communication, map reading,
POL00121467
POL00121467

deploying foot units and one of the most important aspects maintaining evidence by way of log keeping.

The second week put us all to the test on a daily basis. Each team was given a location to plot, and command followed
by a full briefing in the classroom first thing each morning. The aim was to gather as much information on known and
unknown subjects to assist the team the next day and also sufficient evidence to arrest one or more persons at the end
of the week once the full picture had been painted.

Surveillance training within the Security Community has previously been limited and was not of a sufficient standard to
work with other outside agencies. This course has now given people the knowledge, confidence and skills to now
achieve this on a professional basis.

Congratulations to all those who passed with flying colours. This was a tough but most rewarding course that is highly
recommended for those within the Security Community. A further course is currently being planned for May 2002 with
an extra course for one day on detailed log keeping.

Sue O'Connor, Investigation Services.
