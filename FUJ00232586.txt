COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

1 Introduction

This document provides a high level summary of Reconciliation within the baseline Horizon solution so that it can
be understood how Reconciliation Service can best support the HNG-X transitioning and thereafter.

This document also outlines the Reconciliation incident management procedures required to investigate, report and
resolve all reconciliation incidents, which are identified via the DRS (Data Reconciliation Service) reports and also
incident raised via HSD (Horizon Service Desk).

1.1. What is Reconciliation?

End to end Reconciliation within Horizon is the mechanism by which Post Office Ltd and POA establish
which transactions are complete and correct, and which are not. An incomplete transaction is not
necessarily a Reconciliation error, but it might become one if it is not completed in a timely manner. An
incorrect transaction is a Reconciliation error.
Each and every Reconciliation error is the result of some system fault. That fault might, for example, be
a software bug (introduced through either design or coding), a system crash, or a telephone line being
dug up. Such faults may affect transactions, thus it is the job of Reconciliation Service to detect when
and how any transaction is affected by any system fault.
A reported Reconciliation error provides:

e A business impact in terms of an error report on a transaction, and

e Evidence of a system fault that may need some corrective action.

It is acknowledged that not all system faults will lead to corrective action as this is generally done on a
contractual and/or cost benefit basis.

1.2. What does Reconciliation look like?

Reconciliation is delivered as a set of printable electronic reports (typically .txt files). The content and
layout of the reports reflect the system architecture. This has been detailed in the SVM/SDM/SD/0020:
End to End Reconciliation Reporting document.

1.3. Howis Reconciliation used?

Recon

jation is used by Post Office Ltd:

e To provide Financial and Business Reconciliation at transaction level, i.e. to prove that each
transaction is complete and correct and to report any transaction that is either not complete or
not correct. Whilst zero value transactions might not affect settlement or accounts, excessive
numbers can represent lost business. In addition, some APS transactions are zero value, but
they must still be passed through to the end client, e.g. Card Account transactions, some DVLA
transactions.

e To prove the accounts are correct and to enable individual transactions to be identified that are
causing discrepancies in or incompleteness of the accounts.

e For settlement with Clients either by providing information to contribute towards the invoice or
payment generation.

FUJITSU Document

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

Reconciliation is used by Reconciliation Service:

e For system diagnostics (fault finding) and to prove system integrity. Normally, all transactions
are of interest including those with zero value. Zero value on-line transactions often indicate
some ‘network’ issue that caused the transaction to time out at the Counter. While it may be
acceptable for there to be a background level of these, they must be monitored so that
corrective action can take place if the volumes become excessive.

e For explaining to Post Office Ltd why transactions are incomplete or incorrect and to provide
evidence to support statements made;

e To prove that corrective action is effective.

Typically, Reconciliation reports fulfil the purposes of both Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail Group Account
without the need for separate reporting for each organisation.

Banking and Related Services (Online Services)

The Banking and Related Services Reconciliation Report Set or the DRS Report set are used by Post
Office Ltd for Reconciliation and settlement with Clients and by Reconciliation Service as input to error
resolution and as evidence when advising POL of the true state of transactions.

Five different report sets are produced for transactions categorised below for the different Clients:

Network Banking transactions for Clients:

Alliance & Leicester,
Card Account for Post Office (CAPO),
LINK

Electronic Top Ups transactions for Client EPAY
Debit & Credit Card (D&CC) transactions for Client Streamline

3.1

DRS Reports

The DRS is the Data Reconciliation Service for NBS, DCS and ETS. It is an implementation of a state
table based on five input flows, [C12], [C112], [S], [C4], and [D]. It also has a [C2] output flow that is
generated from the [C12] input flow.

.

[C12] flow comes direct from the Counter

[C112] flow comes from the Counter via TPS

[S] flow is optional and is used by DCS only to reflect the extended [C2] feed to Streamline to

enable Post Office Ltd to view a preliminary settlement position

[C4] flow reflects the bank view of the transaction, and the

[D] flow represents an error form of the [C4] flow when it can be determined that a transaction is

inconsistent from the bank point of view.

The diagram below ‘Reconciliation in Horizon’ gives the overview of the following data flows:

[R] Request message, [A] Authorisation message, [CO] Confirmation for 0 Value and [E]
Reversal that form the RACE that is captured by the NPS (NBX Persistent Store).

REC (Reconciliation file) to A&L, CAPO.

LREC (Link Reconciliation file) from LINK,

DTF (Daily Transaction Feed) from EPAY,

Payment file to Streamline which contains [S],

EMIS (Electronic Management Information Service) from Streamline

APS Client transaction files to Clients

If any of the transaction data flows are unavailable, this results in the creation of an ‘Exception State’ as
defined in Section 3.5 of this document.
In addition, a transaction may well receive the full set of transaction sub components described above

however one or more of these sub components may be for a differing or corrupt value when compared to
the others. In such cases, an “ERROR STATE” will be created as defined in Section 3.5 of this

document.

The reports produced are:

* NBOOO DRS Summary Report. This is a single daily report covering NBS, DCS, and ETS. It lists
all reports produced and identifies those not produced as there is no data with which to populate
them.

e NB101 Network Banking Settlement Statement. This is a separate daily report for each Client. It
is the baseline used for Client settlement subject to corrections based on the error reports.
Essentially, it reports the [C4] position.

« NB102 section 1 All Uncleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & Post Office Ltd FS exceptions. This is
a separate daily report for each Client. It is an error report used to correct the settlement figure.

e NB102 section 2 Uncleared Exception Client Transactions. This is a separate daily report for
each Client. It is an error report used to correct the settlement figure.

e NB102 section 3 Uncleared corruptions. This is a separate daily report for each client. It is an
error report used to correct the settlement figure.

e NB102 section 4 Uncleared Timing Differences. This is a separate daily report for each Client. It
is an error report used to correct the settlement figure.

« NB102 section 5 Uncleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & Post Office Ltd FS exceptions >24 hours.
This is a separate daily report for each Client. It is an error report used to correct the settlement
figure. Transactions do not appear on it unless they have not changed state for more than 24
hours (i.e. there is no transaction progression). In addition, where the only fault is a missing
[C112] and the Branch not harvested flag is set, then the transaction is inhibited from appearing
on this report.

e NB102 section 6 Uncleared Future Dated Transactions by Client. This is a separate daily report
for each of NBS and DCS (ETS is treated as though it is a Client within NBS). It is used to report
summaries of transactions that are ‘future dated’ and therefore do not fall into the normal scope
of Reconciliation until a future Reconciliation overnight. Future Dated refers to the Reconciliation
date, not the date on which the transaction took place.

e NB102 section 7 All Cleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & Post Office Ltd FS exceptions. This is a
separate daily report for each Client. It is used to demonstrate that errors were ‘cleared’ from the
DRS correctly.

« NB102 section 8 Cleared Exception Client Transactions. This is a separate daily report for each
Client. It is used to demonstrate that errors were ‘cleared’ from the DRS correctly.

« NB102 section 9 Cleared corruptions. This is a separate daily report for each Client. It is used
to demonstrate that errors were ‘cleared’ from the DRS correctly.

e NB102 section 10 Cleared Timing Differences. This is a separate daily report for each Client. It
is used to demonstrate that errors were ‘cleared’ from the DRS correctly.

e NB102 section 11 Cleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & Post Office Ltd FS exceptions >24 hours.
This is a separate daily report for each Client. It is used to demonstrate that errors were ‘cleared’
from the DRS correctly.

« NB102 section 12 Cleared Future Dated Transactions by Client. This is a separate daily report
for each of NBS and DCS (ETS here is treated as though it is a Client within NBS). It is used to
report summaries of transactions that were future dated but are now entered in to the main
Reconciliation stream.

The report definitions are common to all applications although differences of the RAC model mean that
for each of NBS, DCS and ETS the interpretation of the reports for each application must vary
significantly.

the following Service Level Targets:

Delivery of reconciliation & settlement report (Normal) By 08.05hrs day B

Delivery of reconciliation & settlement report (where DRS I By 10.05hrs day B
failure in overnight batch window)

Delivery of reconciliation & settlement report (where there is I By 12.00hrs day B
system failure that is not DRS or TES)

Delivery of reconciliation & settlement report (where there is I By 18.00hrs day B
DRS or TES failure)

Enrichment with LREC data

LREC received Added to reconciliation &
settlement report

LREC received by 23.59.59hrs day A By 08.05hrs day B

LREC received by 01.59.59hrs day B By 08.05hrs day B

LREC received between 02.00hrs and 22.00hrs day B By 08.05hrs day C

All reports will be produced as ASCII text files - one for each report. The report layout will be fixed
format with space characters providing the blank space. This will allow for ‘Excel’ input, using fixed field
width facilities. Any formatting, (lines and shading) will not be included within the file.

3.2.1 Contingency in the Event on Non delivery of reports to Post
Office Ltd

If Fujitsu Services is unable to deliver any or all reports to the Post Office Ltd. / POLFS gateway by
08.00hrs the day following the run date of the report, Fujitsu Reconciliation Service will liaise with POL
Finance to arrange an e-mail transmission via the Fujitsu corporate account. Fujitsu Reconciliation
Service will operate this contingency under ‘reasonable endeavours’ and will aim to have the reports with
POL Finance by 09.00hrs in contingency. However this timescale may not be achievable if processing
problems have also delayed receipt of the reports into the DRS workstation.

NB: Should the Fujitsu corporate e-mail service unavailable, Fujitsu Reconciliation
Service will liaise with POL Finance and agree facsimile of reports NB101 and NB102
section 1 and 2.

Any distribution list for these reports is considered by both Fujitsu and Post Office Ltd to be of a dynamic
nature and therefore specific addressees are not covered within this document

3.3. Reconciliation & Incident Handling

Reconciliation Service shall study and monitor the DRS reports and report on any Banking and Related
Services transaction states which are:

e intrinsically anomalous, in that their occurrence implies malfunction in End to End On Line
Services; or

* anomalous in that an expected state has persisted for an unexpected duration (e.g. where C1
Confirmations are received from the Confirmation Agent and C4 Confirmations are received
from Alliance and Leicester, LINK CAPO, D&CC and ETU but the Confirmation from the TPS
Host has not been received after an abnormal delay),

Exceptions reported within the DRS Report Set will be applicable to:
e Communication difficulties between the Post Office branch and the Campus, Agents,
Correspondence servers, etc.
e Errors within the DRS (with corresponding errors returned via the TES)
e Corruption’s within the DRS

3.3.1 Generation of Business Incidents

It is envisaged that Business Incidents will only be generated by the following groups within Fujitsu and
Post Office Ltd.
e Fujitsu Reconciliation Service for all exceptions reported via the DRS report set.
e POL Finance for any ‘Enquiry Based Banking Transactions’ (EBBT) or ‘Disputed Transaction
Notice’ (DBTN) discovered by Post Office Ltd. that has not been reported by Fujitsu
Reconciliation Service via the DRS report set
e Fujitsu Third Line Support (SSC) for any system fault or database adjustment which is
considered by Fujitsu to have a reconciliation or settlement implication within Post Office
Ltd. in respect of banking and related transactions.

3.3.1.1. Business Incident raised by Reconciliation Service

Reconciliation Service will raise an appropriate Business Incident when needed via the BIMS database
for all exceptions that require reconciliation reported on the NB102 Section 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the DRS
report set.

3.3.1.2 EBBT incidents raised by POL Finance via HSD

It is important that POL Finance supply sufficient information to the HSD when generating a Business
Incident in respect of an EBBT to ensure the timescales for the resolution of Business Incidents referred
to in section 3.4.2 can be achieved. Achievement of such timescales is dependent upon the following
information being provided by POL Finance when generating a Business Incident via the HSD:

1. Avvalid ‘PATH’ code must be quoted, e.g. ‘PATH040’ etc.

2. Prefix all narrative with ‘This is a Business Incident for Reconciliation Service, PLEASE
ROUTE THIS CALL TO EDSC’ The following transaction detail:

¢ Branch code

e Horizon Transaction Identifier
¢ Value of transaction

« Date of transaction

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

NB: Where Post POL Finance raise a business incident for an EBBT Business which may require a large
amount of supporting information, summary detail only may be given to the HSD and the additional
information may be sent via e-mail to Fujitsu Reconciliation Service.

Subject to agreement by the parties to the contrary, Post Office branch calls to the HSD will not generate
Business Incidents. However calls from Post Office branches will be monitored and if it is considered
necessary by Fujitsu, difficulties reported to the HSD will be elevated to Business Incident status.

3.3.1.3. DBTN incidents raised by POL Finance via HSD

This facility is to support requirements in respect of Disputed Banking Transaction Notice (DBTN) where
Post Office Ltd. has received notification via either the Post Office branch or the Network Business
Support Centre (NBSC). POL Finance will contact Reconciliation Service directly by telephone,
requesting urgent investigation within the timescales quoted in section 3.4.2

Achievement of such timescales is dependent upon the following information being provided by POL
Finance when generating a DBTN enquiry via the Enquiry Service:

1. The following transaction detail:
e Client Account Number (the PAN)
« Branch code
« Horizon Transaction Identifier
¢ Value of transaction
¢ Date of transaction

NB: If incorrect or insufficient information is provided by POL Finance to allow resolution of the DBTN
enquiry, no further action will take place until new information is supplied and the enquiry will not be
monitored in accordance with the timescales referred to in section 3.4.2.

3.4 Business Incident Reporting

3.4.1. BIM Reports

The Business Incident Management System (BIMS) has been designed to report the progress to
resolution of a Business Incident to allow Post Office Ltd. to complete an accurate reconciliation or
settlement with their clients. For ease of identification and association, BIM report references will mimic
the Fujitsu fault logging (PEAK) reference. In all cases each BIM report will have a unique identifier.

3.4.1.1. Format & content of BIM report

ABIM report will be issued for each Business Incident generated. BIM reports are designed to notify POL
Finance of the detail required to assist in the reconciliation or settlement process within Post Office Ltd.
domain. BIM reports communicate information concerning the resolution of the symptom of an
underlying cause, not the cause itself. BIM reports will not advise any detail as to the underlying ‘Cause’
of the problem if this is a result of a software error etc. This information is supplied via the Problem
Management route (if escalated to this level).

Where a System Incident is generated to eradicate the cause of a particular problem and there is one or
more associated Business and Related Services Business Incidents, cross-references will be supplied on
the Business and Related Services Business Incident BIM report / MER and via the Problem
Management process to allow tracking of the System Incident.

3.4.1.2 BIM Report Distribution

Reconciliation Service will distribute BIM reports to POL Finance, using the Fujitsu corporate e-mail
network. In the event that this facility is temporarily unavailable, reports will be distributed via mutually
agreed methods (CD/Floppy etc).

BIM reports distributed in accordance with this section will be deemed to have been issued to POL
Finance at the time of transmission by mail.

Examples of BIM reports are shown in Section 6

3.4.1.3 Clearance Criteria

Reconciliation Service anticipates that it will provide information concerning On Line Services Business
Incidents to POL Finance on a ‘drip feed’ basis, by issuing updated versions of the initial BIM report /
MER.

e A BIM report is ‘Cleared’ when Reconciliation Service has provided the necessary
reconciliation / settlement information.

e Additionally, the exception is cleared from the appropriate section of NB102 after necessary
F99 authorisation has been obtained from POL.

POL Finance will advise via spreadsheet on a monthly basis of any payments it considers are payable to
Post Office Ltd (as compensation for Post Office Ltd. costs in dealing with MER). For the avoidance of
doubt, NO charges are payable in respect of MER issued for On Line Services incidents not
affecting the POLFS transaction stream.

If the parties disagree whether the POLFS transaction stream has been affected or not, or consequential
loss has been incurred by Post Office Ltd and after discussion no agreement can be reached the specific
incidents will then be escalated via a ‘Case Law Referral’ form, to the Commercial Forum for a final
decision to be made.

3.4.2 BIMS for Banking and Related Services - SLT conditions

Reconciliation Service will raise an initial BIM report relating to a new Business Incident, on the same
working day as the Business Incident is generated via the HSD or the Enquiry Service, or in any event
on the morning of the next working day. This will be made available in accordance with Section 3.4.1.1
to POL Finance. This initial, incomplete, BIM report will serve to notify POL Finance that a Business
Incident has occurred and that the completed BIM report will be provided to POL Finance within the
agreed timescales below.

In the event of the DRS Report Set not being available to Fujitsu Reconciliation Service in time to
enable any exceptions to be notified within this timescale, Fujitsu Reconciliation Service will contact the
POL Finance to agree a temporary extension to the timescale.

All enquiries and transaction searches within 90 days of the original transaction date will be carried out
by Reconciliation Service via the DRS/Transaction Enquiry Services (TES) Workstation(s). Enquiries
and transaction searches where the original transaction date is in excess of 90 days will be carried out by
Reconciliation Service using the Audit Archive via the Fujitsu POA security team. _

Reconciliation Service will ensure the final cleared BIM report, in accordance with the following
timescales:

1. For DBTN enquiries where the transaction date is within 90 days of the date the
transaction is disputed by the end customer and raised by POL via the HSD in
accordance with Section 3.3.1.3 :

95% must be resolved within <= 8 hours of notification based upon all DBTN
enquiries (Customer Critical Exceptions) received within the quarterly reporting
period

The following conditions apply to DBTN enquiries:

The calculation of the time to resolution within the above SLT will only commence from
either the receipt of the C4 or D transaction component within the DRS, or the reporting of a
Priority Exception, (which becomes a ‘Customer Critical Exception by way of the associated
DBTN), within NB102 section 5 of the DRS report set.

2. For any DBTN enquiries where the transaction date is in excess of 90 days of the date
the transaction is disputed by the end customer and raised by POL via the HSD in
accordance with section 3.3.1.3:

e All attempts will be made to resolve this within 5 Reconciliation Service days of
notification, but if there is a delay in obtaining evidence from the Security team,
SLA will be suspended after agreement with POL.

3. For any ‘Priority’ exception relating to incomplete states 4 or 12 reported within NB102
section 5 and raised by Fujitsu Reconciliation Service in accordance with section 3.3.1.1:

95% must be resolved within <= 8 hours commencing at 08.00hrs on the SECOND
Reconciliation Service day following receipt by the DRS of the exception, based upon
all Priority exceptions received within the quarterly reporting period.

4. For all non ‘Customer Critical’ exceptions reported within NB102 sections 2 — 5 and raised
via the HSD by Fujitsu Reconciliation Service in accordance with section 3.3.1.1:

* They must be resolved within 5 Reconciliation Service days of notification via
NB102 sections 2 -5.

5. For EBBT Business and Related Services reconciliation errors raised by POL via the HSD in
accordance with section 3.3.1.2 :

e All attempts will be made to resolve this within 5 Reconciliation Service days
from the date they were reported to the HSD, but if there is a delay in obtaining
evidence from the Security team, SLA will be suspended after agreement with
POL..

NB: All time is calculated using the Reconciliation Service day (08.00 to 17.30) and Monday to
Friday inclusive, excluding English bank holidays.

3.4.1.1. SLT Exclusion / Suspension Criteria

e Where an exception has been generated due to factors outside of Fujitsu control, e.g. where
a Post Office branch has failed to communicate due to fire, flooding or other agreed
‘Enforced Closure’ conditions, the exception will be removed from the BIM SLT calculation in
agreement with Post Office Ltd and resolved using ‘Reasonable Endeavours’.

e Where an exception necessitates the retrieval of information from, or access to, a Post
Office branch to enable successful resolution and this is not available. The period whilst
Fujitsu waits, having requested that information or access be provided, shall not count
towards the time for resolution of that exception.

Post Office Ltd. will be informed via the BIM report applicable to the exception being investigated that
SLT suspension is being invoked in respect of the above.

4 Automated Payment Service (APS)

The APS Report Set produced by Fujitsu central systems and the End-to-End APS reconciliation have
been designed to enable APS transactions completed in Post Office branches to be reconciled to the
transaction stream received by Post Office Ltd, via Post Office Ltd Financial Systems (POLFS) to
enable settlement to be made with Post Office Clients. This also applies to transactions of ZERO value,
while these transactions do not affect financial reconciliation they will be reported in cases where they
were not properly transferred to the Automated Payment (AP) Clients or POLFS.

For the avoidance of doubt, there is no formal reconciliation produced between the POLFS and POLMIS
transaction stream. The POLMIS stream should therefore not be used to verify financial integrity and
Post Office Ltd should ensure the TPS report set and POLFS transaction stream are used for this
purpose

4.1 APS Reports

The following reports are sent daily to POL Finance:
1. APSS2133 - The APS Daily Account Balancing Report
2. APSS2133b - The APS Client Summary Report
3. APSS2133c - The APS Delayed Transaction Report (See Section 4.1.2 )
4. APSS2136 - The Daily TPS / APS Transaction Reconciliation Summary Report
5. APSS2139 - The Daily APS Office Harvesting Report

4.1.1. Report Distribution

As governed by E Mail availability, Reconciliation Service will ensure all reports are made available to
POL Finance by 08.00hrs daily, on a Monday to Friday basis only. For example, on a Monday or the day
after a bank holiday, reports will be delivered for all days having occurred since the delivery of the last
set of reports.

Reports are initially sent to POL Finance using the Fujitsu corporate account. If the Fujitsu mail is not
available fall back measures will be made, i.e. floppy disk hand delivered to the Post Office Ltd member
within POL RDT (Ref Data Team) located on the 4" floor at the Fujitsu site at Bracknell.

NB: Due to the size of these reports, e.g. APSS2133b is often in excess of 100 pages, Fujitsu is unable
to resort to facsimile transmission should the corporate e mail service of either organisation be
unavailable except in situations where any failure is deemed to be long term. In such cases, the
Reconciliation Service will liaise with POL Finance to agree a contingency distribution.

The distribution list is considered by both Fujitsu and Post Office Ltd to be of a dynamic nature and
therefore specific addressees are not covered within this document.

4.2 APS Reconciliation & Incident Handling
4.2.1 APS Business Incidents

4.2.1.1 Reconciliation Errors within APSS2133 report

Reconciliation errors within the APS Daily Account Balancing Report should be minimal and, if they do
occur, will be applicable to:

° — Software errors
« Unidentified differences classed as ‘Reconciliation Errors’ within APSS2133.

4.2.1.2 Delayed Transactions on APSS2133c Report

Where transactions have been harvested by the APS harvester and have failed to be delivered to Post
Office Clients, they are referred to as Delayed Transactions.

In normal circumstances, these transactions will be input by Fujitsu SSC into the APS data file via the
APS secure workstation and will be received by Post Office Client, 24 hours later subject to the client's
delivery agreement. There may be occasions when transactions cannot be sent via the data file process
and have to be delivered to ‘Manual’. In such cases, full detail of the transaction is supplied via the BIM
report / Manual Error Report (MER) route which are NOT chargeable.

4.2.2. APS Business Incident Originators

It is envisaged that APS Business Incidents will only be generated by the following groups within Fujitsu
and Post Office Ltd:

e Fujitsu for errors reported via the APS report set & End-to-End APS reconciliation

e POL Finance or POL RDT for any other reconciliation or settlement error discovered by POL
Finance that has not been reported by Fujitsu Services

e Fujitsu SSC for any system fault or data ‘surgery’ which is considered by Fujitsu to have a
reconciliation or settlement implication within Post Office Ltd.

Subject to agreement by the parties to the contrary, Post Office branch raised calls to the Horizon
Service Desk (HSD) will not generate APS Business Incidents. However calls from Post Office branches
will be monitored and if it is considered necessary by Fujitsu difficulties reported to the HSD will be
elevated to APS Business Incident status.

4.2.3 Generation of Business Incidents

In line with the generic incident management policy agreed between Fujitsu and Post Office Ltd, APS
Business Incidents will only be recognised as such if generated by Fujitsu or Post Office Ltd as
appropriate, via the HSD. This ensures that the APS Business Incident is properly logged, enabling
Fujitsu to ensure that corrective information can be supplied and any underlying system fault can be
rectified.

It is important that POL Finance supply sufficient information to the HSD when generating an APS
Business Incident to ensure the timescales for the resolution of APS Business Incidents referred to in
section 5.4 can be achieved. Achievement of such timescales is dependent upon the following
information being provided by POL Finance when generating an APS Business Incident via the HSD:

e A valid ‘PATH’ code must be quoted, e.g. ‘PATH040' etc.

e Prefix all narrative with ‘This is a Business Incident for Reconciliation Service,
PLEASE ROUTE THIS CALL TO EDSC’

e Relevant details like the Branch code, date of the transaction, APS sequence number etc.
should also be supplied.

NB: Where POL Finance raises an APS Business Incident which may require a large amount of
supporting information, summary detail only may be given to the HSD and the additional information
sent via e-mail to Fujitsu . (A current contact list will be made available to POL Finance).

4.3 Incident Reporting
4.3.1. BIM Reports / MER

BIMS has been designed to report the progress to resolution of an APS Business Incident to allow POL
Finance to complete an accurate reconciliation (within POLFS) or settlement with their clients.

ABIM report will be issued for each APS Business Incident generated via the HSD. As part of that BIM
report, Fujitsu will issue a MER for each error associated with the relevant APS Business Incident where
it is necessary to do so to advising POL Finance of the transaction detail required to enable
reconciliation or settlement to take place.

BIM reports / MER are designed to notify POL Finance of the detail required to assist in the
reconciliation or settlement process within POLFS. They communicate information concerning the
resolution of the symptom of an underlying cause, not the cause itself. BIM reports / MER will not advise
any detail as to the underlying ‘Cause’ of the problem if this is a result of a software error etc. This
information is supplied via the Problem Management process. Where a Problem incident is generated
to eradicate the cause of a particular problem, and there is one or more associated APS Business
Incidents, cross-references will be supplied on the APS Business Incident BIM report / MER to allow
tracking of the System Incident.

MER which are raised for “lost” AP transactions which cannot be delivered to the AP Client will only be
chargeable on the basis of the transaction face value if it can be proven that:

« the End Customer has settled for that transaction,
e Fujitsu cannot provide the transaction detail; and

e the Post Office Client confirms non receipt.

4.3.1.1 Clearance Criteria

Reconciliation Service anticipates that it will provide information concerning APS Business Incidents to
POL Finance on a ‘drip feed’ basis, by issuing updated versions of the initial BIM report / MER.

A BIM report is ‘Cleared’ when Fujitsu has provided the information required to be contained in the
relevant BIM report.

Fujitsu will advise Post Office Ltd Operations Control via spreadsheet on a monthly basis of any
payments it considers are payable to Post Office Ltd (as compensation for cost incurred by Post Office
Ltd in dealing with MER) and / or its charges for dealing with widespread errors. For the avoidance of
doubt, NO charges are payable in respect of MER issued for APS incidents affecting the Post Office
Client transaction stream only.

If Fujitsu and Post Office Ltd cannot come to a specific agreement on financial settlement in respect of
costs incurred by Post Office Ltd, the specific incident(s) will then be escalated via a ‘Case Law Referral’
form, to the Commercial Forum for a final decision to be made.

4.3.1.2 Report Distribution

Reconciliation Service will distribute APS BIM reports / MER using the Fujitsu mail system.

BIM reports / MER distributed in accordance with this section will be deemed to have been issued to
POL Finance, and / or POL Finance given notice of any errors described therein, at the time of
transmission by mail.

Examples of BIM reports are shown in Section 6

4.3.2 Reporting Timescales

Reconciliation Service will use reasonable endeavours to raise an initial BIM report relating to a new
APS Business Incident within 24 hours of the notification of the incident. This will be made available to
POL Finance, on the same working day as the APS Business Incident is generated via the HSD, or in
any event on the morning of the next working day.

In the event of the APS report set not being available to Fujitsu in time to enable any errors to be notified
within this timescale, Fujitsu will contact POL Finance to agree a temporary extension to the timescale.
This initial, incomplete, BIM report will serve to notify POL Finance that a Business Incident has
occurred and that the completed BIM report will be provided to POL Finance within the agreed
timescales.

Reconciliation Service will use reasonable endeavours to ensure the final completed BIM report / MER,
is made available in accordance with section 5.1.and is cleared within five working days from the date
the APS Business Incident was generated via the HSD.

Where there is a need to correct APS / TPS Data Errors, Fujitsu will use reasonable endeavours to
deliver the corrected data file to POLFS within five working days from the date the APS Business
Incident was generated via the HSD. This may however, not always be practical due to the technicalities
of creating a corrected data file if there is a high volume of data.

There is no strict timescale for the resolution of a System Incident as the time taken to develop a fix or
correct erroneous reference data cannot be determined. Obviously however, Fujitsu will give every
System Incident the priority it deserves (including the Problem Management escalation process) taking
into account Post Office Ltd’s requirement and would aim to deliver an initial analysis of the root cause
within 5 working days and a final analysis and evidence of remedial action, within 10 working days.

If the Problem Management route is taken the issue will be closed by mutual agreement, usually after
certain criteria are met such as a relevant fix has been developed and tested, or a correction to the
relevant erroneous reference data has been authorised or approved for release through the appropriate
agreed procedures between Fujitsu and Post Office Ltd.

4.4 Client File Delivery

4.4.1 Variable File Transfer

Post Office Clients take transaction delivery from Fujitsu in accordance with their own processing
requirements. NB: Specific Client requirements are described elsewhere for each Client — this document
is not intended to describe each in detail.

APS transactions are harvested from Post Office Ltd branches on a seven-day basis and all are
available for onward transmission on each day to the Post Office Clients should they require it. However,
some Post Office Clients only require transactions to be delivered on a five day, or one day etc., per
week basis. This has no impact upon the reconciliation between the actual Post Office Client
transmission and the CTS.

The CTS accurately identifies the volume and value of the ‘normal’ transactions (not reversed / reversing
transactions) that have been delivered to the Post Office Clients on a particular day in accordance with
their specific requirements. It is important to note that the transactions actually delivered to Post Office
Clients as recorded on the CTS will differ from the value shown on APSS2133 within the Delivery Sub
Total (9). This figure represents the values harvested from the Post Office branches, which may, or may
not yet have been delivered to Post Office Clients in accordance with their requirements.

4.4.2 Reconciliation in the event of non delivery of the CTS to Post
Office Ltd

POL Finance will use the CTS as the basis for settlement with Post Office Clients. In the unlikely event
that Fujitsu fails to deliver the CTS file to POLFS or POLFS reject the file, POL Finance will need to use
the APSS2133b to manually calculate settlement due. The CTS only reports normal transactions
whereas the APSS2133b includes reversed / reversing transactions. Consequently POL Finance can
only use the APSS2133b to calculate the value (not the volume) of the settlements due.

It is also possible to send the CTS file to POL via email, if the normal means of delivery is not available.

Settlement is time critical and Fujitsu will ensure all the relevant system derived APS reconciliation
reports are delivered on time to ensure that settlement can be made between Post Office Ltd and its
Clients. In order to satisfy this requirement, Fujitsu has elected to make all reconciliation reports
available by 08.00hrs as stated in section 4.1.1, on a daily basis.

4.4.3 Clerical Reconciliation Example in the event of non delivery of
CTS to Post Office

When using the APSS2133b report to calculate settlements due, POL Finance will need to take account
of the individual Post Office Clients file delivery pattern and settlement frequency, e.g. for Post Office
Clients who have elected to take five day delivery - Monday to Friday the Monday delivery will include
transactions harvested on the Friday / Saturday and Sunday. For Post Office Ltd Clients who have
elected to take six day delivery - Monday to Saturday, the Monday delivery will include transactions
harvested on the Saturday and Sunday.

5 TPS Reconciliation

5.1 TPS Report Set

The Transaction Processing System (TPS) Report Set has been designed to enable reconciliation of the
transactions carried out in Post Office branches using the Electronic Point of Sale Service (EPOSS)
which are sent to Post Office Ltd Financial Systems (POLFS), and Post Office Ltd Management
Information Systems (POLMIS). The TPS report set identifies errors that occur within counter
transactions or during the harvesting process

NB: For the avoidance of doubt, there is no formal reconciliation produced between the POLFS
and POLMIS transaction stream. The POLMIS stream should therefore not be used to verify
financial integrity and Post Office Ltd should ensure the TPS Report Set and POLFS transaction
stream are used for this purpose.

Fujitsu Services will generate three daily TPS exception reports (TPS Report Set) (from the Host and
counter reconciliation software)

NB: These reports are not delivered to Post Office Ltd, however they can be provided for audit
requirements if required.

1. Host Detected Transaction Control Errors:

This report shows detail for any Post Office branch where the control totals for the transactions
output by the host to POLFS and POLMIS do not match the daily transaction totals calculated by the
counters.

2. IPS Harvester Errors:

This report lists error conditions detected by the TPS Harvester when failing to process a transaction
where one of the transaction message attributes is corrupted or incomplete within the Riposte
message store.

3. Incomplete POLFS Summaries

This report identifies all Post Office branches on a daily basis in which the net total of transactions
(debits/credits) does NOT net to a value of zero.

NB: It is not intended that this document describes the format or content of the individual reconciliation
reports

The TPS Report Set will be made available to Fujitsu, on a daily basis by 08.00hrs, where they will be
checked for completeness and accuracy of content. In the event that the reports do not arrive, or after
checking appear to be incorrect, in the sense that the reporting process in itself has failed, Fujitsu will
raise an incident via Post Office Account Third line support (SSC).

A BIM report will be issued to POL Finance where appropriate, i.e. where there has been a reporting
error (the reconciliation reports are flawed but not the transaction stream), or in cases where ‘delayed
transactions’ can be delivered later with out compromising the integrity of those transactions.

It is not intended that Fujitsu will deliver any of the TPS Report Set to POL Finance. An extract from the
TPS Report Set may however be delivered as ‘evidence’ as an attachment to the BIM report / MER if it
is considered by Fujitsu that this would aid the reconciliation or settlement process within POL Finance.
However, the reports can be delivered to POL Finance upon request.

5.2 Reconciliation and Incident Handling

5.2.1 Incident Originators

It is envisaged that Business Incidents will only be generated by the following groups within Fujitsu and
POL Finance:

e Reconciliation Service for errors reported via the TPS report set

e POL Finance for any other reconciliation or settlement error discovered by POL Finance that
has not been reported by Reconciliation Service

e Fujitsu SSC, for any system fault, file or transaction rejection which cannot be repaired
electronically or data base adjustment which is considered by Fujitsu Services to have a
reconciliation or settlement implication within Post Office Ltd.

Subject to agreement by the parties to the contrary, Post Office branch raised calls to the HSD will not
generate Business Incidents. However calls from Post Office branches will be monitored and if it is
considered necessary by Fujitsu Services, difficulties reported to the HSD, either directly or via the Post
Office Ltd Network Business Support Centre (NBSC), will be elevated to Business Incident status.

5.2.1.1. Generation of Business Incidents by POL

In line with the generic incident management policy agreed between Fujitsu and Post Office Ltd,
Business Incidents will only be recognised as such if generated by POL Finance, as appropriate, via the
HSD. This ensures that the Business. Incident is properly logged, enabling Fujitsu to ensure that
corrective information can be supplied and any underlying system fault can be rectified.

In all cases Fujitsu will raise a ‘BIM' report to log incidents. All such BIM reports will have a unique
identifier. This ID will mimic the Fujitsu PEAK reference however the BIM report will always contain any
other relevant references as required.

It is important that POL Finance supply sufficient information to the HSD when generating a Business
Incident to ensure the timescales for the resolution of Business Incidents referred to in section 5.3.5 can
be achieved. Achievement of such timescales is dependent upon the following information being
provided by POL Finance when generating a Business Incident via the HSD:

« A vvalid ‘PATH’ code must be quoted, e.g. ‘PATH110’ etc.

e Prefix all narrative with ‘This is a Business Incident for Reconciliation Service, PLEASE
ROUTE THIS CALL TO EDSC’

e A full description of the issue, i.e. particular Branch(es), particular date(s), product(s), etc. The
information should be of enough detail to allow Fujitsu to progress the incident and escalate if
needed to the correct support teams.

Where POL Finance raise a Business Incident which may require a large amount of supporting
information, summary detail only may be given to the HSD and the additional information sent via e-mail
to Fujitsu. (A current contact list will be made available to POL Finance).

Reconciliation and Incident Management Joint Working

oO
FUJITSU Document

Commercial in Confidence

The BIM system has been designed to report the progress to resolution of a Business Incident to allow
Post Office Ltd to complete an accurate reconciliation or settlement with their clients. For ease of
identification and association with the corresponding HSD/ PEAK call, BIM report references the unique
PEAK reference.

e A BIM Report will be issued for each Business Incident generated via the HSD (by POL) or the
PEAK incident tracking system (by SSC). As part of that BIM report, a MER is also issued for
each error associated with the relevant Business Incident where it is necessary.

e BIM Reports / MER are designed to notify POL Finance of the detail required to assist in the
reconciliation or settlement process within POL Finance. They communicate information
concerning the resolution of the symptom of an underlying cause, not the cause itself.

5.3.2 I Clearance Criteria & Charges Applicable to MER

Reconciliation Service anticipates that it will provide information concerning Business Incidents to POL
Finance on a ‘drip feed’ basis, by issuing updated versions of the initial BIM Report / MER. On a monthly
basis, the MER spreadsheet is populated by Fujitsu with details of chargeable and non chargeable errors
together with the appropriate supporting information. This is then forwarded to Post Office Ltd,
Operations Control for approval. For the avoidance of doubt, transactions or transaction corrections
which are delivered by Fujitsu to POLFS via file transfer are NOT chargeable. Transactions or
transaction repairs which are delivered manually to POL Finance via a BIM report are chargeable as
defined in section 5.3.3

ABIM Report is ‘Cleared’ when Fujitsu has provided the information required to enable full reconciliation
to take place, i.e. provide transaction detail, provide actions for POL Finance to undertake to correct a
customer's bank account, etc.

Post Office Ltd Operations Control will agree with Fujitsu on a monthly basis any payments it considers
are payable to Post Office Ltd (as compensation for Post Office Ltd costs in dealing with MER).

5.3.3 MER Charges

To clarify, S80 brings about much simplification with chargeable errors. As the Cash Account no longer
exists, having been replaced by the Branch Trading Statement, the only remaining chargeable aspect is
in respect to individual transactions. These are only chargeable to Fujitsu if they have been corrupted in
some way when delivered through a fault in the Horizon system or the related Fujitsu processes, i.e. an
OBC issue where transactions are stranded when an outlet is not closed correctly, with charges based
upon the following criteria and applicable to POLFS only and not POLMIS:

e £100 per transaction which can not be delivered to POLFS by electronic means and this has
been discovered before it was due to be sent to POLFS (i.e. it has not been rejected by POLFS)

e £150 per transaction which can not be delivered to POLFS by electronic means and this has
been discovered after it has been sent to POLFS (i.e. it has been rejected by POLFS)

In cases where transactions are lost due to fire, flood, or Post Master interference Fujitsu will not accept
liability.

MER are delivered to Post Office Ltd Operations Control on a monthly basis for agreement by 10"
working day of the following month. It is expected that in these exceptional cases that all issues will be
addressed on a case by case basis.

5.3.4 Report Distribution

Fujitsu will distribute BIM reports / MER using the Fujitsu corporate mail network. In the event that
Fujitsu corporate mail system is unavailable, Fujitsu will discuss with POL Finance the appropriate
means of information transfer.

5.3.5 Reporting Timescales

Reconciliation Service will use reasonable endeavours to raise an initial BIM report relating to a new
Business Incident. This will be made available to POL Finance, on the same working day as the
Business Incident is generated via the HSD or on the PEAK system where applicable. In the event of the
TPS Report Set not being available to Fujitsu Services in time to enable any errors to be notified within
this timescale, Fujitsu will contact POL Finance to agree a temporary extension to the timescale. This
initial, incomplete, BIM report will serve to notify POL Finance that a Business Incident has occurred and
that the completed BIM report will be provided to POL Finance within the agreed timescales.

Reasonable endeavours will be used to ensure the final completed BIM report / MER is cleared within
five working days Service Level Target (SLT) from the date the Business Incident was generated via the
HSD, or the PEAK system.

If the BIM report / MER is not cleared, or Fujitsu think it is unlikely to be cleared within five working
days, Fujitsu shall immediately notify POL Finance and shall procure that Fujitsu Manager (or in his
absence, his deputy) is made available to discuss with POL Finance to discuss the delay within two
working days of such notification.

There is no strict timescale for the resolution of a System Incident as the time taken to develop a fix or
correct erroneous reference data cannot be determined. Obviously however, Fujitsu will give every
System Incident the priority it deserves taking into account Post Office Ltd requirement and would aim to
deliver an initial analysis of the root cause within 5 working days and a final analysis and evidence of
remedial action, within 10 working days. It is clear that at all times the relationship between Incident
Management and Problem Management is clearly understood, and if need be escalations through
Problem Management will happen to hasten the rectification of the system incident.

5.3.6 Repairing Data

Where Fujitsu corrects errors, ONE Business Incident will be raised to cover each error, which has been
corrected, or group of errors if they are related to each other. A BIM report containing appropriate
information will be issued relating to that error or group of errors.

Where there is a need to correct errors, Fujitsu may make corrective assumptions, based upon the
format and content of previous valid records of the same type, if no other detail is available. For
example, where a transaction mode is unknown, the mode used may be obtained from a previous
transaction of the same type. In such cases, Fujitsu will promptly inform POL Finance of the assumption
within the working day that the assumption has been made. POL Finance may wish to review and
validate these assumptions on a case-by-case basis and it should be noted that any assumptions made
would not necessarily set a precedent.

5.4 Links to Problem Management

The processes highlighted within this document are not intended to replace the current agreed Problem
Management procedures, which will run side by side with the incident management process, as has
always been the case.

By way of example, “problems” may be raised by Fujitsu or Post Office Ltd in the following scenarios:
« Where there is a trend of similar Business Incidents where there is no identifiable cause.

« Where a System Incident has been raised and the cause is unknown.

Problem management expands the scope of the incident management process described in this
document to include any wider issues, which must be dealt with in order to rectify problems and to
ensure that the associated Business and / or System Incidents are not repeated.

A System Incident is generated by Fujitsu to ensure the relevant code or fix etc. is developed, tested and
delivered to the live estate. However, resolution of problems which arise as a result of that System
Incident will cover any additional requirements of both parties e.g. Operational Focus updates; briefings
etc. and in many case the authority from Post Office Ltd to proceed with a relevant fix.
