CC: William.Gibson;

We should get the final word, though we've been pretty accommodating of POL's changes
to keep Alice and Paula happy (not sure it's 100% worked but they seem to be less
concerned than they were). Publication will be on Wednesday at 9.30am on the BIS
website, with a press notice to accompany it (draft attached). Then the DPM and Norman
Lamb can mention it in their speeches at the employee ownership summit that morning.

Thanks
Katie

Ok thanks think it is ok how you have done it. Presumably you guys get the final word?
What's the timing did you say?

Very quickly to run past you two changes to the response:

1. Cabinet Office have added to the foreword the congruence of this
mutualisation with the Open Services White Paper:

The support we have received for a mutual model gives me confidence
that it can deliver effective and efficient services upon which individuals
and communities can depend. This is why mutualisation is at the heart
of the Government's Open Public Services Agenda.

I puts words into Norman's mouth but seems pretty anodyne...

2. On Susannah's point about the autonomy of the board - or lack
thereof given their subjection to company law - POL really wants
something about their autonomy to manage... So I've amended the
passage to read:

The Post Office is undergoing major change, with the conversion of
over half of its branches to new Local and Main network models by
2015 and the development of new revenue streams. The autonomy of
the newly established Board to manage that process and deliver the
commercial sustainability on which a transfer to mutual ownership
depends will be essential. And meanwhile, the Post Office will continue
to rely heavily on public subsidy, so that Board must remain directly
accountable to Government as owner and guardian of the public’s
interest.
