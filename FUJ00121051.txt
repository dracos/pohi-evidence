We receive heads up for issues, but didn’t receive
anything for the call on the slow running ISDN
issue. Similarly, we would appreciate more regular
updates on progress with incidents. I felt that the
Live Service were kept out of the loop. It is re-
assuring that the corrective actions planned will
address our concerns.

The comments and suggestion for improvements
have been noted. Corrective actions are already in
place to address the concerns raised.

Engineering Service: Scorecard FUJITSU
The scorecard reflects the progress we are Engineering Scorecard

making. I am very pleased with the working

relationship, which is one of the strongest I have 5

with Fujitsu.

While driving engineering to conform to the 4.8 ?

Service Levels I am pleased with the level of 46

commitment I currently see from Fujitsu working

with its suppliers. Looking to the future it's key 4.4 ~~~

that as a team we drive forward the Service 4.2

Improvements such as Crown Self Fix and BCR. .

But now is also the time we should take a serious 4

look at the potential of Fujitsu offering 38

differentiated service for engineering. I will be .

working with Fujitsu to investigate further the 3.6 OOo
proposals agreed in August. 3.4

The scorecard reflects the strong working 3.2

relationship that we have with POL. 3 I

Whilst we are first to accept that there is still some x x x

way to go in achieving the engineering SLTs, we we ys’ s SS & oe oy &
do feel that we are quick to demonstrate to POL ye

that we are always looking to introduce proactive

measures that can help improve the end to end

Base Unit MTBF is improving and is only fractionally below the levels back in April 2006

Base lining meeting has taken place between POL and Fujitsu and MTBF figures agreed post HNG-X for
all products except Epson and CTX

Escalations (Risk/Issue etc)

MTBF Penalties are currently being seen on Epson Printers, Pin Pads and Oki Printers
The previous three months has seen a considerable decrease in the MTBF of the CTX Flat screen,
significant because of the re-base lining taking place and the 20% degradation remaining in place for

12,000 screens due to POL’s decision not to purchase new

Epson labels are not being withdrawn from service and this will result in continued MTBF failure below

the threshold for excess call charges to be levied (Subject to Commercial conversations)

There is currently a problem in identifying if a KEL has been used or not for a
call; this is being followed up with Information Direct to resolve.

Engineer Recommendations:
Further Assistance from Engineering required to analyse repeat visits

PM Kit Knowledge:
The improvement activity now needs further assistance from Engineering
and the Customer to ensure all necessary factors are considered.

Crown Self Fix:

Several options have been presented for roll out which need to be agreed by
the working group. This will effect the impact of cost and the realisation of
benefit over the next year.

All of the Hardware knowledge articles (KELs) have been reviewed and
consolidated and are now with an engineer to sense check and suggest additional

guidance and fixes that can be conducted over the phone.

The skills on the entire desk have been reviewed , benchmarked and populated

into a matrix which will be used to track development in regards in First Time fix .

The repair codes have been reviewed and improved analysis of calls directed to

engineering. The new codes are currently under review for October with analysis
occurring weekly; October results will be reviewed and we expect ‘shift left’
opportunities to be identified in November.

The potential call volume to shift left for OKI Printers has been identified and
the possibility of preventative maintenance (including Health and Safety) is now being

explored.

The actions identified to resolve the issues around engineer recommendations are
approaching conclusion and data is being gathered to communicate the benefits

The area in which recommendations are displayed has been changed to reflect
what the Engineers can see on their PDAs.

The access times and correct product code activities have been launched with
the desk to improve agent understanding and adherence.
This activity has prompted further analysis of the repeat visits to identify new types of

demand following the change in the service environment since January.

A Business Case has now been created and reviewed internally within Fujitsu
and by the working group (involving the customer).

A Change Request has also been approved by POL to support implementation
and we are now in the final stages of approval to launch this activity.

The Business Case is now complete and is under review with the working
group (including the customer reps) and internally with Fujitsu. Once this has
been approved a decision will be made to identify the implementation date and

approach.

The supporting activities are reaching completion with the majority of

documentation created and final reviews underway.

The Core Team have taken part in a series of workshops to analyse the end to end
process and identify key issues to address. Actions are currently underway to
clarify certain points raised and ensure we have all of the appropriate facts before
we proceed to identifying solutions.
