Alwen Hugh and I it was Lesley as well but she has gone to the House of Parliament to help brief Jo S - also Angela is
around so will try and get her to help.

BIS - have asked for data so we are pulling that together for the briefing. Later this pm would be best

Thanks - do you mean everyone is, as there are multiple angles? If so, that's great, when would be a good time
for a call?

Mark, thank you for this.

All, if you could do something similar - half a dozen points on what you think we need to do
next, re., your own areas and overall. It will help define next steps. See below.

Susan, re., point one below - do you have a proposal/something in writing as to what the next
legal steps are, or is this referring to the general conversation last week re the external lawyers
code of disclosure?

I spoke with Alice this morning: as I expected (and rightly) Alwen and I need to give an oral

update to the Board tonight and she would like a paper tabled and discussed next week at the
Board meeting.

I will call Alwen shortly and then I expect we will need a next steps conference call this pm - but
will confirm after the call.

All

Some thoughts on next steps.

1. As well as the three initiatives we need something else which can somehow
resolve one way or another the suggestion of miscarriages of justice. In addition

to the legal process Susan has outlined.

2. SS will have to be involved: they have positioned themselves with the MPs as
crucial independent voice.

3. We need to find ways of supporting them in areas where thry do not have
expertise, particularly as the report is now more about training and support than

Horizon issues.

4. That support needs to look with them at all the cases brought by MPs and JFSA
and reach conclusions by autumn.

5. Do we then need to resource independent team alongside SS, headed by a QC
or some such to produce the final report?

6. During period between now and autumn we need to offer meetings with the
likes of Jo Hamilton and others, and develop a comms strategy for the BBC.

All just views and thinking aloud but hope helpful.
