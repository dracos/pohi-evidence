Parker Briefing [BD-4A.FID26859284]

Hi Jane, Patrick & Rod,
Please find attached, for comment:

1. Draft Briefing for Tim Parker — Andy Parsons’ Track Changed version in WORD.

2. Draft version for Tim Parker — Andy Parsons’ Track Changed version in PDF for those viewing it on phones and
IPads.

3. Email from Andy explaining why the reasons given for underpinning the legal advice received (para 13) are
intentionally vague.

I have attached track changed versions of the draft briefing so that the copy list can see Andy’s reasoning for why some
text is written the way it is and also the concerns he has around any briefing to BIS lawyers.
