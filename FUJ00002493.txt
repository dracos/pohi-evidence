FUJITSU Agreement for Operational Business Change - Product

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

2 = Introduction

This document is a Contract-Controlled Document (CCD).

2.1 Intent of Interface Agreement

The intent of this Interface Agreement is to establish effective co-operation between Fujitsu Services
and Post Office Ltd for the timely efficient and cost effective delivery of Operational Business
Change using Reference Data to HNG-X enabled Post Office counters.

This Agreement covers both Product and Branch Reference Data.

This Interface Agreement identifies:
e Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services requirement for changes introduced via Reference Data,

« the agreed end-to-end service solution for Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd, both separately
and jointly, for implementing such changes and

e the obligations of both parties, both separately and jointly, that must be met in order to deliver
the solution.

There are a number of documents (which are not CCDs) that describe the interfaces and
agreements made between Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd for the management of Operational
Business Changes. This document provides an “umbrella” agreement for those and they will comply
with the agreements made within this Interface Agreement.

Whilst this Interface Agreement serves as an umbrella for other documentation it cannot supersede
any contractual obligations defined within the Contract. The timescales shown later in this document
are those which are agreed by both parties to be operationally viable and as such form the basis of
normal business practice when implementing changes to Reference Data.

2.2 Maintenance of this Interface Agreement

This Interface Agreement is applicable the HNG-X system. It will be reviewed for any future major
software release and on an on-going basis. It is maintained by Fujitsu Services on behalf of both
parties.

2.3 Future Developments

Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services agree to work jointly to improve the quality and effectiveness of
the Reference Data interface as follows:

e Review the functionality, scope and effectiveness of the Reference Data test environment and
enhance where appropriate.

e Continuously monitor the toolset available in the test environment, in particular the Reference
Data comparison tool for identifying impact of planned Reference Data changes with the
possibility of enhancement where appropriate.

e Continuously monitor and where necessary improve the Reference Data Change Catalogue
(RDCC) relating to Reference Data requirements.

e Review the consolidated set of Business Rules and procedures which have been jointly
developed and implemented.

* Continuously improve the scope and effectiveness of Business and System tests.

e Identify risks to the Reference Data service and take remedial action to eliminate or mitigate
such risks.

The programme for delivery of each of the above will be overseen by the RDORF.

2.4 Service Management Policy

Service Management Policy is described in document SVM/SDM/SD/0007 - Service Management
Service: Service Description

2.5 Alerting when product data is at risk of late delivery

When it is known that Reference Data for Product changes may be at risk of non delivery by the time
it is required at branches (the Effective Date) it may be necessary to alert parts of Post Office Ltd so
that the relevant staff (branch, helpdesk etc.) are made aware that a required change may not be
present when expected. The only time this is a potential problem is if the data has been released the
day before it is due to become effective and there are then problems in the overnight processing
and/or delivery of the data. In practice the majority of Reference Data is released at least two days
before it is due to become effective and therefore there is only a small risk of an issue arising.

The principles of the process with respect to data being delivered overnight to become active at
branches the following day are:

e to provide warning to relevant parties in Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services, that there is
risk of critical reference data not being available at branches the following day

e to allow appropriate contingency to be invoked against that risk where lack of the data
would cause critical problems

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

The process follows the following stages:

e POLRDT (Bracknell) would indicate to SSC (on the authorisation form) that Post Office Ltd would
wish to be informed of overnight processing problems

e SSC would inform FJS duty management and data centre operations that an alert request had
been made

e In the event of overnight processing issues data centre operations would advise the FJS duty
manager of the problem and the FJS duty manager would then advise the Post Office Ltd duty
manager

2.6 Contractual obligations with respect to NBS

The contract for supply of the Network Banking Service included a number of contractual obligations
which have been carried forward into this document.

2.6.1 Extensibility

The NBS shall support, through changes to or the introduction of appropriate Reference Data, the
introduction and removal of new instances of and changes to each of the items (marked as suffix
NWB) shown in Appendix B: Standard Changes — Details. The parties may agree to vary the
allocation of the items from time to time, such variation to be documented by Fujitsu Services in the
working document entitled “Reference Data Change Catalogue” (RD/CCL/001).

2.6.1.1 Introduction and Change
The introduction of changes to and new instances of items specified above in 2.6.1

(a) shall be effected using only the agreed functions and processes used for introduction of
and changes to reference data for those Post Office Services existing at the time of
introduction of the NBS into this Agreement.

(b) shall not cause to be exceeded:

(i) any limit or range in respect of any such item (including, without limitation, limits
or ranges on the number of IINs) where such limit or range is specified in the
CCD entitled “Horizon Capacity Management and Business Volumes”
(PA/PER/033); and/or

(ii) if no such limit or range is specified in that CCD then a reasonable limit or range

2.6.1.2 Verification of NBS Reference Data

Post Office Ltd shall be responsible for verifying all NBS related Post Office Reference Data for use
in End to End Banking, save to the extent that Fujitsu Services is obliged to do so (for the purposes
of the use of such Post Office Reference Data within the Post Office Service Infrastructure) in
accordance with paragraph 2.6.1.1 above. For the avoidance of doubt, the Change Control
Procedure shall be used if Post Office Ltd requires, in connection with the introduction of any of the
items referred to in paragraph 2.6.1 above, Reference Data validation or testing of the NBS (or any
element thereof) outside the scope of this Interface Agreement.

3 Scope

3.1 Interfaces

This Interface Agreement covers all the interfaces between Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd that
support the Operational Business Change process for pre-defined Product and Branch changes.

Interface Interface Interface

Fujitsu Fujitsu
Post Office Sevics Post Office Sevices
Ltd process I poe I Ltd process I pee

“This step is not
needed if change is
pre-authorised

The start is the point where an OBC form has been completed and issued within Post Office Ltd, and
the end point is where the Reference Data has been released within Fujitsu Services for delivery to
the live counters.

The delivery of the Reference Data to counters, following release authorisation, is covered by the
SLT (see section 3.2).

This Interface Agreement applies to both Product and Branch Changes where:

e a Basic Product Change and HelpDesk Branch Change is a change which consists solely of
Reference Data which requires no additional Fujitsu Services actions and may be submitted to
Fujitsu Services without notice

* an Advanced Change Product Change is a change which requires additional Fujitsu Services
activity and is subject to advanced notification

e an Advanced Branch Change is a change which is subject to advanced notification

Note: Reference Data for Branch Change is usually necessary to support activities such as: a new
Branch Opening, a Branch Relocation, conversion of a Branch franchise, a Branch Closure.
Reference Data also supports changes to branch details such as: opening hours, telephone number,
name and address but excludes the addition or removal of individual counters. The specific activity
for branch change is described in document SVM/SDM/STD/0001 - Fujitsu Services / Post Office Ltd

3.2 Service Level Target

The contractual provisions and service level targets relating to the distribution of Reference Data to
Branches are defined in SVM/SDM/SD/0013 — Reference Data Management Service: Service
Description section 2.3.5.

3.3 Operational Business Change processes for
Reference Data Change

The Operational Business Change (OBC) process for Reference Data is defined in document
SVM/SDM/PRO/0027 - Process for Operational Business Change - Reference Data and the types of
change that qualify for the OBC process are defined in the Reference Data Change Catalogue
(RDCC). Changes not found in the RDCC must be requested via the normal Change Control
Procedure.

A summary of the process is given below.

Note:

Not every Change Type follows every step of the process see section 4.2.
The timescales for each stage of the process are defined in section 4.2.
The types of change that the process applies to are defined in section 4.2.

The responsibilities of each party are defined in section 9.

Note: the diagram and description refers to the process for Operational Changes once any required
agreement has been reached regarding the viability of the change (as may be the case with
APOP/ADC changes)

3.4 Operational Business Change processes for Branch
Change

The process for effecting changes at branches is fully described in SVM/SDM/STD/0001 - Fujitsu
Services / Post Office Ltd Operational Business Change — HNG-X Branch Interface Agreement. In
some cases there will be a need for Reference Data to support the physical changes at branches
(e.g. temporary closure for refurbishment). In some cases there will be a need to change Reference
Data when there is no physical work required (e.g. change of opening times).

Whilst the definitive process is in SVM/SDM/STD/0001 it is worth noting the general steps within this
document:

Post Office Ltd submit Reference Data via MDM to RDMC

Fujitsu Services produce reports and send them to the relevant Post Office Ltd unit
Fujitsu Services release the data no earlier than 48 hours after receipt

Post Office Ltd check reports and if errors are found submit a fresh change

oF ONS

Should Post Office Ltd find an error during the 48 hour window a direct request to Fujitsu (usually
by telephone) may be made to stop the release of the data. In this instance the release is no
longer pre-authorised and becomes a change which requires authorisation

Note: Reference Data for branch temporary closures is only sent by Post Office Ltd to Fujitsu when
the temporary closure is expected to exceed 10 days.

4 _ Types of Change

4.1 Introduction

Change types are pre-defined for inclusion into the OBC — Reference Data process. This definition
can be found in the Reference Data Change Catalogue (RDCC). Each pre-defined change type is
grouped as shown in the table in section 1.

The RDCC Product Change categories that apply to these changes are listed in sections 4.2.1 and
4.2.3 below. The assumptions listed in the RDCC must be adhered to, in order to apply these
categorisations.

Change types for Branch Changes are defined in SVM/SDM/STD/0001.

4.2 Product Changes

4.2.1. Standard Changes

The order of the change types in this section is significant and is an indication of the level of risk with
each type and therefore the amount of checking that is deemed to be necessary. The change types
are of varying risk from those which need little or no checking, as the effect of an error would be
minimal on the Live estate, to those which need extensive checking, as the effect of an error may be
significant on the Live estate. Those changes, which are deemed to require minimal or no checking,
are classified as Basic - Pure. Those changes, which are deemed to require most checking, are
classified as Advanced — Complex or Advanced Complex Extended.

A complete list of changes applicable to each type is held within the RDCC. Should Post Office Ltd
decide that additional checking is required a change may be submitted in a type with a higher risk
position in this section. However the converse is not true, in that a change can never be requested
with a lower risk position than the type shown in the RDCC.

Appendix A: Standard Changes - Details, shows a representative list of the changes for each type.

4.2.1.1 Basic - Pure

Basic Changes do not require advanced notification from Post Office Ltd to Fujitsu Services (OBC
form). The delivery of the Reference Data file using agreed mechanisms is the request for change.
The file must identify that its contents are Basic Pure changes. The file may contain more than one
change of the same type. All Basic files contain only Class 1 Reference Data items. Fujitsu Services
checks the contents of the file are appropriate for the type of change. Pure changes do not require
verification and are pre-authorised for release.

4.2.1.2 Basic — High Risk

Basic Changes do not require advanced notification from Post Office Ltd to Fujitsu Services (OBC
form). The delivery of the Reference Data file using agreed mechanisms is the request for change.
The file must identify that its contents are a Basic High Risk change. The file may contain more than

one change of the same type. All Basic files contain only Class 1 Reference Data items. Fujitsu
Services checks the contents of the file are appropriate for the type of change. High Risk changes
require a Verification and a Comparison report (where appropriate) and authorisation by Post Office
Ltd before release.

4.2.1.3 Advanced Simple

Advanced Simple changes require advanced notification from Post Office Ltd to Fujitsu Services (an
OBC form) to request the change. Associated Reference Data files must be identifiable as such
through the BCR number. Fujitsu Services checks the contents of the file are appropriate for this
type of change. Fujitsu Services has actions to take to implement the change (in addition to
processing the Type A Reference Data file from Post Office Ltd) e.g. update documentation, but
these actions can occur after the change has been released and therefore do not extend the lead-
time for the change. These changes require a Verification and a Comparison report and authorisation
by Post Office Ltd before release.

4.2.1.4 Advanced Standard

Advanced Standard changes require advanced notification from Post Office Ltd to Fujitsu Services
(an OBC form) to request the change. Associated Reference Data files must be identifiable as such
through the BCR number. Fujitsu Services checks the contents of the file are appropriate for this
type of change. Fujitsu Services has actions to take to implement the change (in addition to
processing the Type A Reference Data file from Post Office Ltd) e.g. process Type B files, and these
actions must occur before the change has been released, therefore the lead-times are longer than for
Simple or Basic changes. These changes require a Verification and a Comparison report and
authorisation by Post Office Ltd before release

4.2.1.5 Advanced Complex

Advanced Complex changes require advanced notification from Post Office Ltd to Fujitsu Services
(an OBC form) to request the change. Associated Reference Data files must be identifiable as such
through the BCR number. Fujitsu Services checks the contents of the file are appropriate for this
type of change. Fujitsu Services must generate Type C, Type F or Type X Reference Data as
appropriate to implement the change and then test that the change works as requested in the OBC
form. These changes require a Verification and a Comparison report and authorisation by Post Office
Ltd before release.

4.2.1.6 Advanced Complex Extended

This category of change has been introduced to differentiate from ordinary Advanced Complex
changes as the lead-time is longer to allow for additional validation/verification which is necessary
because of the additional complexity of the change. In all other respects this category is identical to
Advanced Complex.

4.2.2 AP (including ADC and APOP)

AP changes are similar to Advanced Complex changes and require notification from Post Office Ltd
to Fujitsu Services (an OBC form) to request the change. Associated Reference Data files must be
identifiable as such through the BCR number. Fujitsu Services checks the contents of the file are
appropriate for this type of change. Fujitsu Services has actions to take to implement the change
e.g. test Tokens and supply test files to the appropriate Post Office Ltd Client for Post Office Ltd End
to End testing of changes. These changes require a Verification and a Comparison report, additional
testing and authorisation by Post Office Ltd before release.

Change client name (new token data)

ADC changes are implemented using the same basic process mechanisms as AP although the timing
may differ.

Notes on AP/ADC and APOP change:

e Changing AP/ADC product details when an end-to-end test file is not required falls outside the
category of AP change and is to be treated in the same way as any other product change

* Ceasing AP/ADC Client, product or token when the service is Live, i.e. it is not being withdrawn
from a current CTO/ADC cycle, is to be implemented as an Advanced Simple change, with the
client service list being amended after the event

e APOP/ADC changes may affect the transaction flow on the counter and the content (including
XML tags by use of an ADC data type with ZZ_IncFields attribute) of client files. It is also
possible that incoming client files (submitted via the EDG gateway) may have similar effects.
For this reason APOP/ADC changes may be subject to advance notification to and agreement
from Fujitsu Services that the effect of the change is acceptable to Fujitsu Services.

4.2.3 Fast-track changes

4.2.3.1 Basic Express

A Basic Express change is a subset of Basic High Risk changes and must comply with the definitions
in section 4.2.1.2. However, the lead-times (see section 5.9) specified for a Basic Express change
can only be achieved where verification can be performed on the basis of the Verification Report and
not a Comparison Report. The type of change must be such that there is minimal risk of error
occurring elsewhere within the system as a result of applying the change and is therefore limited to:

Change price of non-value stock

Change price of revaluable value stock *

Change min/max quantity/value

Change Long/ Medium / Short name

Add/Amend/Cease End of Session prompt

Add/Amend/Cease Transaction prompt

Add/Amend branch exclusion for urgent suspension

products or to meet the requirement for Tight Timescales

% only OBCs that must be active on completion of the change within 48hrs =

© OBCs must be received by Post Office Ltd RDT (Bracknell) by 10am on a working

only normal volumes of change as defined in (section7.1)

© the BCR must start with prefixes as defined in CS/PDN/108. If a Change is delivered to
Fujitsu Services with this prefix but the contents do not meet the specified criteria it will be
processed according to the normal lead-times. Fujitsu Services will inform Post Office
Ltd using the incident process.

* Note: When a Basic High Risk change is to change the price of revaluable value stock, counters
will prompt counter staff on each of the three calendar days prior to when revaluation will need to
be performed, provided that the Reference Data is already at the counter. Should a similar
change be put through the Basic Express mechanism, this prompting period may be for less than
three calendar days. It is Post Office Ltd's responsibility to provide any additional notification
required to users.

nm Where the change is as described above, the requirement for completion within 48hrs may be
extended, if required, to allow for this 3 calendar day period.

4.2.3.2 Migration Special

A Migration Special change is a specific subset of Basic Pure changes and must comply with
the definitions in (section 4.2.1.1). Migration Specials are pre-authorised for release and no
verification is required.

Migration Special changes are additions or removals to the Reference Data defining which non-
core products a particular branch can or cannot sell. This Reference Data is needed so that the
correct range of Products is available at the branch

Note: The term ‘Migration Special’ was originally used during the roll-out of the Horizon system
and although it has no specific meaning in the context of the system today it is still well
understood within users of the Reference Data change process and hence the name remains for
this category of change.

The limits for use are:

© additions to Non-core Product to Branch mappings only

© Reference Data must be received by Fujitsu Services by 10am for release to be actioned
on the day of receipt or a phone call is required before 4 p.m. requesting a later file to be
released

Migration Specials differ from the standard Basic Pure change for adding non-core associations
to a branch by virtue of:

© the urgency with which the data needs to be delivered to the branch.
© Migration Specials refer to one branch or one product — the normal Basic Pure change
may have any combination of products and branches.

Where possible Post Office Ltd should use the Basic Pure change for addition of non-core
association records.

Once Fujitsu Services has confirmed that the Reference Data is of the required type it will be
released to the ‘Live’ environment.

4.2.3.3 Tight Timescales

4.2.3.3.1 Requirement

Fujitsu Services recognises that there may be occasions where Post Office Ltd will be required to
implement changes to Reference Data to timescales which are outside the control of Post Office Ltd,
for example changes announced in the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Budget. The implementation
of Reference Data in support of such changes must be handled in a very bespoke manner. Fujitsu
Services will use reasonable endeavours to meet the requirements requested by Post Office Ltd.

4.2.3.3.2 Definition

A Tight Timescale change that cannot be processed using the normal timescales defined for such a
change. It may be caused by either:

* an emergency situation where normal lead-times cannot be adhered to because of legal
circumstances outside of Post Office Ltd control, or

e to allow Post Office Ltd to exploit commercial opportunities

*® emergency introduction of a Transaction or End of Session prompt to cover legal obligations (e.g.
Money Laundering)

Each instance of such change must be notified in writing by Post Office Ltd to Fujitsu Services and
agreed between Post Office Ltd, Head of Delivery - IT and Service and the Fujitsu Services
Customer Service Director or their nominated authorised deputies.

4.2.3.3.3 Types

Analysis by Post Office Ltd of the business requirements indicates that the types of change that
require to be actioned in Tight Timescales are:

e Price changes
« Emergency cessation of a product

e Product introduction or change where the product has been created in advance with interim
details.

a) Price Change

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

The most frequent Tight Timescale changes are price changes. These may be processed via the fast-
track Basic Express route.

b) Emergency cessation

From the CSR+ version of Horizon the ability to transact a product is controlled by the use of Item
Transaction Modes and therefore these types of changes may be processed via the fast-track Basic
Express route.

c) Product introduction or change (with interim details)

A new product (or product change) can be introduced in advance of all details being available e.g. to
meet a late-breaking business opportunity. Mandatory details should be provided initially, although
some will have interim values

eg.
* product name may be set to “test name” or other identifiably interim name

e the Branch Trading Statement mapping may be to a line marked as “temporary”

e the button for the product may not be introduced until a later date, with the product only available
to be sold by PLU initially

The “interim” product should be verified using standard processes for product change (see sections
3.3 and 5.6).

To set up the interim product the normal lead-times should be adhered to. When the interim product
cannot be set up with the normal lead-times, it will be dealt with as a high priority exception (see
section 10.3).

The interim details will be later replaced using:

« a Basic Express change for the final information relating to price and name. This must be
identifiable as part of the Tight Timescale change, and will be verified via the Verification Report
for Basic Express, before the change is released

e standard changes that occur after the go live of the product e.g. the introduction of the button, or
the change of the Branch Trading Statement mapping.

4.2.3.3.4 Limitations when information is available at a very late stage

Whilst acknowledging that Post Office Ltd may not have control over legal or governmental changes

it must
release

be recognised that the ability of the end to end process to produce, check, authorise and
Reference Data takes a finite time and therefore it may not be possible in all circumstances

to meet the requirements. To this end the following are guidelines to the limitations for Tight
Timescales changes where the information is only made available at a very late stage (e.g. 4 p.m. on
a budget day).

The time to key the data into the MDM system, extract and transmit to Fujitsu Services must
be considered (probably a minimum of 1 hour)

The time that RDMC takes to process the incoming data must be considered (approximately
30 minutes)

If counter checks at Post Office Ltd are required an absolute minimum of 2 hours is required
for SSC system processing. It is therefore likely that this time will not be available and
therefore checking of the data can only be by review of reports — minimum of 30 minutes to
produce and transmit to POLRDT (Bracknell)

The time that Post Office Ltd will take to validate reports, or view data on counters should
time be available for extract, needs to be considered (estimated as a minimum of 30
minutes)

In order to meet normal operational schedules, authorisation to release a Tight Timescales
change should be received by Fujitsu Services by 7:30 p.m.

The introduction of new items is impossible overnight. If there is a possibility that new items
will be needed their skeleton data must be set up in advance, as described above in section
4.2.3.3.3.c

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

« Changes to Type C, Type F and Type X Reference Data (e.g. for Menu Hierarchy) can only
be achieved within Tight Timescales when sufficient time is available — under normal
circumstances, where the normal lead-time is not available, a Business Critical Advanced
Change may be appropriate

e An overnight change should therefore only be of the type which amends the price or name of
items

On the basis of the above timings, the latest time for commencement for an overnight Tight
Timescales change, such as Budget announcements, to be with POLRDT for keying is 5 p.m. for a
change to be checked by report and 3 p.m. for a change to be checked by counter. Whilst these
timings are theoretically possible any error which occurs in data preparation or is discovered during
checking may affect the ability of all parties to complete the exercise. Therefore, wherever possible
more time should be given.

4.2.1.4 Live Fix

The time scale for incident correction is driven by the impact of the incident, the complexity of the
solution and the Start Date (or Agreed Date) for the change to be live at the branches. (see section
10.4)

4.2.1.5 Business Critical Advanced Change

It has been recognised that the Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd operational units have the ability,
in some circumstances, to shorten the OBC lead time without adversely impacting the success of the
change, or any other change in the system.

A Business Critical Advanced Change category has been introduced to permit operational units to
decide, where possible, to deliver change within a shorter time than the specified lead-time. BCAC
does not replace Tight Timescales but rather offers an alternative, operational, method (similar to
Basic Express) of progressing Advanced changes without the need for authorisation to be obtained at
a senior level within both Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services.

= Each instance of a Business Critical Advanced Change must be agreed by each of the groups
involved in the processing of the change (normally Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services
Reference Data Teams) before the change is submitted to Fujitsu Services for action. This must
include agreement on the effective date for the Reference Data

* The lead-time requirement for such a change must be shorter than that which would normally be
required to complete the change

= The agreed lead-time requirement must be achievable

= Any errors or modifications which occur in the delivery of such a change are likely to cause
failure to achieve the agreed lead-time

= A maximum of 1 such change is permitted within any single week and 2 such changes in any
rolling 4 week period

= RDORF may, by agreement, modify the maximum quoted above

= RDORF will review each instance of such a change to establish why it was necessary to invoke
this process (without prejudice to any business confidentiality)

4.3 Branch Changes

Note: From June 2005 all branch changes are pre-authorised. Please refer to section 3.4.

4.3.1 HelpDesk

Help Desk (HD) changes are those changes which are considered to be of very low risk in the event
that the information is incorrect (e.g. change of a phone number at a branch). They do not require
advanced notification to Fujitsu Services and provided that any file received by Fujitsu Services only
contains changes consistent with being HD then the change is considered to be pre-authorised and
will be released with no further activity.

4.3.2. Advanced

Advanced Branch Changes are mostly associated with physical activity in branches. The Reference
Data is supported by an OBC form defining the actual requirement. Reports are provided to the Post
Office Ltd unit responsible for such changes to enable them to ensure that the change is as required.

5  Lead-time for Product Changes

5.1 Introduction

The lead-times quoted in this section are the end-to-end times covering both Post Office Ltd and
Fujitsu Services activities. Each party must meet each milestone applicable to it in order that the
subsequent milestones and the end-to-end lead-times are achieved. The types of change that relate
to each category are defined in (section4.2).

These lead-times apply for the volumes given in (section7).

The lead-time runs from initiating a change until the change is Released to the live system. Delivery
to Counters following release is as described in section 3.2

Notes:

For simplicity, the models used do not show activities that occur in parallel.

day = working weekday (Mon-Fri, excluding English Public Holidays)
adow = any day of the week, includes non working weekdays (Mon-Sun)

times = latest time action can occur to meet the schedule

Where a time is given next to a milestone, the time is critical to achieving that milestone. Where the
time is not given, the default is for the handover between organisations to be complete by 8am.
Failure to achieve a milestone by the given (or default) time potentially extends the lead-time of the
change.

Whilst there are indications of the time taken at each stage of the processing these cannot be taken
to be definitive, i.e. the overall lead-time should be taken as the most significant information.

N.B. The lead-time should be used in relation to when data is required to be delivered to counters on
the Live estate, which may be earlier than the start date on the data.

6 Lead-times for Branch Changes

The lead-times for supplying Reference Data for Branch Changes are defined in document
SVM/SDM/STD/0001.

7 Volume of change

7.1 Committed volumes
The service provided by Fujitsu Services as specified within this document is constructed as follows

a) it has the capability to handle an overall maximum of 300 business as usual changes within one
month with the following limits within each of the categories

- Branch Changes 140 per month
-  Pre-Authorised Product Change 40 per month
- High Risk Product Change 50 per month
- Advanced Product Change 100 per month
- Automated Payment Change 120 per month

b) to enable Post Office Ltd to manage the volume and categorisation of changes that are supplied
into this service and to facilitate Fujitsu Services capacity management and alignment of
resources to meet these requirements for managing Reference Data changes, the framework for
a Work Index system has been agreed. The Work Index system will specify in units an indication
of the amount of work required for each file or associated activity

c) The monthly Work Index limit will be 5000 units which will be equivalent to the workflow
represented by the 300 changes and the identified constraints as specified in a) above

[DN: It has proved impossible to create a direct correlation between 300 changes and 5000 work units
due to the fact that the two figures are measuring completely different things - changes is a simple
statement of the number of individual requests whereas work units reflect the effort required. This
needs further consideration for a future release of this document]

The Reference Data Operational Review Forum will oversee the introduction of the Work Index
system and will be responsible for its continued development. The RDORF will monitor and review
the effectiveness of the process and any issues which arise from these limits.

Data, which is required specifically for the implementation of a new system release is exceptional to
these committed volumes and as such will not be counted within any measurement against this
Interface Agreement.

To ensure milestones are not put at risk all deliverables must be:

e Complete and identifiable e.g. cross referencing change numbers
e Error free (see section 10.4 for managing errors)
e Correctly dated (see section 8.3)

e Delivered by the relevant deadlines set out in the Interface Agreement (see sections 5 and 6 for
required milestones)

e Delivered through the agreed mechanisms.

8.1 Post Office Ltd to Fujitsu Services

Post Office Ltd shall deliver to Fujitsu Services:

1) Reference Data for Advanced and Basic changes
2) Operational Business Change forms for Advanced changes
3) Supporting items and/or information appropriate for changes e.g. AP tokens, Operational Focus

4) Authorisation for Advanced and High Risk Basic Product changes and Advanced Branch changes
(where appropriate)

Note: This applies to changes which are within the scope of the OBC process, i.e. following
agreement where necessary for changes such as APOP/ADC.

8.2 Fujitsu Services to Post Office Ltd

Fujitsu Services shall deliver to Post Office Ltd:

1) Reference Data direct to Live Counters, for OBCs that are pre-authorised by Post Office Ltd.
2) Reference Data to Verification Counters, for Product Change OBCs to be verified, and that:
e include Type C, Type F or Type X Reference Data for Advanced changes when necessary
e has been validated to ensure changes work as requested on the OBC forms.

3) Verification and Comparison Reports (as appropriate for Product Change) that identify exactly
what changes to the counter have been implemented

4) RDMC report (as appropriate) for Advanced Branch Changes
5) Reports to RDORF on volumetrics

8.3 Future Dating

Reference Data records contain either a ‘Start Date’ or an ‘Effective Date’ which is the date on which
the change is to become effective on the counters. Where possible this date should always be in the
future when the data is created and remain a ‘future date’ throughout processing and distribution so
that it is still a future date when it arrives at the counters.

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

However it is advisable that the future date is within the range of dates available on validation and
verification counters (currently a maximum of 12 weeks) as it may not be possible to validate/verify a
change which is further in the future. Furthermore, if the change has more than one effective date
(e.g. Remit In followed by Serve Customer) and the difference between these two dates is more than
4 weeks less than the maximum date range of verification counters (i.e. a maximum of 8 weeks
between start dates), the change should be submitted as two separate changes to allow validation of
the individual parts. Failure to do this may result in the second part of the change having to be
released before it has been validated.

There is a risk to Post Office Ltd if the OBC process is not initiated sufficiently in advance of the
Effective Date to allow for:

e the IFA lead-time for processing, validation, authorisation and release to the Live system for that
particular type of change

¢ the distribution time to branches

e additional contingency where Post Office Ltd consider the Reference Data to have business
critical importance

Where, for whatever reason, Post Office Ltd are unable to initiate the OBC process sufficiently in
advance, then Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services would establish an Effective Date to supersede
the Start Date.

Fujitsu Services reserves the right to log as a pre-live incident, the receipt of any Reference Data
which is not future dated. This is because data which has an immediate start date (i.e. any date in the
past at the time when the data reaches the counter) may have an adverse effect and may create
additional calls to HelpDesks.

The scheduling of non-future dated data by Post Office Ltd delaying authorisation of the release of
Reference Data is not an approved method.

9 Roles & Responsibilities

The primary interface for changes described in this document is between Post Office Ltd Reference
Data Team and Fujitsu Services Reference Data Team. Where other units within each of the
organisations requires an interchange with the other organisation in relation to a business as usual
change they should address their requirements via the appropriate team.

Each party accepts responsibility for those aspects of a change for which it has responsibility to test.

Post Office Ltd will accept full responsibility for the introduction of or any amendment to APOP or
ADC services or transactions where Fujitsu Services has not been made aware in advance of the
nature of the change or has been made aware and has not agreed that the change is acceptable to
Fujitsu Services.

Business tests for the purpose of verifying changes to Reference Data are conducted by Post Office

supplied by Fujitsu Services. Authorisation from Post Office Ltd to Fujitsu Services to release
Reference Data is made on the basis of these tests.

10 Orders and exceptions

10.1 Release of Reference Data

The Agreed Release Date for each change shall be set on the following principles:

1. The date by which the Reference Data is required to be effective on the counters in the live
estate is the “Effective Date”

2. Where the Authorisation Date is 10 days or less before the Effective Date the Agreed Release
Date will be no later than the next Working Day following Authorisation.

3. For the avoidance of doubt, for Tight Timescale requests in accordance with paragraph 4.2.3.3 of
this document, the Agreed Release Date shall be the same as the Authorisation Date.

4. Where the Authorisation Date is more than ten days before the Effective Date the Agreed
Release Date will be no later than the first Working Day following the tenth day before the
Effective Date

5. If there is more than one set of Reference Data which needs to be released at or about the same
time and in the view of Fujitsu Services releasing all Authorised data would impose a risk on the
delivery of some of that data, in order to achieve maximum distribution by the Effective Date:

a) the order in which Reference Data will be released will be based on business criticality of
the Reference Data, as assessed by Post Office Ltd and by agreement with Fujitsu
Services

b) a new Agreed Release Date will be agreed for any Reference Data changes which are
delayed as a result of modifying the order of release of the changes

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

e The receipt in an agreed mailbox of the OBC form is the confirmed request from Post Office Ltd
to Fujitsu Services, for Advanced Branch Changes.

«The receipt of a Reference Data file containing only Basic (Class 1 or HD Reference Data) in the
RDMC, is the confirmed request for change from Post Office Ltd to Fujitsu Services.

« The receipt of a correctly completed Authorisation Form from Post Office Ltd is the confirmed
authorisation to release the change.

e The receipt of pre-authorised change files (e.g. Migration Special, Pure Basic, HD, branch
change) clearly identified as such and containing that type of change, is the authorisation for
release of the changes.

e Requests for non-OBC changes (i.e. those not defined in the RDCC), unless agreed by all parties
in advance of any update to the RDCC, will not be accepted and need to be submitted as a
formal (non-OBC) request to Fujitsu Services. However, the change request may also initiate an
update to the RDCC so that new changes are introduced to the OBC process, where agreed. In
many cases once a formal request has been approved the delivery mechanisms will be the same
as, or similar to, those used for OBC.

10.3 Exceptions

Exceptions, e.g. to volumes or lead-times, will be processed using available resources without any
guarantee of service delivery. Both Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services shall notify the other party
when a request is recognised to be an exception.

Note: An agreed Deviation to the Service (e.g. Reference Data necessary for the implementation of a
new system release such as Network Banking) is not an exception.

Post Office Ltd may wish to change the priority of an exceptional change so that it is given
preference over normal changes. In this instance the agreed lead-times may be extended pro rata for
displaced activities.

10.4 Errors

This section relates to errors for both Product and Branch Reference Data, where appropriate.

10.4.1 Recording Pre-Live Incidents

All observed errors will be recorded as pre-live incidents in accordance with the OLAs RDS/OLA/001
and PON/OSG/OLA/001. The change will be suspended awaiting corrective action, potentially
delaying the achievement of that milestone for all changes affected by the error. For example, a file
containing records that are rejected will not be processed until the rejected records are corrected and
any other change which is in any way associated with the rejections may also be delayed. Where the
achievement of a milestone is at risk, corrective action will be taken by the appropriate party or
parties, by agreement, in order to achieve the final milestone, where possible.

A pre-live incident will be raised for late deliverables.

If the Start Date or Effective Date contained within the Reference Data record is not future dated or is
set to a date prior to the Required Date a pre-live incident may be raised i.e. the Start Date/Effective
Date is either prior to the date on the OBC form, or is not consistent with the overall lead-times (see
section 8.3).

If it is known that the final milestone will not be achieved, or an alert has been requested and the data
is being released and will become active on the following day an Alert may be necessary as
described in section 2.5.

Pre-live incidents are recorded on the Peak system used internally by Fujitsu Services Ltd. As some
Peak’s relate to work required by Post Office Ltd it is necessary for Post Office Ltd to have visibility
of Peak data. Details of the passing of information between Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd are
shown in Appendix B — Peak control between Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd.

10.4.2 Pre-live Incident Management

Pre-live incidents necessitate additional activity by all parties and as such may have an impact on
lead-times.

Appropriate steps shall always be taken to establish and eliminate the root cause. This will be
monitored by the RDORF

10.5 Escalation

Disagreements about the service e.g. whether a change is exceptional, will be raised, and wherever
possible resolved, at the RDORF. If agreement cannot be reached at the RDORF, either party may
invoke formal escalation mechanisms.

10.6 Charging

e AP Client Take-On (including ADC and APOP) is charged as specified in the Agreement
e Deviations to the service will be charged as per the Commercial Terms.

e Invoices will be raised and paid in accordance with the Agreement.

Note: The majority of changes to HNG-X reports and receipts, with the exception of ADC
receipts, can only be achieved by code changes and are therefore subject to a Change
Request. This mechanism within the OBC processes is limited to those changes which can
be made through Reference Data only and requests for such changes not currently listed in
the Reference Data Change Catalogue must be confirmed with Fujitsu Services prior to
raising the OBC. As changes of this nature are identified they will be added to the Reference
Data Change Catalogue.

exception of those noted in Basic — High Risk, will be Advanced Complex Extended. It should
be noted that in the future additional checking of Network Banking Reference Data may be
deemed to be necessary, in a similar fashion to that currently used for AP, in which case lead-
times will need further consideration.

The introduction of Chip and PIN functionality means that changes of IIN for Chip and PIN
cards now fall into this category due to the fact that IIN data is also held in the PIN Pad and
amendments to PIN Pad data require action from Fujitsu Services. Any other changes to
data held in the PIN Pad will also fall into this category.

12 Appendix B — Peak control between Fujitsu
Services and Post Office Ltd

Please note that the Peak system has replaced the previous system called PiniCL however the two
names are often used interchangeably.

This section describes the agreed mechanisms for passing Peaks from the Fujitsu Services Peak
system to Post Office Ltd and entering responses from Post Office Ltd into the Peak system. The
passing of data between the organisations is necessary because Post Office Ltd do not have direct
access to the Peak system.

The interface for all Peaks relating to Reference Data for both the Live service and data provided by
Post Office Ltd to support new facilities required by Change Request is the Fujitsu Services SSC.

All Peak’s which need to go to Post Office Ltd will be routed (Peak term) to the SSC team for onward
transmission (in practice the largest number of Peaks destined for Post Office Ltd are raised by
SSC).

When SSC receive a Peak to be sent onwards the Peak is routed to the appropriate Post Office Ltd
team. In Peak terms these teams are:

POCLRefDataRDO [issues arising from MDM system or POLRDT (Chesterfield) keying]
POCLRefDataOSG [issues arising from EPOSS data]

POCL-LRDP [issues arising during Live Reference Data Proving]
POCL-Test-Data [issues arising with data provided specifically for testing]

Please note that these identities were created when the Post Office Ltd name was POCL and the
teams were as described by the names. Whilst the company name and the individual team names
have changed the use of these Peak names will not be changed as they are for routing purposes
only.

Once the Peak has been routed within the Peak system itself SSC will create an e-mail and copy in
the contents of the Peak on to the e-mail. The subject line in the e-mail must contain the word ‘Peak’
and the number of the Peak for ease of recognition.

On a periodic basis (at least monthly) SSC will provide a listing of outstanding Peak’s to all interested
parties. RDORF monitors Peak trends and Peaks outstanding to ensure that issues are addressed in
a timely fashion.

Post Office Ltd must always explicitly respond to the Peak and not rely on the delivery of any data to
be the notification of an update to the Peak.

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

When SSC receive the explicit response, the Peak will be updated, in most cases by copying the
data in the e-mail into the Peak system. If the response indicates that no further action will be
undertaken by Post Office Ltd the Peak will be routed to the originating team. SSC will advise the
originator of the response that the Peak has been removed from the POCL stack.

Under some circumstances a Peak may be necessary to show that a problem has occurred but where
no further action is required from Post Office Ltd e.g. where a file has been sent to RDMC twice. In
order to record that the problem occurred SSC will create a Peak, route it to the relevant Post Office
Ltd team and immediately route it back to SSC and, in most cases, close the Peak. A copy of the
Peak will be sent to the relevant team in Post Office Ltd.

13 Appendix C — Reports and Receipts
documentation

With the introduction of HNG-X the original single CCD DES/GEN/SPE/0004, which held information
on all Reports and Receipts was split into 4 parts, DES/GEN/SPE/008 — HNG-X Branch and Counter
Reports, DES/GEN/SPE/0009 — HNG-X Receipts, Slips and Labels, DES/GEN/SPE/0010 — HNG-X
Banking, Debit Card and ETopUp Receipts and Texts and DES/GEN/SPE/0011 — HNG-X AP and
ADC Receipts. The last two of those documents (DES/GEN/SPE/0010 and DES/GEN/SPE/0011)
are no longer CCDs because the majority of changes that occur within them are as a direct result of
business as usual changes managed by this Interface Agreement.

Because the rate of change can be very variable, the documents are not always issued for review
and approval for each individual change however it is also essential that the people who need to use
them to make change have the latest working version available to them.

The process for update will therefore be:

>» for each amendment, or group of amendments to either document a new draft version will be
produced and lodged in the FUS Dimensions system. For information purposes a copy of this
version will also be circulated to an agreed list of recipients. This will include the Post Office
Reference Data Team in Bracknell and therefore anyone in Post Office who requires visibility
of the latest version should ensure that they contact this team.

» when the number of draft versions becomes excessive (e.g. 9) or no further amendments are
expected for the anticipated period required to gain sign off of the updated document, the
document will be sent out for formal review.
