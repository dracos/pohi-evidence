I have just received the attached from BIS. In short Alan Bates has proactively contacted the local MP with
regard to Martin Griffiths.

As a result of this I would like to contact the MP proactively to offer a meeting about the case.

I think this would need to involve Angela and Kevin, me and possibly Paula though we need to make a
judgement on that.

Please let me have any views ASAP.
Mark
