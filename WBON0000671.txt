Rob

Sorry for all this contact over the weekend...

I have had an e mail from the client at Post Office and they say:

Ideally, I would like to know today whether Lord Grabiner is supportive of the recusal application, and if so, to
what extent. Are we able to get any insight on that? Provided that he is, then we should stand up Lord
Neuberger for the Board call, and I will also be able to feedback the outcome of the meeting with Lord
Grabiner. (which could be any time from 1.30 onwards that suits him).

So I think the following issues arise:

Thanks

Tom

1) Is Lord Grabiner able to indicate today (e mail to you is fine and then you copy onto me — or direct to me
and Andy (copied)) if he is in broad agreement with the statement that he is supportive of a recusal
application needing to be made in this case and it having prospects of success. I think POL is seeking to
flush out whether lord Grabiner is broadly supportive, as Lord Neuberger was in his note, or whether he
takes a different view. If both are aligned, then there is a POL Board decision to be taken. If there is a
difference of view then we (POL and WBD) will have to think about how to guide the POL Board.

2) Assuming Lord Grabiner is in agreement broadly, then can POL GC (Jane MacLeod) and I get a call set
up after 1.30pm on Monday at a time that suits Lord Grabiner ? Jane wants to get a download so that can
be replayed to the later POL Board meeting.

3) The POL Board meeting is at 5.15pm. Lord Grabiner cannot make that. If there is broad agreement
between Lord Grabiner and Lord Neuberger then the plan would be for Lord Neuberger to be on a call with
the POL Board at that 5.15pm time slot. Can that be set up ?
