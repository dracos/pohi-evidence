A couple of comments:
Can we change the reference from Bug to fault.

Given what Andy has sent to us late Friday — were these branches disadvantaged — ie did they have to put their own
money in and if so for how long? From his summary it wasn’t clear to me.

And if they did have to put their own money in, at what point did we reimburse them and did we give them so sort of
additional payment due to inconvenience.

Thx
Gina: Can you print a copy for my SS file. Thx

Problem Description

The problem occurs as part of the process of moving Discrepancies into Local Suspense.

There was a bug, introduced as part of HNG, that in certain circumstances meant that discrepancies were not
properly cleared to Local Suspense.

This means that the gain or loss remained, unresolved, within the discrepancy account.

e If the sub postmaster did not look at their Final Balance Report carefully, they would have been unaware of this
issue.

© The impact would have been that in order to balance, sub postmasters would have to either put their own
money in (a disadvantage to the sub postmaster) or taken money out (an advantage to the sub postmaster)

This problem was automatically picked up by the system, which had been designed to flag up these type of
discrepancies

Impact to sub postmasters
e In total 62 branches were impacted
© Out of these 17 were sub postmaster branches (not crowns or multiples) who were disadvantaged

Why did it take so long to resolve?
e Priority and distinction from other service issues that were happening at the time of the HNG rollout
¢ Complexity of understanding the root cause
e¢ Getting agreement and clarity on how best to communicate this to branches
