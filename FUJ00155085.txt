Gareth - in the past you have provided very important and useful advice and assistant to me and the prosecution
team in successfully prosecuting defendants who have challenged the horizon system. I understand presently you are
providing the team with advise on the review presently being carried out by 2" sight.

I would be most grateful if you would telephone or email me urgently on your return from annual leave.

Regards
