Case History and Pleas

Those instructing act on behalf of the Post Office Ltd in connection with the Prosecution

of Mr. Khayyam Ishaq.

Mr. Ishaq appeared before the Bradford Magistrates Court on 30'* May 2012. He gave
no indication of his plea and the magistrates deemed the case unsuitable for summary
trial. © The case was adjourned for the preparation of committal papers and the
committal hearing took place on 25" July 2012. Mr. Ishaq was granted unconditional bail
until 4" September 2012. The original witness statements were handed to the court clerk

during the committal hearing.

Unusual Case Features

Counsel will find full details of the case in the papers herewith.

Before the hearing on 25" July 2012 Mr. Ishaq’s solicitor said that the case would be

contested. His client had told them that there must have been an error in the accounting

UKGI00018903

system and that the money would be in the accounts somewhere. Mr. Ishaq’s solicitor
also commented that everyone had heard about the problems with the Horizon system

and that they would probably instruct a forensic expert.

By letter of 6" August 2012 the Defendant's solicitors asked for a copy of the unused
schedule. Further copies of the Schedule of Non-Sensitive Unused Material and of the
covering letter of 12" July 2012 to which the schedule had been attached were sent by
DX on 8 August 2012. No Defence Statement has been received and nothing further

has been heard from Mr. Ishaq’s solicitors.

The officer in the case, Stephen Bradshaw, has been asked to consider whether the
Overnight Cash Holdings Data and transaction data may also be used to show that the

stamp sales reversals were not genuine.

Instructions

Counsel is instructed to represent the Post Office Ltd in connection with the prosecution
of Khayyam Ishaq and in the event of a guilty plea being entered or upon Mr. Ishaq
being found guilty, to seek compensation through confiscation proceedings and, of

course, Costs.

Should Counsel require any further information he should not hesitate to contact Martin

J Smith of those instructing.
