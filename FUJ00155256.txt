Analysis of Audit timeouts

1 Background

This paper contains the working notes from examination of the timeout events extracted from
the Horizon system between December 07 and June 08.

The Riposte message journal is used as one of the sources of diagnostic information concerning
activities that take place at the branch.

Whilst in general, applications writing to the Riposte message journal will normally be able to
write a record, there are potential cases where a write can fail. It is up to the application
software to handle the error and report this to the user.’

A recent question has been raised as to whether there may be any circumstances where records
might have been lost before being written to the journal.

Riposte has a timeout of 10 seconds on how long it will queue a write request before returning
a failure response to the calling application. Examples circumstances where a failure could
occur are as follows: An application may chose to take a lock out and write a number of
records within a single commit unit; The system may be busy performing other I/O functions
and the write cannot be completed within the timeout period.

In cases where a failure occurs, Riposte writes a “Timeout” event to the NT event log. In some

cases, the calling application also writes its own “Timeout” event. These events are forwarded
via Tivoli to the central Horizon systems management system.

Events are only forwarded by Tivoli to the audit system where they are categorised as “Error”.
Local filtering can also take place where an event has been categorised as “harmless” to
prevent large volumes swamping the central systems.

An extract of the timeout events for a 6 month period has been provided for analysis, and is the
subject of the rest of this paper

"A separate analysis of the counter application behaviour is being undertaken and is covered by a separate
paper.

2 Event texts and volumes
The events recorded cover the period 31 December 2007 and 30" June 2008. 31°

These events are filtered to those which include the string “timeout” in the message description.
[There may also be some further filtering — check with Alan Holmes.]

There were a total of 27993 events recorded, split as shown below

Grand Total 27993

In the cases where an application rather other Riposte logs the error, there is in general an
associated Riposte error event. (There are a two of cases for KMRX, where there is no
associated Riposte event — these are the 2 “RiposteGetMessage” events above and relate to reading
rather than writing, and hence no Riposte error has been logged for these.)

The KMRX, C_HV_POACK and C_HVPOSCH applications are background applications
which monitor the messages received in the counter and generate responses to be returned to
the central system. KMRX also uses Riposte to hold checkpoints of message runs. These
applications handle the errors and recover from the failure, hence these can be removed from
the analysis.

By removing these background applications and the associated Riposte events , these reduce to
a total of 11633 events recorded, split as shown below

It can be seen that there are several days where there are significant peaks in the events raised.
Specifically there were > 200 events raised on each of the following 12 days:

Date Number of Events
08/02/2008 894
18/02/2008 241
19/02/2008 312

31/05/2008 217
02/06/2008 1280
03/06/2008 636

Total 8521

This represents 73% of the Riposte Only Timeout events.

It was conjectured that the peaks may be related to Software Distribution. The attached

5 Analysis by counter

The Riposte only timeout events for this 6 month period were generated on 5179 separate
counters. That means that over 5/6" of the counters had no events in this period.

For each counter the following graph shows the numbers that had 1 or more events.

Hence approximately 40% of the events were generated from 221 counters, and over 50% of
the events were generated from 659 counters (221+122+316).

There were 19 counters (in separate branches) which experienced 40 or more events in this
period. The events recorded by these counters accounted for over 20% of the events raised.

This shows a much greater percentage related to the gateway PC, but only covers
approximately 60% of the events generated. /It may be useful to eliminate the SCO branches

10 Conclusion & Recommendations
This analysis work has shown the following:

e The Riposte Timeouts can occur at any point and impact any application that is running
on the counter.

o Some Counter Applications handle the failure response in an appropriate way
and indicate the error has occurred via their own event message.

= Over this period we have been able to eliminate as a problem well over
half of the Timeout events (down to 11633 from 27993)

o Where other Counter Applications generate an event, it does not include the
word “Timeout” within the event text.

= We need to include the results from the further analysis that has been
request from Live monitoring of these events by the SSC.

e The Riposte timeout events can occur at any times of the day or night

o There are some significant peaks on certain dates, indeed this represents 73% of
the Riposte Only Timeout events over the 6 month period!

= Further analysis needed to identify the reason for these higher volumes

of events on these specific dates, but it is unlikely that we will be able to
eliminate these.

o Even after elimination of the peak days, the profile of events is still spread
across the whole 24 hours, but more closely follows the working day.

* Hence it is likely that EPOSS transactions are being impacted and this
area needs further investigation.

© The events are seen across all counter positions, not just the Gateway PC.

= The distribution is roughly in line with the distribution of the number of
counters within the live estate.

= However, when looking purely at the events between 08:00 and 20:00,
there may be a higher impact on the Gateway PC.

e This analysis shows that the End of Day peak is significant and generates a major

proportion of the normal daily Riposte Only events once the Peak days have been
excluded.

o. The main impact is within 2 minutes of 19:00.

o. The number of events varies with the day of the week, both Monday and
Wednesday being of similar proportions.

© Over 80% of these are on the gateway PC.

= This links to the known case where the EOD process on the gateway PC
can lock other applications out for a short period from writing
messages to the Riposte journal.

e Anevent is always generated by Riposte when the timeout occurs

o There may be some events which are discarded during “event storms” — and
these conditions need to be tracked manually — unless some other event can be
detected that relates to this situation.

o The Audit query process must examine the event log to see what events have
been generated at the branch in the period covered by the ARQ. This applies to
all events, but the Riposte timeout events must be reviewed in detail.

e There are some apparent “hot spots” in individual counters and branches:
o 19 counters accounted for over 20% of the events.
© The top 20 branches accounted for 30% of the events

o Between 08:00 and 20:00, the top 20 counter are responsible for 29% of the
events.

© Between 08:00 and 20:00, the top 20 branches are responsible for 30% of the
events — but the branch list is slightly different from the top 20 counter list.

o Atend of day, the top 20 counters cover 17% of the events — though these were
not all gateway PCs.

However, this picture needs to be put into perspective!

e Even though a large number of these events are being generated, they only affect a
small percentage of the branch estate.

o For example, assuming that there are 13,000 branches and 30,000 counters, we
can calculate the potential impact on an individual branch or counter over a 6
month period as follows:

= After elimination of known other application timeout events:

Percentage for Branches Counters
No Events 72.4 82.7
Up to 1 Event 85.8 93.9
Up to 2 Events 92.4 97.8
Up to 3 Events 95.2 98.9
Up to 4 Events 96.7 99.3
5 or more Events 3.3 0.7

= During the hours Of 08:00 to 20:00, the percentages are:

Percentage for Branches Counters
No Events 92.5 96.0
Up to 1 Event 95.8 98.2
Up to 2 Events 97.4 98.9
Up to 3 Events 98.2 99.2
Up to 4 Events 98.5 99.4
5 or more Events 1.5 0.6

The analysis work, though comprehensive, is not yet complete.
e A number of areas for further investigation still need to be considered.

e A number of questions in italics within this document need to be followed up.

e The set of conclusions needs to be reviewed, and potential follow up actions needs to

be produced.

e The resources needed to complete this exercise need to be estimated and a plan agreed.
