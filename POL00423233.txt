Malcolm — can I ask you to review this and make sure that we are procuring the right service for POL.
Thanks

Hi,
The current set up is as follows:

The 'Speak Up' line is provided by a third party, In Touch (MCS) Ltd - calls are taken 24/7 and there is also a web
reporting function. In Touch send call reports (‘disclosures’) to a dedicated RMG e-mail address (I think there is also
some level of encryption).

Asmall team (approx 4 managers) in RMG Internal Audit have a rota for checking the mailbox, and prioritise the
disclosures in order of severity. Most disclosures are sent out to nominated people within the business units, and

as Susan says most calls relate to grievances or bullying and harrassment complaints. Internal Audit operate a tracker (a
simple excel spreadsheet) to keep track of who is responsible for investigating each disclosure, and to record the results
of each investigation. Limited feedback is given to callers (generally along the lines of ‘Thank you for your call; the
matter is being investigated.")

A quarterly report on calls recevied is prepared for the ARC.

This line is available to POL under an existing TSA until 31 March 2013. Very few calls are currently received on POL
matters, as the line is not well publicised.

What we need to do in POL:

Get the business case approved (Mick Gordon said he would advise who needs to sign it off)

Start the procurement process to find a replacement for the Group provided line (Michael Hallinan in procurement was
involved earlier in the year and will be able to assist)

Make contact with the relevant person in HRSC and discuss how they would manage call reports received from a third
party (In Touch or new provider) (confidentiality is paramount)

Identify the right person/people in each business unit within POL to be responsible for investigating reports (& make sure
they are aware of Public Interest Disclosure Act requirements)

Agree ideal timescales for investigating reports, and the level of upward reporting, & who is going to compile the data
(HRSC?)

Plan a comms campaign to raise the profile of the line

Let me know what you think.
Thanks,

Georgina

I had a brief chat with SC this morning. She would like us to develop the process for this activity,
cantered around HR shared service as an intermediary.

This approach has a number of advantages:

- they are independent and can act as go between for both parties anonymously

- they can filter and field complaints to relevant people (provided we supply them with an
appropriate list)

- most complaints apparently are around bullying and harassment, so as an activity this should not
be anything new to HR

Can you please appraise me of the current position in it's entirety this morning please, so that we
can progress to next steps.

Kind regards

Malcolm

Well why not keep it in Compliance until you/we see what the volume is like?

In RM there are about 4 audit managers who take turns monitoring the relevant inbox and performing a triage on
reports, along with their regular audit work. The investigations are generally carried out in the line, unless it’s a ‘the
chief exec is fiddling the books’ type of disclosure. The volume of calls to the Group line mean this is not a terribly
onerous task, so I would have thought any senior team ought to be able to take it on.

Will speak to Malcolm Z/Chris Day, with Malcolm S’s help!

Georgina — in RM this sits with Internal Audit, can you discuss with Malcolm/ Chris Day as to whether it would be better
with their team... HR have no resources to run this unless it goes to the HR Service Centre and instinctively I don’t think
that is the right place to manage this.

Hi Susan,
Sorry to chase, but I wondered if you had any opinions on this?

Hi Susan,

The time has come to procure our own disclosure line and the key thing I need to know is where do we want it to sit in
POL? Malcolm feels it sits naturally in HR. Could you let us know if you agree, and if so, who within HR?

I'd like to include whoever will be owning and running the line internally in the procurement process! The TSA for the
Group line runs out at the end of March 2013, and I have procurement lined up to start the process. We have £45k in
the budget (although I hope it won’t cost that much) and Mick Gordon tells me that we need to do a business case in
order to release the money (draft attached).

Thanks,
