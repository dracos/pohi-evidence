Dear David and Penny,
On first glance points 2 - 4 have not been answered which I reproduce below.

2) My barrister telephoned me yesterday evening and requested that I find out any information that
Fujitsu may hold in relation to an office called Callender Square in Falkirk. Apparently, Anne
Chambers a Systems Specialist employed by Fujitsu was cross examined and it is said that she had
full knowledge of an error in the Horizon system at this Post Office. Our barrister would like Gareth to
deal with this matter and expand upon whatever issue Anne Chambers raised at court within his
witness statement.

3) When Gareth completes his statement could he also mention whether there are any known
problems with the Horizon system that Fujitsu are aware of. If none could this be clarified in the
statement.

4) Could Gareth read the statement from Eleanor Nixon attached below and respond in his statement
to the points raised by Eleanor Nixon about Horizon.

Could you please give this matter your urgent attention and look forward to hearing from you.
