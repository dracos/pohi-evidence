& James 11 Sept

Hi Janet
Thank you very much indeed for your email.
Both happy to meet with James at your offices and I will make sure they call you on arrival.

Appreciate that Parliamentary business can suddenly intervene, not a problem.

Janet says JNA needs to cover off the October report with Alice Perkins (croiwill print this for him)

Hi Janet

I have put the 11th September in Alice’s diary at 9am for an hour. I will put this as confirmed in her
diary unless I hear from you to tell me otherwise, if that’s ok?

Alice will come to Westminster to see James.

It is probably better if you call Jorja and she will get a message to Alice should you need to cancel.

Thank you.

No need to send an invitation, as I shall pencil this in the diary now. I will have to confirm with you in
a couple of weeks, when I see James, but let’s hold that date and time.

Would Alice be content coming to Westminster?

I must make thee final and usual proviso that just in case Parliamentary business rears its head at the
last minute, we might have to change this tentative time at very short notice. I hope this won’t
happen, but if it does, is it best for me to call you, and you to warn Alice, or are you (and Alice) happy
for me to have her mobile number?

V’ll come back to you as soon as I have spoken to James, but this time and date look good.

Kind regards
Janet
