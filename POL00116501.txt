Dear Alan,

Your letter of 16 April to the Minister for Postal and Regulatory Affairs has been
passed to me for reply as the matters it raises are operational concerns which
are my responsibility.

Since the publication of the Second Sight interim report Post Office has worked
collaboratively with JFSA as an organisation and particularly you as its Chair to
design the Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme. The Scheme
documentation was agreed with you and put on your website. The Post Office
has remained true to the aims of the Scheme, committed substantial resource
to ensure its success and respected the confidentiality of the Working Group.
As recently as 24 March we shared a platform together to communicate the
progress that had been made under the Scheme and I was encouraged then by
your commitment to allowing the Scheme to run.

Against that background your action in sending your letter has come as a shock
and a disappointment to me. I find two things troubling:

1. The content of your letter would appear to breach the confidentiality of
the Working Group and furthermore paints a picture which is inconsistent
with the position as I understand it to be.

2. The fact that you have bypassed the structure of the Working Group to
raise your concerns.

Post Office has displayed a strong commitment to the Scheme over a prolonged
period of time. I remain committed in principle to making the Scheme work but
your letter has damaged the trust Post Office has invested in you as a member
of the Working Group.

There are a number of specific points in your letter that Post Office will need to
address and I have asked Chris Aujard to prepare a more detailed response. In
the meantime I will need to consider Post Office’s position in relation to the
Scheme over the coming days.

Yours etc
