Written Records of Tape Recorded Interviews

1. Introduction

1.1 In most circumstances following a tape recorded interview with a
suspect an Investigator will be required to prepare a written record
detailing what occurred during the interview. The purpose of the
record is to:

1.1.1 Provide a balanced, accurate and reliable record or
summary of the interview.
1.1.2 Identify possible lines of defence and mitigation.

1.1.3Assist Casework Management (CWM) to decide if a case should be
forwarded to the
Criminal Law Team (CLT) or in Scotland and Northern
Ireland the appropriate Prosecutor.
1.1.4 Assist the CLT or Prosecutor to decide whether a criminal
prosecution should proceed and, if
so, what charges and mode of trial are appropriate.

1.1.5 Enable the CLT or Prosecutor to comply with “Advance
disclosure”.
1.1.6 Assist the prosecution, the defence and the court in the
conduct of the case. (This is only where the written record of

interview has been accepted by the defence).

1.2 A written record will be required in respect of every interview that
Investigators conduct with

suspects except:

1.2.1Where the case is deemed suitable for a Simple Caution.
2. Where there is to be no prosecution. (Cases where no further
action is to be taken
or the interviewee is returned to duty to be dealt with
under the conduct code).

1.3 Investigators must seek agreement of the CWM in their business unit
before the decision not to
produce a written record of interview is taken. Once it is agreed,
the pertinent facts of the interview should be included in the
Suspect Offender Report in accordance with P & S Docs 8.2 and 8.3
Guide to the Preparation of Suspect Offender Reports.

1.4 There are two types of written record of taped interview and these

are;

1.4.1 Taped Interview Summary - to be used when paragraph 2.1
applies.

1.4.2A Full Taped Interview Transcript - to be used when paragraph
3.1 applies.

1.5 The lead interviewing Investigator is responsible for ensuring that

the written record of interview is
accurate.

1.6 All written records of interview should be recorded on form GS015
“Record of Tape Recorded Interviews” and the continuation form
GSO15A. The preamble of the form should be completed in full in all
written records.

2. Taped Interview Summary

POL00104875
POL00104875

2.1 A Taped Interview Summary should be produced in all cases where it is
appropriate to
complete a written record of interview and a full taped interview
transcript is not required. (See paragraph 1.4 above and section 3
below) .

2.2 Each Master Tape and each Taped Interview Summary must be produced as
individual exhibits in the lead interviewing Investigator’s witness
statement. The second interviewing Investigator will merely state
that they were present at the interview and will make reference to
the tape exhibits(s) in their witness statement.

2.3 The Taped Interview Summary will include aspects which should be
recorded verbatim and other aspects which may be summarised. The
following should be recorded verbatim.

2.3.1 Admissions. All admissions, whether partial, ambiguous or
qualified, and the questions leading up to them. (Ambiguous or
qualified admissions may well include defences to the
offence(s) and these should also be recorded verbatim).

2.3.2 Reference to bail and alternative pleas or charges. These
should not be discussed during the interview. However, if this
is raised by the suspect their questions and the replies should
be recorded verbatim.

2.3.3Details of Special Warnings (if given by a Constable), or the
failure or refusal by the suspect;

a. To account for any object, substance or mark which was found
at the time of his

apprehension, either on his person; or in or on his
clothing or footwear; or otherwise in

his possession; or in the place where he was apprehended.
b. To account for his presence on apprehension at the same

place, and at or about the same

time, which the alleged offence occurred.

ec. To answer questions whether adequately or not at all, which
deal with a material part of
the allegation.

2.4 Wherever verbatim direct speech is referred to in the Taped
Interview Summary the tape counter time should be recorded at the
start of the direct speech in the relevant column. The identity of
the speaker should also be recorded in the second column by using
their initials.

2.5 The following points may be summarised.
2.5.1 Denials. Details of offences that the suspect is denying.
2.5.2 Description of exhibits. Details of items of

evidence shown to the suspect during the
interview, including the item reference number.

2.5.3 Aggravating Factors. For example, the defendant was stealing
from a charity, or very personal items. It would also include
such things as previous warnings about relevant previous
behaviour. If the suspect was shown a P13 this should also be
included.

2.5.4Mitigating Circumstances. Any circumstances which might tell
in favour of the suspect must be included. Examples of which
could be illness, sincere regret, attempt to repay etc. Care
must be taken however to distinguish between mitigation and
lines of defence. If a line of defence is offered then these
should be recorded verbatim as in paragraph 2.3.1 above.

2.5.5 Any other relevant point which has not already been included.
These are other matters not detailed above which are

considered important and relevant and should be included to
effectively describe the circumstances of the case.
2.5.6Events in the Interview. Such as periods of significant
silence, changing the tapes or breaks
in the interview.

2.6 When Investigators summarise parts of the interview they should do so
in reported speech in the

third person. Additionally, they should record the start time
on the tape counter of the information

summarised.

3. Full Taped Interview Transcript

3.1 Full Taped Interview transcripts are to be produced in the
circumstances detailed below;
3.1.1 In all cases being referred to the CLT for advice where

the suspect offender has declined to
answer any, or the majority of questions put to them.
3.1.2 The CLT (or the prosecutor) requests a full transcript due to
the complex nature of the
investigation.
3.1.3An Investigator requests transcripts due to significant
operational commitments or the
complex nature of the enquiries.

3.2 Post Office Ltd has its own arrangements for producing Full Taped
Interview Transcripts, details of which can be obtained from their
CWM. Royal Mail Security and PFWW Investigators should follow the
process detailed in 3.3 to 3.8 below.

3.3 No Comment Interviews. Copies of the “working” tape(s) to be
transcribed should be forwarded to the Prosecution Support Office
(PSO) along with a completed form GS108. (The original “working”
tape(s) should be retained with the file).

3.4 Requests by the CLT or Prosecutor. Following a request the PSO will
obtain from the Investigator a copy of the working tape(s) and a
completed form GS108.

3.5 Requests from an Investigator. The Investigator must in the first
instance make a request to CWM. If it is agreed that a transcript
should be prepared the Investigator must complete form GS108 and send
it with copies of the working tape(s) to the PSO.

3.6 The PSO will then send the tapes to the external supplier; The
Essential Secretary. The completed tape transcript will be returned
by email to the PSO who will forward it to the Investigator by the
next working day. Once checked and amended as necessary the
Investigator is required to return a copy of it to the PSO, who will
send it by email to the CLT. Where the PSO is in possession of the
case file, a copy of the transcript will be paginated in and a
further copy placed in Appendix B. Investigators will do the same if
they hold the file.

3.7 Important Note. Case files should not be delayed merely to await the
Full Tape Transcript. They should be forwarded as normal but
commenting in the report that the transcripts will be associated as
soon as practicable.
