Dave,

Yes, Dave Johns is a possibility.

I’m now feeling much better and expect to back to work as normal on Monday. The issue then becomes one of
prioritisation between these cases and my work on supporting HNG-X migration. That is clearly down to you and Alan
D’Alvarez to decide and not me!

Regards

Is this something that Dave Johns could cover or are his skills in a different area?

Thanks Gareth, I believe Dave Keeling was going for an extension due to our Technical Expert being sick.

Hope you are feeling a bit better this AM.

Graham,

I doubt if Allan would be comfortable with that. It isn’t really his area of expertise. One possibility is Chris
Bailey, but he’s not been that involved in the accounting side. Another possibility is Anne Chambers from
SSC, but I know she is very reluctant to get involved and in the past I’ve tended to front things up for her.

Dave,
Unfortunately Gareth went home sick yesterday and is still off. Not sure when he is likely to be back
so we might need to find an alternative person for the witness statement.

Graham,
Is there anyone that could prepare such a statement — I was thinking Allan Hodgkinson as a
candidate?

Alan

Post Office has a forthcoming prosecution against a sub-postmaster at West Byfleet. Gareth Jenkins
is again being asked to act as expert witness and provide a report on a large amount of information.
Due to Gareths workload in support of the programme, he is struggling to complete the report. The
FUJ00154877
FUJ00154877

Post Office Barrister can request an extension for Gareth to complete this which in itself needs Gareth
to have gone through the information, or Post Office can prioritise the programme or the legal case.

Can you gain a view of their prioritisation?

Regards
Dave
