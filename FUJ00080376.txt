FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN

1 Introduction

1.1. Owner

The owner of the Major Incident Management process at the local POA level is the Fujitsu POA Senior
SDM, Problem and Major Incident.

Objective

The key objective of the procedure is to ensure effective and efficient management of Major Incidents,
through:

e Improvement of communication channels

« Clarification of the need to communicate awareness of potential incidents

e Improved accuracy of reporting of incident status

e Allowing technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident
e Avoiding unnecessary alerting of the service integrator and/or the customer

e Demonstrating a professional approach to Atos, the Service Integrator contracted to POL, and
Post Office Limited (the customer) and their clients.

« Provision of clearly defined roles and responsibilities

e Defined reporting and updating timelines throughout a major incident.
e Improved governance

e Assessing which incidents are major and which are ‘Business as Usual’

Note: This procedure is based upon the historical processes agreed between Post Office Limited and the
Post Office Account over a period of around fifteen years.

1.2 Rationale

This document outlines the communication and management procedure and guidelines to be used for
Major Incidents impacting the live estate.

The methodology defined within this document augments the existing SMS framework procedure
presently deployed within the live estate.

The aim of the document is to provide a pre-defined procedure for future major incident communication
and management.

Mandatory Guidelines

It is important to maintain a balance between:

a) Allowing the technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident

b) Avoiding unnecessary alerting of the customer
c) Assessing which incidents are major
The following guidelines should be adhered to.

During the MAC Core Hours (Monday — Friday 08:00 — 20:00, Saturday 08:00 — 17:00) and Bank
Holidays 0800 — 1400 excluding Christmas Day. The MAC should be the first point of operational
contact between Fujitsu and the Atos Service Desk. Outside these hours the Atos Service Desk
or Atos OOH Duty Manager should contact the SMC. The SMC are responsible for escalation of
incidents to the POA OOH Duty Manager. The POA OOH Duty Manager may initiate
communications with the Atos OOH Duty Manger. The SMC operate on a 24 x 7 x 365 basis.

Any activity detailed in this document which is assigned to the MAC team is handed over to the
SMC outside the MAC Core Hours, with the exception of the above.

The relevant technical teams who are aware of and monitoring a potential major incident must
page / call the appropriate Major Incident Manager (Duty Manager out of hours) as soon as
possible. This is not limited to major incidents alone, but applies wherever a state other than
Business as Usual has been detected. The Major Incident Manager must in turn communicate
the potential incident, to the Atos Service Desk for awareness and monitoring in Atos. This is
usually done via the MAC team in core hours or via SMC out of hours.

The Major Incident Manager (or Duty Manager out of hours) is responsible for communicating
both up the Fujitsu organisation and across (see appendix 9.3) to their counterpart in Atos.
Where this is impractical (e.g. leave, out of hours, unavailable), the initiative should be taken to
jump up the organisation. Of prime importance is that the customer is informed in a timely
manner and at the correct touch point. This communication should be by voice or direct SMS.
The communication should include the date, time, name, nature of problem, severity, if service
affecting, likely impact, and the Fujitsu owner to contact.

The Major Incident Manager (Duty Manager OOH, who covers Monday to Friday 17:30 to 09:00
and from 17:00 Friday though to 09:00 Monday) should also initiate communication using SMS
via the MAC team (see operational hours above.). Outside of these hours the SMS should be via
the SMC. The SMS distribution list used is titled ‘SMS Internal’ and amongst others includes the
appropriate members of the POA Operations Management Team.

POA Operations Major Incident Procedure

Fe)
FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

3 Definition of a Major Incident

3.1 Incident Classification

As a general rule a Major Incident will be an incident rated as a Business Critical Incident as shown in
the following

- The ‘CONTRACT’
- Sections 3.2 and 3.3 below.
- POA Operations Incident Management Procedure document (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018).

- A series of connected lower severity incidents which combine to have a significant business
impact.

However not all incidents rated as Severity 1 qualify as a Major Incident as the severity levels do not
always reflect the overall business impact to POL. For example a single counter post office which is
unable to trade, regardless of its business volumes, is rated as a Severity 1 incident.

For incident classification on Post Office Account refer to the POA Incident Enquiry Matrix
SVM/SDM/SD/0023.

3.2. Influencing Factors in calling a Major Incident

It is important that a Major Incident is defined in accordance with section 3.3 Major Incident Triggers, as
such, because of its business impact on the day when it occurs, rather than simply being defined as a
Major Incident because it appears on a list. However the following parameters will also feed into the
consideration of whether a major incident should be called:

e Duration, i.e. how long has the vulnerability to service already existed?

e Impact across the estate, including consideration of whether a service is merely degraded or
actually stopped

e Time at which the event occurs in relation to the 24 hour business day
e Time of year — e.g. Christmas / Easter / End of month / quarter

e Anticipated time before service can be resumed

« Impact to POL branches, customers, clients or brand image

e Business initiatives e.g. product launches

3.3 Major Incident Triggers

The following criteria could trigger a major incident, however as detailed in 3.2, the influencing factors
must also be considered. As such the list below is not exhaustive, whilst if an incident occurs which is
not detailed below, e.g., legislative, it should not necessarily be precluded from being declared a major
incident.

It should be noted that any call trends in relation to the following, should be reported to the POA Duty
Manager as soon as the agreed threshold levels have been breached.

3.3.1. Network Triggers
Network Major Incident triggers are as follows:

« Complete or significant outage of the Central network, e.g. failure of both 3750 stack Catalyst
switches in totality for the Core layer in IRE11.

e Total loss of environments providing individual online service capability
« Breach of access to data centres
e Breach of security
« Virus outbreak

3.3.3. Data Centre Triggers
Data Centre Major Incident triggers are as follows:
e Network / LAN outage
e Loss of Data Centre, or significant loss of Data Centre Components

e Breach of security

3.3.4 Online Service Triggers

e Online service unavailable within the Data Centre (not counter level)

e Number of Branches without Communications Services — as defined by POL and in accordance
with Ping script thresholds.

e Third party provided service failure - e.g. DVLA, Link, Moneygram, Santander etc

N.B Once the third party service provider has been deemed to be the source of the Major
Incident; it will be managed by either POA or Atos Service Desk in accordance with whichever
organisation manages that supplier relationship.

3.3.5 I POLSAP Service Triggers
POLSAP services Major Incident Triggers are as follows:

e Business stopped for any Fujitsu controlled reason, Post Office unable to process any POLSAP
business transactions.

e APOLSAP central system failure resulting in Post Office departments being unable to process
work, e.g., FSC (POL settling with clients and tracking stock and cash for Post Office Ltd),
Supply Chain (Cash Services Business Unit) or Cash Services CMS System (Quotations and
Client Management)

« Complete loss of a Fujitsu supported POLSAP application.

« Outage of key infrastructure which affects any of the above POLSAP services.

e APOLSAP security incident

e Actual or suspected attacks on the Fujitsu Services Buildings and its resources, POA Network
or Information Systems

«Theft of IT equipment / property, and in particular PIN Pads
° Theft of software

e Either Cardholder Data or Sensitive Authentication Data not being handled as described in the
CCD entitled “Security Constraints” (ARC/SEC/ARC/0001).

In the event of a Security Incident, minor or major (which may also include PCI Incidents), the POA
Operational Security Manager MUST be informed.

4 Calling the Major Incident

During business hours the Major Incident Manager declares and manages the Major Incident (with
handovers to the POA OOH Duty Manager where applicable.)

Where the impact of the incident is not immediately obvious, and it is not clear if a Major Incident should
be called, escalation and discussion with the POA Operations Management Team should occur, and a
collective decision made. If a Major Incident is not called, the incident should be monitored until closure,
to ensure that the impact does not increase to that of a Major Incident.

In the event that multiple services are impacted, multiple Major Incident Managers may be appointed by
any Service Lead or Senior SDM and will remain in their roles until incident closure.

Out of hours the POA OOH Duty Manager is responsible for declaring a Major Incident.

Section 8 of this document specifies the roles and responsibilities during a major incident. The Major
Incident Manager, see section 8.2, is referred to the Manage Major Incident Procedure and must
endeavour throughout the life of a major incident to adhere to the principles of that procedure.

o prevent recurrence of the incident
o minimise future business impact
o improve the procedure for the management of incidents

Output: To confirm details provided in the draft MIR provided to Atos, update with corrective actions and
redistribute. To also include any of the following as appropriate

- any activities for a Service Improvement Plan

- any Changes and associated MSC numbers

- any follow up that requires to be progressed via Problem Management
- any improvements to KELS, alerting and /or event management

The agreed impact of the Major Incident must be provided for inclusion in the Counter Availability SLT
Figures.

If this review highlights areas where improvements can be made, an agreed Service Improvement Plan
will be produced with appropriate actions, owners and timescales. It will also identify any ongoing risks to
the service, together with any changes. Service Management will track all actions to resolution. Third
party actions will be reviewed at Service Review meetings.

It is important that the number of branches impacted and the duration of the Major Incident is agreed at
the Major Incident Review. This information is required to calculate the impact on Branch and Counter
Availability and any associated Liquidated Damages (LD) liabilities

7.3 Calculating potential LD liability for Major Incidents

Major Incidents which qualify as Failure Events are detailed in the Branch Network Service Description
(SVM/SDM/SD0011). A Failure Event is defined in this document as an event or series of connected
events which causes one or more Counter Positions to be deemed to be Unavailable due to a Network
Wide Failure or a Local Failure. Ongoing failures will be deemed to be part of such a Failure Event until
the Failure Event is closed in accordance with the Incident closure and Major Incident Review process as
detailed in section 6.0.

For a Failure Event the Incident Closure & Major Incident Review Process will require Atos and Fujitsu to
agree the number of branches and counter positions affected and the duration of the outage (rounded to
the nearest 30 minutes as detailed in the Network Wide Rounding Table).

Network Wide Rounding Table

8 Fujitsu Roles and Responsibilities during a Major
Incident

This section defines the roles and responsibilities individuals and teams have as part of the Major
Incident Escalation Procedure. The following roles will be laminated and available for the MIM to assign
during a Major Incident.

8.1 Role of the MAC Team

The role of the Major Account Controllers team in the event of a Major Incident is as follows:

e Receive phone calls and log incidents from Atos Service Desk, and communicate the progress
of investigations to the Atos Service Desk.

Notes:

1, There is also a HDI interface between Atos SDM12 and Fujitsu TfS systems so incidents and
updates may be automatically transferred as well

2, These incidents are generally considered ‘software’ incidents as branch engineering incidents
are no longer managed by Fujitsu.

e Escalation of any Call Threshold Breaches to the POA Duty Manager
e Confirming times and details to Major Incident Manager (MIM)

« Send/update service impact details from the Atos Service Desk (e.g., trend analysis, which the
MAC is dependant upon Atos supplying) to the Major Incident Manager. These details will be
fed into the Technical Bridge in real time as requested, whilst details for the overall Major
Incident will be provided to the Major Incident Manager post the incident.

e Be responsible for sending communications as provided by the Major Incident Communications
Manager for the following:-

To send out SMS text messages and attend all Technical Bridges
- SMS to SMS Technical Bridge
To inform of new Major Incidents and provide MI updates of progress to the following
- E Mail Atos Service Desk
- Voice Atos Service Desk
- SMS to SMS Internal — POA Internal
- SMS to SMS TOWER - Senior Management

NB

The above communications will be as per instructed by the Major Incident
Communications Manager

ALL should be identical, in order to avoid any misunderstandings.

This also of course includes notification to Atos Service Desk and POA Management of
the restoration of service.

8.2 Role of the Major Incident Manager

Major Incident Manager (MIM). This will by default be either the Day Time Duty Manager or OOH Duty
Manager (hours shown in 9.3). However a separate member of the Service Management team may be
appointed as the MIM depending on the situation. The primary role of the MIM in a Major Incident is to
facilitate the management of the Incident through investigation and diagnosis to resolution, with the aim
of making the process as efficient and effective as possible. Upon determining that a Major Incident has
been called, a request for a Technical Recovery Manager (TRM) will be made to the appropriate POA
Service Lead or Senior SDM who will appoint one of his team to be the TRM. The Major Incident
Manager acts as the central point for communication and non-technical information flow, allowing the
TRM to focus on the technical situation and the resolution of the Incident. The Major Incident Manager is
also responsible for creating and maintaining all the associated documentation. For the process to be
effective, all updates and information regarding the incident must be fed to the MIM to update the
timelines and report.

The Major Incident Manager:
e Calls and chairs the Technical Bridge

e Has responsibility for creating the Major Incident Report, using the template defined in
section9.1 and ensuring that the applicable information is captured.

e Records the Technical Bridge attendees names so they can be documented in the Major Incident
Report.

e Identifies Business and Service impact though discussions with the users, the Atos Service Desk
and the MAC team — providing this input into the Tech Bridge.

e Distributes the Technical Bridge actions provided by the TRM (if appropriate).

e In conjunction with the TRM considers if escalation into the Corporate Alert process is desirable
and recommends this when required, see section 6.8 above.

e Assists with communication internally within the POA
e Track time lines

e Along with the POA Problem Manager, ensures that the TRM provides regular updates on any
longer term corrective actions.

« Following the resolution of the Incident, schedules and chairs the PIR
