Dear Sirs

Thank you for your instructions to act in the above matter. I confirm I have received the papers and if there are
any matters I need further instructions on then I will be in touch.

I have confirmed that I understand that I can charge for my services on the same basis as I do for the Royal
Mail? Could you please confirm this?

At the end of the case I tend to keep the file papers as part of my records but will return them if you require me

to do so.

I will send a written report and trust that I can do this by email unless you prefer otherwise.

Best regards

Robert Booker
