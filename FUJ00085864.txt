Subject: Outreach rems - further instances

remin_2.txt

Not sure who needs to know this, but just in case anyone is interested...
| have found 4 more instances of the problem by scanning all the available BLE files (back to 14** May 2015). The analysis shows that
the scan | did might not be sufficient to pick up all instances (if they remmed in currency but not cash at the same time). It could be

redone if we need to be more confident that we have picked up all problems of this type.

2 of the branches received TCs to correct the ‘miskeyed rems’ (presumably after contacting NBSC, or as a result of FSC noting an
anomaly?). The other 2 remmed out a corresponding amount, to remove the discrepancy.

lf the branches raised calls, they didn’t make it as far as TFS.

Details attached (Gareth already has a copy of this).

| have changed the wording as it is not as clear-cut as you would like.

The issue affects only manual remittances and so is most likely to be encountered at outreach branches when completing a
branch-to-branch remittance in. Out of the estate of around 11075 branches, there are currently around 950 branches
where branch-to-branch rems are enabled; 473 of these are outreach branches.

Examining the system, we have seen 5 occurrences in the last 3 months, all at outreach branches. We are not able to look
back further.

A receipt is printed for each rem in, and a transaction log search will show multiple rems for the same amount, each with
different session numbers, so the branch is able to see that this problem has occurred.

As | suspect the next thing | will be asked for is the affected branches, here they are:

BRANCH Date AMOUNT (#) First session

Number of rems

106444 09-SEP-15 150

820888

When we were talking about this last, you had some numbers which put the issue into perspective. Can you dig them out again on
Monday please, I’m looking for something like: This issue is only seen at outreach branches, of which there are xxxxx (out of an
estate of 11075 branches). Examining the system, we have seen x occurrences in the last 6 months.

Tony,

As Steve pointed out, | raised KEL acha621P. | will amend it to include the avoidance action but | don’t think it is realistic to expect
FUJ00085864
FUJ00085864

postmasters to avoid the problem by not pressing Enter multiple times; they are presented with a screen which tells them to press
Enter to exit and so they do.

To get out of the loop they have to press Cancel which gives them an error message saying they have not printed all their receipts
(not true).

| also tried to be careful about any recommendations as to what they should do about the discrepancy, we cannot advise on this as
we don’t know whether there would be any knock-on effects (for example on POLSAP). All | did was point out what had happened
elsewhere. NBSC (probably with POL FSC) need to advise on this. If it is found that remming out again does cause additional
problems, other alternatives may need to be considered.

(’m surprised this has not been reported to us before. Although it’s not in an area that has been changed in recent years, it may be
that the info left lying around after the incomplete logon is now different and is more likely to result in the wrong screen being
displayed.

Please see the e-mail chain below. From Peak and the e-mail chain | can see you did much of the investigation on this incident and
as you can see in the following e-mail it was concluded that Post Master could be advised how to avoid this happening and what to
do if they did get into a transaction discrepancy situation.

Could you please produce a KEL covering this incident advising of the avoidance actions.

Thank you

Hi Sandie,

Looking at Peak PC0246949 it appears to be derived from 17991774 and | found TfS incident A105041260. There is no Problem
Record raised for this, however Peak PC0246997 was used by Development to investigate this. A code fix has been developed, but
requires official testing and releasing. I've made enquires and unfortunately LST are unable to take the fix for testing in Release
12.88 without significantly impacting that release to live.

As the condition can be avoided by Post Masters, i.e., by making them aware of the condition and advising them not to press enter
multiple times, | propose that this is KEL’ed and included in the counter Release 13.05.

Regards
Tony

Hi POA DM
Have PEAK make you aware of this issue?
Do you have a PR open — please see below from Atos in RED.

Below is what I sent to Atos earlier —
Hi Katie

Im coming in blind on this — Looking at the incident this is our update from PEAK

TfS Connector 15/10/2015 15:57 00:00:00 Provider Desk Resolution POA-Horizon

Provider Ref; PC0246949

Resolution Details: Update by Anne Chambers:Category 70 -- Final -- Avoidance Action Supplied: We have found that if there is a logout before a
user has fully logged on, then subsequently a pouch is remmed in manually (most likely at an outreach branch), then after the rem in slip has
been printed, the same screen is redisplayed and the user is likely to press Enter again and duplicate the remittance, possibly several times. A
different screen should be displayed which would prevent this happening.

Arrem in slip is printed each time, showing the same details but different session numbers, and a transaction log search confirms the repeated
rems.

This is not an area that has changed for several years so it likely to have happened before but we have no record of it having been reported to
us. I can only check back two months; I've found 4 other instances (outreach branches 214869, 106444, 110444, 207828) and all but the last
FUJ00085864
FUJ00085864

removed the discrepancy by completing a rem out for the excess, which corrected the system cash holding. Branch 224843 may be able to do the
same but NBSC should advise on this.

We are continuing to investigate the problem (PC0246997), but any fix will not retrospectively change the branch accounts.

So we are aware of the issue and are continuing to investigate but NBSC should be able to sort the discrepancy out in the
meantime.

By the sounds of it NBSC are just saying it our issue — which we are investigating — BUT they are missing the fact that they can sort
the discrepancy out.

Is this issue an open problem (if so is there a PR reference?)

When was this issue first observed?

Do we have any indications as to the potential root cause?
What is the current action plan and associated timescales for resolution?

Thankyou Katie,

If this incident is caused by the branch action it may be right and proper for NBSC to offer the advice
given below however I am concerned that there have been 4 incidents identified by Fujitsu with no
explanation sitting behind them.

NBSC cannot check what the branch has done on their Horizon system and do not understand the impact
to the Branch Account hence the request for support from our colleagues in Finance Service Centre.

Where incidents like this occur I would expect an explanation of the root cause to be supplied by Fujitsu
via Atos so that both our Finance Service Centre and NBSC colleagues can be assured that the right
advice is given, there is no impact to the branch account and a full audit trail is available. It does not feel
right for Atos and Fujitsu to be giving instruction to NBSC to speak to branches with advice with
insufficient information.

If this has happened in this case it would be useful to see that in this email trail.

Hi Rod/Dawn

Could | enlist your help and support on the below issue please?

Whilst | am happy for NBSC to try and support where they can, the concern | have with the below is we have no process for
managing this type of issue and we are unable to see any of the back end accounting for this Branch. Therefore, any advice that we
try and provide could end up making matters worse — this is already showing a £24k loss. | am not happy for NBSC to give advice

on something that is not a process that exists within the knowledgebase.

Similar to a disconnected session, NBSC would have no understanding as to the implications on branch accounting if they were to
advise the branch as suggested below.

From the explanation below, this appears to be a technical issue, however, | don’t know if you have any other previous similar
scenarios that would advise on what the correct process should be for this particular situation?

Many thanks

Hi Kendra,

| can provide some background here which will hopefully explain why | suggested this call. The below issue was raised with lan
Thomas by Helen Baker on 8" October:

This morning Anne Remmed £8000 from core branch to outreach using barcode.

When she accepted into outreach, and settled, horizon printed receipt, then another, then another, then another..she managed to
stop it at four receipts of £8000 from the one barcode rem in transaction.

She was concerned as she had never seen this before. She balanced core and it was correct, but outreach was £24,000 short.
Although the core had sent only one lot of £8000, the outreach had accepted 4 lots of £8000 in one transaction!

She has spoken to NBSC ref 1358666 who told her it was a technical issue.

She then phoned the IT help desk ref: 17972295. She was unconvinced they understood the problem although they said they would
probably ‘rectify remotely’. After waiting till the end of day, she called back and escalated to option 7 and spoke to Rich who told
her to phone NBSC.

| don't think the helpline understood what's happened. | can understand that as you would think it not possible. But, incredibly,
Anne's outreach horizon now shows £24,000 short and it doesn't exist. As you can imagine, Anne is concerned and | have told her
not to touch the outreach unit until this is resolved for her.

The incident was passed to Fujitsu who have advised that in order to resolve the issue, the branch/NBSC must ‘complete a rem out
for the excess to correct the cash holding’ which Fujitsu are unable to do. The NBSC has subsequently advised that they cannot
assist as this is an IT issue however Fujitsu are also advising that they cannot assist. As a result, the issue has been passed back and
forward for over a week.

In order to resolve this as quickly as possible for the branch and avoid any further delays, | suggested a call between all parties to
discuss and agree a way forward.

| hope this helps.
Thanks,
Katie

As this incident is not getting resolved can we have con-call set up between NBSC & Fujitsu.

The Site had transaction discrepancy,

As per Fujitsu, they have found found 4 other instances (outreach branches 214869, 106444, 110444, 207828) and all but the last
removed the discrepancy by completing a rem out for the excess, which corrected the system cash holding. Branch 224843 may be
