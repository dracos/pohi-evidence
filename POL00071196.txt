SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF HELEN ROSE
I, HELEN ROSE (nee Hollingworth) off GRO

WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS:

1. Lam currently a Security Analyst for the Post Office Limited (the Post Office) and
have been a Security Analyst since 25 September 2006. Prior to being a Security
Analyst, I was an Investigations Manager from September 2004 to 24 September
2006. Prior to that, I was an auditor at the Post Office for 5 years since August
1999. I have worked for the Post Office for over 9 years since approximately
February 1997

2. [ make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless
otherwise stated. I have had the benefit of reading through the audit papers.
References to page numbers in this Witness Statement are to page numbers of
Exhibit HR2 to this Witness Statement.

3. As an Auditor, | was responsible for auditing Post Office branches. I usuaily carried
out at least 1 audit every day, although sometimes it could be closer to 2 or 3

audits and on 1 occasion | remember that I did 4 audits. I wouid therefore

conservatively estimate that over the 5 years whilst I was an auditor, I carried out

well over 1,400 audits.

On 23 March 2004, I attended the branch of the Post Office at 14 South Marine
Drive, Bridlington, YO1S 3DB (the Marine Drive branch), together with my
colleague Chris Taylor, We arrived at approximately 8.00 a.m. I had not had any
previous involvement with the Marine Drive branch.

The process of carrying out the audit involves physically counting the cash and
stock at the Marine Drive branch, checking the paperwork such as Giro deposits
and withdrawal receipts, Pensions and Allowances Reports and where appropriate,

declared cash receipts.

Mr Castleton explained that he had been having problems balancing the books and
that those problems had started in the cash account week ending 43 (21 January
2004) with a shortfall of £4,230.97. Mr Castleton was adamant that the
misbalances were due to a computer problem and that no members of his staff
could be committing theft. In my considerable experience as an auditor, I have
never personally come across any computer problem generating cash shortfalls
and Mr Castleton’s explanation sounded compietely implausible to me.

The handwritten notes of the audit are at pages 1'to 47 and a typed copy of the
audit is at pages 48 to 64. A copy of the conclusion of my report is at page’65. Ih
short, having performed a full audit of the cash and stock, I found that at 23
March 2004 the branch was short of £25,758.75 cash. This was a result of
unauthorised losses that had accumulated in the cash account of which a portion
had been transferred to the suspense account for many weeks leading up to the
audit, (For clarification I should confirm that the report is erroneously dated 25
rather than 23 March 2004. I believe that the audit took place on 23 March 2004
and that this is a typographical error. The report also lists weeks 48 to 43 and
their figures twice and this is also simply a typographical error).

As part of a normal audit, we have to complete a procedural security inspection.
This was initiated by my colleague Chris Taylor. When a postmaster is suspended
then any remaining compliance tests are not completed, because of the large
number of compliance tests (including security compliance) that have to be
compieted for each audit. Accordingly, although the procedurat security inspection
was started as a matter of routine, 1 do not recall it being completed because Mr

Castleton was suspended prior to its completion and it then became irreievant.

A typed copy of the control gaps that were identified after the security inspection
was initiated is at page’63. The inspection revealed that the safe was left open,
the safe keys were left in the safe door and it was not secured, that cash and stock

were not secured during lunchtime if the Sub-Postmaster was not on the premises,

that Travellers Cheques were not kept in the safe and Foreign Currency was not
held securely, that standard procedures for adjusting losses and gains were not
adhered to (because losses were unauthorised) and personal cheques on hand had
been incorrectly treated. However, I should add that I believe the reason Mr
Castleton was subsequently suspended was because the Marine Drive branch was
short of a significant amount of cash, rather than because of the control gaps that

the security inspection identified.

10. I do remember that Mr Castleton left the branch at lunchtime and returned in the

afternoon smelting strongly of alcohol.

11. I did not remove any documents from the Marine Drive branch during the audit. If
there were any documents that are required, I always ask the Sub-Postmaster to
print off his spare copy. I understand that one of the live issues in this case is
whether any balance snapshots were removed. A balance snapshot is a report that
contains what the computer records is the total cash in stock figure and all
transactions, sales, stock and method of payments at a branch. Every time a
transaction takes place the snapshot would alter because it looks at the previous
weeks’ declared cash in stock and adjusts items as they are sold, so if someone
forgets to enter an item that a customer has purchased, then the balance snapshot
figures will be inaccurate. It is only a balancing aid for postmasters and not
classed as an accounting document, On arriving at a branch, an auditor might ask
the postmaster to print out a balance snapshot, sometimes 2, (1 for file without
any marks on and a working copy for ticking off things, when checked). There
would be no reason or benefit to even look at previous balance snapshots. 1
certainly do not recall removing any daily balance snapshots and for the reason I
have explained, they would not have been particularly useful to me.

12. E was not involved with the case any further after completing the audit.

I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.
