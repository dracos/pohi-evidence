Thanks Rod.

We need to go quicker in the KELS analysis. It can not take several weeks - board will not accept that and that
was not the original timetable so again resource management- can HSF assist to get this done urgently. The
exam question is what would it take to get all of it done by next week. Also there is no explanation for saying it
would be completed by the end of this week when only 690/14000 has been done. Please escalate to the highest
levels at WBD and HSF.

Also we need the answer to the scope question. The report just leaves it that there is a risk and we will continue
to work in the scope. We have reported that we are working on the scope now for two weeks. We have to say
what is the scope that would diminish the risk. Again, it doesn’t address what I have asked for. Can you please
take it back to WBD but also HSF. I’m not sensing the urgency that the GE and Board has on this issue coming
through.

I would expect a fairly strong negative reaction in its current form. Do you not agree ?

Can WBD and HSF urgently address my concerns and send it to me by tomorrow morning and then it must go
to Board. It’s already now over due.

Kind regards
Ben

HI Ken / Rod

Thanks for this update but i think it needs some work — ie incorporating Andy’s email re the audit. Also, the section 2
and 3 don’t really align. Can we get a clearer statement on how many previous KELS did we find, how many have been
analysised now, how many to go, how many bad ones (ie category 4 and 5) and how they would impact the outcome of
a trial {ie WBD need to be able to say whether given the content of the KELS its likely the court will reconvene and that
the experts should have an opportunity to consider — if they cant/wont then just go to HSF to ensure our instructions are
being followed.

Can someone do an executive summary of counsel’s advice. We need to do an audit — this goes beyond GLO but POL
actually having operational oversight over it most material outsourced arrangement so we need to understand the
solution to this {is it the scope or a timing issue) but politically that advice will not land well with the Board so we need
to manage it.

Rod — as Ken is now on leave, I think you will need to do the above or have someone of the externals or secondees
support. I need to update the Board tomorrow.

We also need to work on the Group Litigation Board paper — you need to send it across to HSF to amend in light of the
meeting that occurred at HSF today and to ensure that reflects the actions in that meeting. I suggest you speak to Kate
Emmauel. it would be helpful if the paper set out (a) mediation process explaining tactical decisions {ie there is a
difference to asking them to authorise settlement up to £45m does not mean that we go in and offer that amount in our
first offer) (b) in a simple timeline, the milestones. By way of illustration:

- Board subcommittee x

- Board meeting 29/10

- Horizon judgment 1/11- onwards

- Permission to Appeal CU Hearing 12/11

- Board Subcommittee approving settlement authority range x

-  BEIS authority?

- Mediation 25/26?

POL-0039628
POL00043146
POL00043146

Make sure that we only seeking the board’s permission to note the approach and to delegate/authorise the board
subcommittee to authorise the GC to make a settlement on the terms determined by the Board Subcommittee.

Iwill need to see that finalised paper on Monday morning ( as papers are due COB Monday)

Kind regards

Hi Ben
Please see attached draft update for this week for the Board on the KELs issue. I understand that our CEO had a call with

the Fujitsu Europe SVP, but I don’t know what the outcome of that call was so I have suggested in the update for item 1
that the CEO will update the Board directly.

Table attached both as a Sharepoint link and separate word doc for convenience.

lam on leave tomorrow, but please do call me if you have any queries on this (07764943488). I understand Rod will be
WFH tomorrow if you need him.

Thanks
Ken
