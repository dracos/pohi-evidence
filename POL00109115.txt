Hi David,

Have you any thoughts on a holding reply? Also, was James’s comment about having the working group meetings less
“awerly” mentioned to Paula? Any thoughts on how we should respond to this?

Thanks,
Avene

Yes am dealing with it. Am researching the case at the moment, initial thinking here is that it is not a case that Paula
should meet James on this case so please don’t agree any meeting with his office — also please don’t let them know that
is the thinking until we have finished researching the case. { will draft a holding reply though ~ just need to check who
that should be sent by.

Regards

David

Hi David,

Hope you had a good weekend, Just a quick one, are you dealing with the Jim Hood MP request? If so, can you advise
what the latest is and when we are likely to confirm back to James Arbuthnot?

Many thanks,
Avene
