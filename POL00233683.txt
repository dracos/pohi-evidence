POL00233683
A STARTING POINT FOR THE TERMS OF REFERENCE

1. To establish whether the cash shortfalls identified in the complaints

made by sub-postmasters were caused by accounting system errors.
2. To establish whether, if such accounting system errors did exist,

thewy have now been resolved.
3. To established that no such accounting system errors are now present

in the computerised accounting system.
4, To establish the steps taken to investigate complaints by sub-

postmasters about the computerised accounting system (arising
following cash shortfalls). What steps have been taken and with what
outcome. What steps (if any) realistically now remain to be taken to
investigate the complaints.

[Note - 3 above can include (but is not limited to) the mediation scheme]

5. Should the Post Office now take any further action in respect of
complaints made by sub-postmasters that errors in the computerised
accounts system have caused cash shortfalls.

6. To establish whether what assistance and advice was provided by the
Help Desk [is this the correct description?] when contacted in respect
of cash shortfalls. To establish whether the assistance and advice
provided was appropriate.

7. To establish whether, in the instances where cash shortfalls resulted in
a decision to prosecute charges of theft, there was (at the time the
charge was made) an appropriate evidential basis for the theft charge.

Note

The above is simply a starting point for discussion on what the terms of
reference to be set now, should be.
I have tried to capture all course of action for the Post Office that could arise
from the complaints. It may well be the position that a significant part of the
work suggested above has already been undertaken. If it has, then it can be
removed from the programme of work to be done now, save to the extent that
the Chairman wishes to review that work to be satisfied that it has been
completed to a satisfactory standard.
