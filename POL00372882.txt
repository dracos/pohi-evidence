Hi Gayle,
Thanks for the updated version — I’ve accepted the changes so now consider this the live document.

What isn’t detailed in the changes to be implemented is Craig’s new process on precautionary suspension following audit.
Would you please add to this document applying the same principles of quantifying the benefit where appropriate. In this
scenario we should see less suspensions and as a consequence less terminations and appeals — this will be a planning
assumption but we should be able to start to identify resultant savings in Contract Advisor man hours and associated costs
eg cost of interview transcripts.

The other consideration is the Detica approach. If we were to fund the Detica proposal how do we demonstrate return on
investment ie will the Detica approach enable us to identify excess onch more speedily and more consistently than current
methods? If so at what point? What currently is the average length of time is branch could inflate their cash before we
would spot this and then act on that information? If the average cash inflation is £20k could Detica enable us to bring this
average down If so by how much?

Would you please give some thought to the areas the Detica approach (forget the price tag and the supplier at this point)
would enable us to get to the source quicker and with more rigour than our current systems / ways of working, I need to be
able to quantify the benefits of Detica and if not in absolute terms I need to have a view on what I believe will be the
benefit of an approach such as the Detica proposal.

Thanks,
Angela

Hi Angela

’'ve added in as much as I can regarding the numbers. I’ve used the data from 2012/13 as NT for 2013/14 will show more
activity happening due to the conversions. I’ve tracked the changes so you can see which bits I’ve added.

Thanks

Hi Gayle,

Martin Edwards caught up with me before I left the building earlier - he has a meeting with Paula tomorrow
(Thurs) at 3pm and wanted to give her a feel for the programme timelines. I explained we were in the process of
running the workshops so that each workstream will have a milestone plan and that ths would include what has
been introduced to date; what will be in introduced by end March 2014 and what the rolling plan looks like.

Are you able to knock something together that I am able to share with Martin before his 3pm meeting? This is
related to my earlier request so hopefuly you are already some way along having collated this for me.

Would you let me know please.

Thanks,
Angela
