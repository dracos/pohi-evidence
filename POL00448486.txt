Hi Jamie

Apologies for the delay in coming back to you. Attention has very much been on the Select Committee hearing that

happened yesterday. I am sure it’s been the same for you.

Just to confirm that we are happy with the suggested agenda below. No additions from us.

Regards.

Phil.

Hi Phil
Happy New Year to you too—hope you managed to enjoy some time off?

In terms of agenda items I suspect Nick and the Minister will want to spend some time talking about whatever measures to
overturn postmaster convictions he and the Justice Secretary are working on as the first item

Then we could follow up with updates on:

1. Compensation
2. Inquiry
3. Funding

T'll let you know if anything else comes up later this week
Many thanks,

Jamie
