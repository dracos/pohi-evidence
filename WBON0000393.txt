Gavin was away on Friday and will come back to you during Monday. Brian Altman is away but that gives you time to
discuss with Gavin, and internally, the terms of reference. I'll feed my comments into Gavin once I've reviewed the

attachments.

Dear Both

Please find attached two documents:

(1) Observations on the Terms of Reference; and
(2) Interim Review of CK's Current Process.

I hope they are what you wanted.

Have a good weekend. I am sure we shall speak on my return.

Best wishes,
Brian
