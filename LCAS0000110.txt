WITNESS STATEMENT OF ANDREW WISE

I, ANDREW WISE, of Human Resources, Capstan House, Chandlers point, 35
Broadway, Salford Quays, Salford, MSO 2PB WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS:

1. I am currently an Outlet Field Support Leader employed by Post Office Limited
(the Post Office). I have worked for the Post Office since 1991. I am
responsible for training new sub-postmasters and branch counter staff on Post
Office Transactions and procedures and the Horizon system and co-ordinating
national training issues. From May 2001 to November 2004, I was a postal officer
at the Network Business Support Centre (NBSC) working as a Tier 2 Advisor.
However due to my experience and knowledge, I was often asked to stand in as a
team leader. My responsibilities included those of a service support advisor
involved in answering calls which were generally more complex than the first tier
of calls that sub-postmasters make to the NBSC. Prior to that, I was a Horizon
field support officer from 1999 to 2001 and prior to that I spent 8 years as a
counter clerk. I have a working knowledge of the computer system known as
Horizon, which is a computerised accounting system used by the Post Office.

otherwise stated. References to page numbers in this Witness Statement are to
page numbers of Exhibit “AW1” to this Witness Statement.

Network Business Support Centre (NBSC)

The Post Office provides a service to sub-postmasters and clerks called the NBSC,
which is a helpline they can call to try to resolve business related queries.

There are two tiers of service support at NBSC. Tier one is essentially customer
services and is a separate entity. Tier two was run by the Post Office and was for
calls that tier one were unable to deal with. I understand that the tier one team
could between them take approximately 2,000 calls in total each day and at tier
two, an individual could take approximately 30 calls each day. Basically a sub-
postmaster would call the NBSC telephone number, select the options to get
through to tier one and then explain their problem. It may be a pre-recorded
standard response, but if there is none available, the sub-postmaster could get
put through to tier two. A lot of time on tier two is spent prompting sub-
postmasters and clerks to double check information they should have been
checking any way.

Double entry accounting and daily reporting procedures

1A_1209519_5 2

I have been asked to explain what Horizon is and the daily and weekly reporting
procedures that sub-postmasters must adhere to.

The counter positions in the post office branches each have a computer terminal,
this includes the processor, a touch sensitive screen, a keyboard, barcode scanner
and printer. Once a clerk logs on, any transactions they perform are recorded
and entered into the computer. The computer system is called Horizon.

Post Office branches operate double entry accounting. I think that every
transaction (apart from online banking such as withdrawing or depositing cash at
the counter) recorded by the clerk on to their computer has a corresponding
physical document, such as a TV license counter foil, savings bank deposit,
withdrawal slip or cheque.

A summary of the prescribed daily procedures that sub-postmasters must follow is
at pages 1 to 2. This includes the following:

301
LCAS0000110
LCAS0000110

TV Licenses - Non Barcoded

9. Each day the sub-postmaster must enter details on the green daily summary form
P5744 which is retained at the branch. They have to print a daily report and
check that the totals of the counter foils agree with that report. The report is
produced from information contained upon the Horizon system and shows all the
transactions of that type that have been recorded for the day. If the report and
the counter foils tally with each other, the subpostmaster cuts off the report on
the computer to reset it to zero for the next day. (‘Cut off” means that the
subpostmaster presses a button on the computer to confirm that he has
completed the report, so that when the report is next printed, it will include only
transactions done after the cut-off point). They then complete a batch control
voucher (BCV) paperclip together none barcoded TV and non barcoded over 75
counter foils to the BCV and send the counter foils off to be processed. Up until a
few years ago, they sent them to Data Central, a processing centre in London run
by the Post Office. However, I think that from around the end of March 2004
onwards there was a phased migration over to the EDS Processing Centre (EDS)
in Shepshed, Leicestershire because the task of processing was outsourced by the
Post Office to the EDS. From a branch point of view, this just meant putting the
BCV and Counterfoils in a different envelope.

10. The sub-postmaster has to print a report each day and check that the totals on
the print out agree with the documents to hand (whether cash deposit, cheque
deposit envelope or encashment cheques) if the totals agree, they then have to
cut off the report so that it resets for the next day. They then complete a BCV and
paperclip the cash deposit slips, check deposit envelopes and then encashed
cheques together and place in the envelope to go off to be processed.

Cheques, Giro bank deposits and Savings Bank

11. The sub-postmaster then goes through a similar daily procedure for cheques, giro
bank deposits and withdrawals and Savings Bank Deposits and Withdrawals i.e.
for each of these, the sub-postmaster has to print a report, check that the
cheques, giro slips, cash or other documents agree with the report, paperclip the
relevant documents together with the BCV and send them to the correct place
such as girobank, Data Central or (nowadays) EDS.

Daily Cash Declaration

12.

After the branch closes each day, the sub-postmaster has to enter details of their
cash on hand. This involves typing the quantity of each denomination they have
into their computer and then printing a cash declaration to declare the quantity of
cash in the tills overnight. (This is called the overnight cash declaration or
ONCH).

APS Transactions

13.

After the branch closes each day, the sub-postmaster has to print a report listing
that days APS transactions. APS stands for Automated Payment System and
means transactions where the customer either users a card with a magnetic strip
on it to pay a bill, or pays a bill that is barcoded. The sub-postmaster is supposed
to check that they have the correct number of APS slips and to staple the Horizon
APS Daily Report to their receipts and retain on the office.

Weekly Balance Procedure

14.

15.

Each week the sub-postmaster has to go through a weekly balancing procedure.
A summary of the current procedure is at pages 3 to é (the current procedure
refers to “Branch Trading” and “monthly Trading Statements”, which is a monthly
balancing process introduced in September 2005 to replace the weekly
procedure). Most of the balancing processes are still the same today but I have
tried to describe below the procedure as it was at the material time i.e. from
December 2003 to March 2004.

When the subpostmasters print their counter reports each day in time for the last
despatch from the branch (which could be as early as 4.00pm), they may in
practice then serve further customers and carry out further transactions that day.
Accordingly, when they do their weekly balance the subpostmaster has to
complete further copies of the counter daily reports (of the sort listed in
paragraphs 9 to 13 above) and counter weekly reports. All transactions that are
sent off weekly are classed as counter weekly reports. These include things such
as Pensions and Allowances, Green Giros, Postal Orders. These are listed on the
Weekly Balancing hand out. The reports look the same as those produced for
Daily reports. They are then encouraged to print a balance snapshot and use that
to ensure that the Horizon system stock held figures matches the actual stock
holdings in their branch. They also have to check all receipt and payment
transaction totals with the supporting vouchers/documentation. There are ways
in which they can amend any stock discrepancies. They then have to print the
mandatory office weekly reports being the suspense account report and rejected

postage label report. These are produced off the A4 printer and retained in the
branch with the cash account.

The sub-postmaster then completes all other manual summaries and
reconciliations, for example National Savings Weekly Summary, Change Given
Return, Electric Tokens, Promotional/Payment Vouchers, MVL Weekly
Reconciliation, Rod Licence Reconciliation, Gift Voucher Weekly Reconciliation,
DVLA Premium Service Summaries, UK PA Check and Send summaries, Electric

Schemes and National Lottery Cheque Prize Payments.

If a branch has an On Demand Bureau de Change, the sub-postmaster then prints
a foreign currency report and checks the figures against their actual stock
holdings.

They then make new declarations for cash and stamps, entering on the system
the cash nominations they have and a number of each different type of stamps.
They then print a report which is kept with their branch.

The office then produces a Trial Balance report, if all the cash stock and figures
are correct and once the National Lottery figures have been entered the office can
then be rolled over and a Final Balance report is produced which the sub-
postmaster should sign and stamp with the date.

Each week, the sub-postmaster sends to Chesterfield the paid postal and money
orders slips, a Giro Bank Change Summary (the Post Office offers a change giving
service to customers that bank with Girobank and this is a summary of how many
transactions are done), UKPA Check and Send (if they do the Passport Check and
Send service, which would be unlikely in a sub post office), a form setting out
Redeemed Post Office and TV Savings Stamps, National Lottery prize payments
(£500 plus) (which shows details of what cheques have been issued to National
Lottery winners where the prize is more than £500) and DVLA premium service
forms (which is a service where a customer can apply for a photo card driving
licence at the Post office). The branch checks the form and ID and sends it off.

After everything has been completed and the office is happy with the balance they
will then complete the weekly Cash Account report. 2 copies are produced and
signed. 1 of these copies is sent to Transaction Processing at Chesterfield and the
other is retained in the office. At pages 7) to ea ig a copy of a Cash Account from
the Marine Drive branch for week 50 (the week ending 11 March 2004), by way of

an example.

The Horizon System

22. Accordingly, it can be seen that if the clerk or sub-postmaster makes a mistake
when imputing transaction details into their computer, there are a number of
points at which this can be picked up, because there are daily and weekly reports
that the sub-postmaster have to produce at which stage they have to check and
satisfy themselves that the physical documents evidencing transactions, (for
example cheques, giros, pensions and allowances) match what they have entered
on the system. In addition to that, there are various teams responsible for
different sorts of paperwork produced by the branch, including a giro bank team,
cheques team and pension team. For example, if the clerk records an item
incorrectly on the system, they should pick this up on either their daily or weekly
report. However if they fail to do so, this will be picked up at the Processing
Centre. If an item has been wrongly recorded, an error notice would be
generated, although this can easily take up to 12 weeks or so. This will mean
that if a transaction has been over or under stated there will be either a claim or

charge error respectively.

Sub-Postmaster Training

23. As previously stated, I am currently responsible for training new sub-postmasters
and branch counter staff on Horizon. The training includes how to use the Horizon
system and would include a lot of transaction based procedures such as - Cheque
acceptance, Girobank, National Savings, pensions and Allowances, Postage, TV
licences, letters and parcels and Personal banking. It also covers subjects like
customer care and security, Health and Safety, how to use the counter operation
manuals and procedures such as the daily accounting and (at the time in
question) weekly balancing.

24. In the training delivery team we have a record of Mr Castleton becoming
subpostmaster on 18 July 2003 and that he was offered 4 days training from the
14 to 17 July at our classroom in Leeds. Mr Castleton then had a trainer on site
with him from 18 to 25 July 2004.

25. Each branch has a copy of the Horizon User Guide which is a reference tool and
explains how to use Horizon, (such as balancing, administration, reports, transfers
remittances and transactions) and a Horizon Operations Manual which gives
guidance on products such as girobank, national savings accounts, personal
banking, corporate banking, cash and cheques acceptance, pensions and counter
operations. In addition, literature such as Operation Focus a weekly magazine
circulated to all branches and operational Workaid, a similar magazine but

1A a209519.5 6 — 305

LCAS0000110

circulated as and when there are more major changes to products, prices or
procedures, help keep branches abreast of developments.

NBSC Review in January and February 2004

26.

27.

28.

29.

Sarah Pennington (who has since left the Post Office) was the Tier 2 advisor who
dealt with some of the calls raised by this office at around the end of January
2004. At that time and during these calls she discussed the issues with me. I do
not now remember all of the details of this case but have refreshed my memory
from reviewing the NBSC call logs and the email dated 20 April 2004 from Andrew
Price (NBSC) to Catherine Oglesby (who was then Mr Castleton’s Retail Line
Manager) (page 13). rp,

p224

That e-mail records that Sarah Pennington had spoken to the sub-postmaster at
Marine Drive (in or around January or February 2004) who wasn’t sure what was
causing the errors and that he had been using the slave computer terminal to
enter his stock and cash, which he was told would not cause a problem as long as
it was attached to the correct stock unit. If there was any communication
problem between the two computers, the words “node disconnected” would flash
up on screen when any reports were produced.

The sub-postmaster apparently thought there were some errors relating to the
National Lottery. I am reminded from the e-mail that Sarah phoned the lottery
team at transaction processing who confirmed that there were some errors in the
timing of the recording of receipts. For example, one week the branch would fail
to enter the details of some lottery receipts into Horizon, but the next week the
branch would compensate for this by overstating the receipts. The most likely
explanation for these discrepancies is that they were caused by the late entry of
the lottery cash receipts on to the Horizon computer, if the shop stayed open later
than the Post Office counter. Accordingly, for every charge error there was a
corresponding claim error as the clerk and/or sub-postmaster had simply entered
the lottery figures in the wrong cash account period. If the cash account period
(week number) is wrong one week, the next week this would balance out, hence
the sub-postmaster would receive a charge error in the first week and a claim

error in the second week.

The email records that the sub-postmaster was also concerned that when entering
the lottery figures, the terminals did not appear to be communicating. However if
that had been the case, the sub-postmaster would have a very large number of
errors on every report and product.

LCAS0000110

In February 2004, I looked at the cash account information that the sub-
postmaster sent to Sarah, but I was unable to find any errors. The only amount I
questioned was a large amount on the cheques to Processing Centre, but I was
able to confirm that this was a cheque payment for the purchase of premium
bonds. Accordingly, there was nothing more NBSC could do. I note from our
email of 20 April 2004 (but do not recall saying this myself) that NBSC suggested
to Mr Castleton to work a manual system at the side of Horizon to see if any
problems were highlighted. He was also advised to take a snapshot before and
after he did the “REMs” (as defined below) to see if there were any problems

occurring when he did a remittance.

When a subpostmaster receives a delivery of cash and/or stock, he enters the
details and quantity into his computer and this is called “remming in” the stock).
The cash and stock are delivered to the office in a grey pouch by the Cash in
Transit driver. The subpostmaster would sign a docket to say that they have
received this pouch (each pouch had a reference number and this tied up with
what the cash centre had put in the pouch, so the driver never knew what was in
each pouch). The subpostmaster would then open the pouch and there would be
an advice note in the pouch listing what cash or stock should be in that pouch.
The subpostmaster had 24 hours to check that the amount agreed with the advice
note (if it did not he had to contact the Rem Unit within 24 hours of receiving the
pouch). The subpostmaster would then rem this amount into the Horizon system
and it produced a “rem in” slip that was attached to the advice note and was
retained in the branch with all other paper work. (This procedure changed around
August 2004 to an automated system where the barcodes on the pouches were
scanned in on Horizon and the value was automatically entered on the system).

Although I do not now recall it, our email suggests (and I believe) that we
concluded that the Horizon system was working properly and did not appear to be
the cause of the unauthorised losses incurred.

I can see from the NBSC call logs that on 4 March 2004 Mrs Oglesby asked NBSC
for information of calls made to the NBSC from the Marine Drive branch relating
to losses when balancing and what investigations were undertaken by NBSC
during these calls. I helped Sarah Pennington to prepare an email that Andrew
Price (NBSC) could (and did) forward to Mrs Oglesby on 20 April 2004 to explain
what investigations had by that time already been carried out (page 13).

below - FAD code 213337. These were compiled during the ordinary course of
business from information supplied by employees of NBSC who have or may
reasonably be supposed to have personal knowledge of the matter dealt with in
the information supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of the
information or cannot be traced. Although I was involved in assisting with the
NBSC investigation of the Marine Drive branch queries, I probably dealt with very
few of these calls (if any at all) and accordingly the information set out below is
based on my interpretation (from experience) of what is written in the call logs
and is provided simply to help clarify them for the benefit of the Court.

As appears from the above call logs below, there were a total of 88 NBSC call logs
relating to the Marine Drive branch for the period December 2003 to April 2004.
Out of these 88 calls, 62 calls appear to be concerned with minor issues. Of the
remainder for the period from December 2003 to 23 March 2004:

(a) 11 calls, being those on 14, 21, 22 (2 calls), 29 (2 calls) and 30
January, 12, 13 and 26 February and 8 March 2004 (each marked with
a * sign) appear to relate purely to the issue of losses;

(b) 11 further calls, being those on 29 and 30 January, 13, 16 (3 calls), 24
and 25 February and 23 March 2004 (3 calls) (each marked with a +
sign) appear to relate purely to computer issues of various sorts; and

(c) 4 further calls, being those on 28 January, 25 and 26 February and 4
March (each marked with a # sign) appear to raise issues relating to
both the losses and computer system.

None of the call logs themselves revealed the existence of any computer
faults, although the subpostmaster did in some calls say that he thought that
he was having computer problems. «

1 December 2003, call reference H12881564 (page 14) the sub-postmaster
wanted to know where they sent their application for telephone claims. The
resolution was stated to be KB which means that an answer was provided from
the knowledge base. Given the volume and variety of calls to NBSC, the KB is a
tool used by NBSC to find information and give answers to subpostmasters. It as
a bit like a computerised library for the P.O or a more tailored and sophisticated
version of “Frequently Asked Questions” that you often see on websites and
enables NBSC to effectively apply and maintain consistent service standards
across the board when dealing with subpostmaster queries. The NBSC advisor
will use a system called “Remedy” (which is the system used to log calls and is
linked to the KB) to categorise a call made by a subpostmaster. If the correct

categorisation is used, then the system should give the advisor the answer to the
question. This is because when NBSC search on the knowledge base, there is
taxonomy or “case titles” to help choose answers from and they select which one
you want to see. The answer is displayed in a Microsoft Word document. For
example, the case title for the above question could be “What are the Contact
Details for Telephone Claims.”

do not have any further information regarding the changes to the Ordinary Saving
Account other than information contained in MBS 453. MBS stands for “Message
Broadcast System”. When urgent information needs to be sent the network a MBS
is sent out direct to all Post Office branches to their Horizon system. MBS 453 is
the number of the MBS sent out. I do not have a copy of this and doubt whether
they would be kept from 3 years ago, but in any event it would only hold
information relating to National savings Ordinary Account.

subpostmaster said. From memory, I believe that the advice on the KB for an
office that misbalanced was that the subpostmaster should check all cash stamps
and stock, check rems and cheques to processing centre rems, and check
pensions and allowances and other documentation.

28 January 2004, call reference H13003838 (page 27) the sub-postmaster

# 28 January 2004, call reference H21272735 (page 28) the sub-postmaster
had called to say that since he had broadband installed, every time he receives
stock into his office it was showing short by the same amount. He had checked to
make sure that it was remmed in properly but it was still showing £2,500 short.
After NBSC spoke to the sub-postmaster, it appeared that he was entering all the
transactions correctly, so the sub-postmaster was advised that if he felt that that
was a technical system problem he should call the Horizon System Helpline (HSH)
that deals with technical issues, so that they could investigate. The NBSC advisor
would have gone through the rem procedure with the subpostmaster and it looks
like he established he was remming the cash in correctly. He was advised to
“palance and roll for a definite figure” i.e. to produce a trial balance, since it is
only at this stage you can get an accurate picture of what the value of the
discrepancy is and to call HSH if he didn’t have any success.

discrepancy in as many weeks. NBSC checked through the figures using a

team to review.

notified the suspense Account Team that the branch had an unauthorised or
unidentified loss of £6,754.09. The Suspense Account Team would then contact
the office to determine if it was an unidentified loss and they would decide if the
sub-postmaster is authorised to hold the loss or not.

wanted to have his transactional archives (presumably to try to identify what was
going wrong at his branch). Horizon only holds about 30 days worth of data and
after this period all the transaction data is archived by Fujitsu. The Post Office can
request office archived data from Fujitsu. He was having a lot of losses over the
past three weeks and thought that there was a system fault with his remittances.

generated this call. The log recalls that there was a loss of £8,243.10 in week 46
accumulated over the last four weeks. The Suspense Account team may have
chased the sub-postmaster for an I&E form (the form used to apply for hardship)
on 27 February 2004. There was a further loss of £3,509.68 in week 48. This
was added to the suspense account and the total loss was now £11,752.78. Mrs

Conclusion

115.

43% 49324
Having reviewed the email dated 20 April 2004 (page 13), I can see that we did
not find anything to suggest that the Horizon system was not working properly
or causing the unauthorised losses. The NBSC call logs do not themselves
reveal the existence of any computer faults.

I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.
