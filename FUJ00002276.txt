(a) amendment(s) to the Transaction time benchmark target time(s) arising out of
agreed Business Capabilities and Support Facilities changes resulting from the
implementation of a Change Request under the Change Control Procedure including
reasons for any such adjustment;

(b) the new Transaction time benchmark system component and aggregate times
relating to the Release under examination;

(c) the variance between the new Transaction time benchmark times and the
Transaction time benchmark target times; and

(d) the variance between the new Transaction time benchmark times and the previous
Transaction time benchmark times.

The data recording part of the Transaction time benchmark evaluation is carried out prior to
the implementation of a Release. This is not to say that the Software implementation is
dependant in any way upon the Transaction time benchmark exercise or the results arising
there from. It is the successful completion of testing, which is conducted under the control
and management of Post Office that leads to the implementation of the Software into the
live environment as described in the CCD entitled: TST/GEN/STG/0001 “HNG-X Testing
Strategy’.

The Transaction Time Benchmarking Service comprises Transaction time benchmark
evaluation of individual Business Capabilities and Support Facilities component times
defined in the Working Document entitled: “Transaction Time Benchmarking, Joint Working
Document” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0017).

The Business Capabilities and Support Facilities component times are generated from the
execution of a representative set of Transactions on a test rig within a test environment
representing a real Post Office Branch as far as is reasonably practicable, with normal
counter operation.

The outcomes of the Transaction time benchmark evaluation are compared against the
counter system component target times and the results of the previous Transaction time
benchmark evaluation. Any adverse variances are analysed and explained as far as is
practicable.

The initial Transaction time benchmark evaluation results shall be presented to Post Office
for review within six (6) weeks of the commencement of the implementation of the Release
in question

The final Transaction time benchmark results are formally presented to Post Office in
accordance with the Working Document entitled: “Counter Transaction Time Performance -
measurement and results”.

Regardless of whether the results of the Transaction time benchmarking exercise have
been delivered, in the event that a Release is implemented and there is an obvious
degradation in performance in terms of Transaction times and such degradation is visible to
Users at the Branch and reported to the Service Desk, the Incident identified by Fujitsu
Services as causing the degradation will be resolved in accordance with the Incident and
problem management process set out in section 2.1.2 of the Service Management Service,
Service Description and the Working Document entitled: “POA Incident Management
Process” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018). To the extent that any such Incident is caused directly by
any action of Fujitsu Services in breach of its obligations under this Agreement, the
resolution of that Incident will be at Fujitsu Services’ cost.

The Transaction time benchmark target times, where applicable and carried forward to the
next Release are subject to a five (5) per cent uplift with each Release to accommodate the

likely increase in system contention arising from increased functionality and complexity
inherent in the Release.

Whenever an agreed system change affects one or more of the measured system
components, the Transaction time benchmark target times shall be reviewed and amended
by agreement between Fujitsu Services and Post Office (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

The Transaction time benchmark target times may also be changed as the result of an
agreement between Post Office and Fujitsu Services to change the Transaction time
benchmarking method. Under such circumstances Transaction Time Benchmark Credits
gained under the previous Transaction time benchmarking method shall be carried forward.

When, on completion of a Transaction time benchmark evaluation, the counter system
component timings prove to be greater than the Transaction time benchmark target times,
this shall be deemed a “Transaction Time Benchmark Time Discrepancy”.

In the event of a Transaction Time Benchmark Time Discrepancy the following provisions
shall apply:

(a) Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall agree (such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld) a method of rectification, including a timetable, (a “Rectification Plan’) for
each Benchmark Time Discrepancy (which plan may involve the agreement of an
adjustment to the Transaction time benchmark target times);

(b) if the Rectification Plan requires changes to be made to the provisions of the
Agreement including any CCD or Contract Referenced Document (CRD) changes
shall be made pursuant to the Change Control! Procedure;

(c) any changes to the HNG-X Service Infrastructure required to rectify a Transaction
Time Benchmark Time Discrepancy shall be made at no charge to Post Office;

(d) each Transaction Time Benchmark Time Discrepancy shall not be a Default unless
the Transaction Time Benchmark Time Discrepancy is material and within ninety
(90) Working Days after the identification of that Transaction Time Benchmark Time
Discrepancy the Parties have failed to reach agreement upon a Rectification Plan
and the Transaction Time Benchmark Time Discrepancy has not been rectified by
Fujitsu Services. In such a circumstance that material Transaction Time Benchmark
Time Discrepancy shall become a Default upon expiry of that ninety (90) Working
Day period; and

(e) a failure by Fujitsu Services to comply with a Rectification Plan (and therefore fail to
rectify the Transaction Time Benchmark Time Discrepancy) shall be a Default.
