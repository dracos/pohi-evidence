Cc Signature G Burrows

Iam employed by Post Office Ltd a part of the Royal Mail Group as an Audit Manager
working within the Security & Audit section and have been so employed for
approximately 12 years though have been employed by the Post Office for about 22

years.

The role of the audit team is to carry out routine audits of Post Office Branches in order
to carry out verification of cash and stock as well as conduct certain compliance checks.
At times audits are specifically requested by the Retail Line Manager or by members of

the Investigation section.

On Monday 13" January 2003, I received a phone call from Mr Colin Price a member of
the Post Office Ltd Investigation team who requested a special audit to be carried out at

Rugeley Post office on Tuesday 14 January 2003.

On Tuesday 14" January 2003, I was part of a team of four auditors who attended
Rugeley MSPO, 18 Anson Street, Rugeley WS15 2BF on the request of the Investigation

section, this team was lead by myself and I was responsible for overseeing the audit and

the input of data into the Horizon computer system in order to complete the office cash

account.

One of the initial actions I would perform at such an audit is to log onto the Horizon
computer system and request an ‘office snapshot’ printout. I can confirm that I
requested such a printout at 0831 hours on 14" January 2003, I produce this printout as
item number GB/01. The office snap shot printout provides a summary of all of the
cash and stock which should be held at the office at the time of the printout, it will also
provide a summary of all receipts and payments in relation to transactions conducted at
the Post Office since the beginning of business on Thursday 9" January 2003 up until

the time of the requested printout.

For instance the office snapshot, GB/01, states that the amount of cash that should be
present at the office at 0831 hours on 14th January 2003 is £125,458.72. It also provides
the sterling value of the amount of Foreign currency that should be on hand at the office
at that time of £389,005.30.

It is then a process of verify the cash and stock which is actually on hand at the Post

office and seeing if it agrees with the office snapshot.

I was made aware early on during the audit of the office by Mr Manish Patel, of the
Investigation team, that several cheques to the value of £638,675.65 had been removed
from the Bureau Till by the Police, therefore this amount immediately became a known

office shortage as the cheques were physically not on hand at the office.

Continuation of statement of Glyn Burrows

As each team member verified particular stock units, the results were provided to me
and I collated our findings via the P32 accounting sheet on my laptop. In particular, Mr
Kevin Orgill carried out a verification of the ‘AM’ stock unit and Ms Alison Edwards

carried out the verification of the Bureau Stock unit (BU).

In relation to the ‘AM’ stock unit, I was made aware by Mr Orgill that the Horizon
snapshot (K0/01) in relation to this stock unit indicated that there should be £282,000
worth of foreign currency, however, this amount was not on hand, there were also

some other discrepancies found in this stock unit by Mr Orgill. .

As the declared figure £282,000 related to an entry against Foreign currency, it was
decided that this amount should be transferred to the Bureau (BU) stock unit as I was

already aware that there would be a shortage in this stock due to the removal of the

_I ‘above mentioned cheques. I also provided Alison with a figure in relation to the

missing cheques. Alison required this information in order to balance the Bureau stock,
the reason for Alison needing this information was that the overall discrepancy would
be transferred to our accounting team in Chesterfield known as Late Accounts, who

deal with the recovery of assets.

The reason for transferring the amount to late account was that we were not in
possession of the cheques and we did not know at the time if when presented the
cheques would be honoured. If the cheques were honoured then the amount would be
credited to the same late account to be offset against the discrepancy declared during

our Audit of accounts.

As each stock unit was verified it would then be ‘balanced’ and any shortages or

surplus found were adjusted with the main ‘AM’ stock unit, which as a result
ultimately balanced showing a shortage of £ 3086.39.

The Bureau stock unit was finalised and showed a shortage of £642,258.79 which was
made up of the value of the missing cheques (£638,675.65) plus an additional £3,583.14
which was differences in sterling and currency on hand compared with the Horizon

snapshot for that stock unit.

Therefore the audit declared a total shortage for the office of £645,345.18, which was the

amount, transferred to Late account.

At 1406 hours I produced another Horizon office snapshot which now showed the new
figures following the verification carried out by my team, as a result it can be seen that
the amount of cash on hand was now £123,649.03 as opposed to £125,458.72 as indicated
on the earlier printout GB/01, a difference of £1,809.69 and the foreign currency on
hand as verified by my team was now £22,938.72 as opposed to £389,005.30 as indicated
on the earlier printout GB/01, a difference of £366,066.58. Inow produce this Horizon
snapshot printout as item number GB/02. I can also confirm that the writing that
appears at the top of this printout is that of my colleagues Mr Kevin Watkins, which
shows the office shortage figure of 645345.18.

As mentioned previously I would also input the relevant data onto an electronic P32a
spreadsheet using my laptop computer, which indicates cash and stock figures as well
as figures in relation to transactions performed that week, It also shows the final audit
balance of the office, which in this case was a shortage of £645,345.18, I now produce a

printout of the electronic P32a form as item number GB/03.
