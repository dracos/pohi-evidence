Jarnail will look into this.

They are looking at cases going back to
2010

Also looking at all cases from Scotland —
all information will be compiled on a
spread sheet

Ruth Barker | Communications | Mentioned piece in The Telegraph, where
MPs were vocal about Horizon and
constituents, but that these didn’t form
part of the 47 cases referred to 2.4
Sight.

Concerned that there was no definitive
list of all cases that MPs currently have
or may in the future enquire about.

Rob King Security Stated that we need close working
relationship with Security and Contract
Teams, in all cases engagement with
contract manager as early as possible and
the teams need to be joined up.

Rob King Security Pointed out that is was likely that
offenders previously dealt with for non-
Horizon issues, such as ATM
investigations may now allege a
miscarriage of justice.

The following to be invited to attend future conference calls,
with each team/function responsible for ensuring a
representative is present.
