Update

Final Update

Reception hours are still 9-5. It is
common practice to leave up until 6pm
via reception but you have to wait for an
existing member of staff to leave to
utilise swipe facility. More practical
solution would be to leave via RM
entrance, no swipe card necessary, and
car park barrier still in operation at
these times.
