Absolutely not. On Friday, the spmr refused to sign off a settlement he had proposed and
consequently this case is going to trial.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Just to confirm the case is still going to trial starting on 4 December 2006. We are
endeavouring to agree a sensible trial timetable with Mr Castleton's solicitors and I will update
you again as soon as I am able.

In the meantime, if there are any dates when you cannot make it which you have not already
given me, please let me know and copy in my colleague Tom Bourne

Kind regards.

Subject: Trial Date: Post Office Limited -v- Mr L Castleton

Ladies and Gentlemen,

There was been a procedural hearing at Court yesterday to review the timetable on this case
and set new directions.

The Master decided that, amongst other things, the trial must proceed in December

2006. Accordingly, it will commence on 4 December 2006 and will probably last 7 to 10 days.
It will take place at the Royal Courts of Justice, London. As previously indicated, please could
everyone who has given a witness statement blank out two weeks in your diaries starting on 4
December 2006 and keep these dates free for the time being. You will not be required to
attend for the whole of that time and we liaise with Mr Castleton's solicitors:

1. to agree that as many of you as possible should not have to attend Court to give oral
evidence. (For example, I'm hoping to persuade them that most if not all of our witnesses from
P.O Chesterfield and P.O Leeds should not attend. If they agree, this will help shorten the trial
and save costs); and

2. for those of you that are needed to attend, we have a timetable, so we can give you a
specific time for when you will be required to be there to keep the inconvenience to a minimum.

I will keep you fully updated as and when I hear further, which is likely to be some time after
10 November at the earliest.

In the meantime, if there are any particular dates from the 2 weeks commencing 4 December
2006 onwards when you definitely cannot attend Court, please let me know as soon as possible.

I look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards.

Yours sincerely

Stephen Dilley
