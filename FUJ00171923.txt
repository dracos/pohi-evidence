Problem Statement ( Underlying cause of problem):

We have done a EUM CP(CP2144) few months back which introduced this functionality of concurrent
logon. As this is a new feature there are some business scenarios we didn?t took into account last time and
that?s how we got this bug. Now we have identified a few bugs in concurrent logon scenarios and we will
also be doing ?CP2368 EUM Balancing Enhancements? in a few days to address all the design issues.

A bug in 7BAD123BLO Attach User To Stock Unit.pdl? was causing the issue. Previously we were not
passing the ?attachedUser? from the pdl to the message fragment in the business scenario and due to this
placeholder variable in the message fragment could not be resolved during execution of the business
scenario.

Risk of not fixing: If we don?t fix this issue then the message we are getting during business scenario
doesn?t make any sense as we are not getting any value for placeholder variable.

Benefit of fixing: MSG30002 makes sense because placeholder is now being replaced with actual value.

logged on, and gives an error message (MSG30002) if they are, showing in the message the user name that is already logged on.

Inf that check passes, the clerk choses the stock unit to attach to and calls the data centre to action this. The data centre
performs the performs various checks. In particular, if the user to be attached is not the current user, a check is made that the
t logged on.

leroblem Statement ( Underlying cause of problem): Following the EUM investigation, it has been found that if the check fails on
loc level when user is trying to change the stock unit they are attached to the error message they are getting is missing their
name.

such scenario in unlikely but possible.

hen the clerk choses a user to change the stock unit they are attached to, the counter performs a check to see if that user is
hogged on, and gives an error message (MSG30002) if they are, showing in the message the user name that is already logged on.

I'f that check passes, the clerk choses the stock unit to attach to and calls the Data Centre to action this. The Data Centre
jperforms various checks, in particular, if the user to be attached is not the current user, a check is made that the user is not
flogged on.

Ite the final check fails, MSG30002 is displayed by the counter, but in this case there is a bug that it does not display the user
Iname but instead display the substituion variable name with percent delimiters.

Risk of not fixing: If this is not fixed then the message we are getting during business scenario doesn't make much sense.
Benefit of fixing. MSG30002 explains what the problem is because placeholder is now being replaced with actual user name.
