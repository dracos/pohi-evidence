Government Cuts FUJITSU

™@ Fujitsu's shares plunge in Tokyo after slashing full year profit
forecast

The shares fell 9.4 percent to 494 yen on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, the biggest intraday decline since January 2009.

“Fiscal tightening among European governments, particularly the
UK, which Fujitsu is highly exposed to along with generally weak
IT spending environment at home leaves its next term’s earnings
outlook with more negative surprises”

Amir Anvarzadeh, BGC Partners Asian equity sales team, London,
28" January 2011 after Fujitsu reported earnings.
