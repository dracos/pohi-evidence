I will now carry out further review work and will contact you on the [date of next contact] to

explain what will happen next. I will then contact you regularly during the course of the
suspension period to provide you with any further updates relating to this matter and
answer any questions or concerns you may have. It is the intention to keep the period of

your suspension to a minimum. In order for us to do this it is important [you/the Operator]
assist by co-operating fully and in a timely manner with any request made.

Please note:

e Weill continue to pay [your / the Operator's] fees during the period of suspension.
. [You/The Operator] will receive all information in connection to the suspension.
e During the period of suspension [you/the Operator] are not excluded from the

premises but you will have no access to Post Office equipment. As a precautionary
measure the SMART User IDs for XXX [has/have] been deactivated with effect from
XXXX.

. [You/The Operator] may, if you wish, contact your NFSP representative to support
you through the process. The NFSP can be contacted oni }

Alternatively, you may wish to arrange legal representation or other support.

Appointment of a Temporary Operator

As discussed and in order to minimise the impact of any suspension period we can attempt
to find a Temporary Operator for the Post Office (but only with your express permission). It

was agreed [note any relevant information in connection to the conversation about
appointing a Temporary Operator]. Please note, a Temporary Operator will only be able to
operate with [your/the Operator's] express permission and [you/the Operator] and the

Temporary Postmaster will be responsible for negotiating the commercial arrangements
between you. We are unable to guarantee that we will be able to appoint a Temporary
Operator.

It is important that I stress the suspension does not mean the Agreement has been
terminated. However, Post Office Ltd does reserve its rights in full. Noting this, I am mindful

the impact that this process may have so I remind you that Post Office offers wellbeing

support helpline, either by phone porat
http://postmaster.workplacewellbeing.com. In addition to this support is also available

through the NFSP.
