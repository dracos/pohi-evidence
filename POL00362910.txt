1 Overview

1.1 Introduction by the Standard Owner

Post Office is committed to protecting its employees, customers, Third Party Supply Chain
and information assets from damaging or illegal actions by individuals, either knowingly
or unknowingly. Post Office enables this through the development and deployment of
policies, standards and guidelines which are aligned to international best practices.
Effective cyber and information security is a team effort involving everyone in Post Office.

1.2 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to state a minimum security baseline to ensure encryption
controls are applied, where appropriate. This must incorporate effective key management
controls and practices to ensure strong key lifecycle management controls vital to guarding
against key compromise.

The objective of this standard is to ensure:

e Technical and procedural standards are defined for the safe, efficient and effective
deployment of cryptographic services in support of business objectives.

« The use of encryption keys does not expose Post Office to crypto-analysis or brute
force key cracking to compromise the data.

« Stored encrypted data can be retrieved and decrypted even if the ordinary method
of decrypting data is not possible.

e The distribution of keys to known entities that are authorised to access the
encrypted data is controlled and managed.

To ensure compliance to the business requirements, and items which are subject to legal
and regulatory related encryption requirements, specific control requirements for the
handling of Payment Card Industry - Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), Data Protection
Act 2018 and Government data must be included.

The following requirements will be implemented, where appropriate:

e Encryption for transmission, (data-in-motion).
e Encryption for storage, (data-at-rest).

Encryption solutions will be subject to approval by IT Security and must be fully
documented when applied to any Post Office managed service.

1.3 Core Principles

To ensure appropriate use and management of encryption controls, (e.g. preserve the
integrity of sensitive information and confirm the identity of the originator of
transactions or communications).

To work towards meeting this objective it is essential that the following actions are
performed:

e Aset of business requirements must be gathered and documented.
e <Asecurity assessment by IT Security must be performed and documented.

INTERNAL Page 3 of 15 Encryption Standard

« A Data Privacy Impact Assessment must be performed and documented.

Based on a review of the above outputs, determine if cryptographic controls are
required.

1.4 Application

This standard applies to any service provided to the Post office where Post Office data or
data processed by the Post Office on behalf of third parties is in transit or at rest.

4 Cryptographic Provision Guidance

POL00362910
POL00362910

Where cryptographic services are required, only approved cryptographic solutions (i.e.

tools, processes, algorithms, and key lengths) are to be used.

The approved algorithms can be found in section 5 Minimum Requirements.

There will be a documented cryptography security and key lifecycle management solution

that will consist of, at a minimum, the following:

4.1

Effective security governance arrangements of cryptographic controls, when used
to reduce information risk and securing of data.
Operation of the service with a view to good industry standard security practices,
ensuring operational management processes and procedures (i.e. cryptographic
keys and digital certificates) used by the technologies.
Safeguard encryption keys with at least one, if not all, of the following options:
o Encryption key files within an encryption key management system.
o Encryption key files with a trusted third party through an agreed escrow
service.
Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined and individuals with the required
expertise fulfil each role.
Policies, processes, procedures and implementation mechanisms must be in place
for encrypting sensitive information when required for:
o Data-at-rest (e.g. information systems, application, databases and
endpoints).
o Data-in-motion (e.g. system interfaces, electronic messaging, and
untrusted networks).
o Integrity.
o Non-repudiation.
Digital certificates deployed comply with the X.509 standard.
Strong cryptographic and security protocols are regularly reviewed to identify any
risks or vulnerabilities.

Public Key Infrastructure

A documented process for managing cryptographic keys must be established which
includes the following:

Generation of cryptographic keys using industry recommended key lengths (see
section 4 ‘Minimum Requirements’ for further details).
Secure distribution, activation, storage, recovery and replacement/update of

cryptographic keys.

Immediate revocation (deactivation) of cryptographic keys (e.g. if a key is

compromised, or a key owner changes job or leaves the Post Office). Management
of cryptographic keys that may have been compromised, such as by disclosure to
an external party.

Recovery of cryptographic keys that are lost, corrupted or have expired.
Backup/archive of cryptographic keys and the maintenance of cryptographic key
history (e.g. to allow access to backed up or archived information).

Allocation of defined activation/de-activation dates.

Restriction of access to cryptographic keys to authorised individuals.

Post Office Limited - Document Classification: CONFIDENTIAL

e The encryption solution should not allow for or accept substitution of keys coming
from unauthorized sources or unexpected processes

e Sharing of cryptographic keys (e.g. using split key generation) required for
protecting sensitive information and critical systems.

e Actions to be taken in the event of loss or compromise of the public key
infrastructure.

e Establishment of a root Certification Authority (CA) and one or more subsidiary CAs
(sub-CAs). Use of Post Office root CA to sign sub-CA’s, which will be used to
produce operational cryptographic material.

e Methods of protecting important internal CAs (and related sub-CAs).

e Integration of the public key infrastructure with business applications and technical
infrastructure that will use it.

e Establishment of one or more Registration Authorities (RAs).

4.2 Risk-based Assessments

The selection and implementation of a cryptographic solution must take into account the
following:

e Assessing the risks (including legal risks) associated with using cryptographic
solutions (including encryption algorithms).

e Identifying legal obligations (for relevant jurisdictions).

e Identify the data types (e.g. PCI-DSS, client, customer, business, HR data etc.).

e Identify data that is hosted and communicated (e.g. at-rest and/or in-motion).

IT Security are responsible for:

e Approving the use of cryptographic solutions.

e Approving the assignment of responsibilities for cryptographic solutions.

« Providing advice regarding conflicting laws and regulations (including dealing with
license issues) relating to the use of encryption (cryptographic solutions) in
different jurisdictions.

e Reviewing compliance and providing input into the requirements to ensure the
technology supports future capabilities.

4.3 Key Management

Ensure that the security of the encrypted data by the cryptographic scheme cannot be
undermined by malicious intent directed at the key management process, protecting
access to the keys in storage that could be used to compromise trust in the cryptographic
scheme.

Key management should address the following stages of the lifecycle:
Key generation

Key registration

Key storage

Key distribution and installation

Key use

Key rotation

Key backup

Key recovery

Key revocation

4.4 Compromise of Cryptographic Material

The Post Office must be informed of any known breach or compromise of a cryptographic
key or certificate as this is classed as a potential Security Incident. All Security Incidents
must to be reported using the agreed Incident Management Process, which will be
managed in accordance with contractual obligations.

In order to contain any potential impact to the integrity and confidentiality of Post Office
data, all compromised cryptographic keys or certificates may need to be revoked and
replaced, subject to completion of evidence gathering as part of any forensic investigation.

4.5 PCI-DSS

All payment cardholder data in scope for PCI-DSS must be encrypted in accordance with
the current PCI-DSS standards
