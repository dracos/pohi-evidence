Rodric
One to just keep on your radar — this is the draft note explaining how Horizon data can / cannot be accessed.

There's no immediate pressure to get this one completed but SS are going to keep raising this question until we give
them a definitive answer.

The pieces of missing information are around FJ injecting transactions. For Old Horizon, we need to understand how
difficult it will be for FJ to determine whether a transaction has ever been injected. For Horizon Online, we need a few
more details around what happened during the one known instance of an injected transaction. I think this info needs
to come from FJ in both cases.

Kind regards
Andy

First draft of the note attached — thoughts?
I've intentionally not referred to the "Winn/Lusher" email as it distracts from what is otherwise a very clear picture.

I suggest that you, me and FJ get the attached doc near to final form before we escalate to Angela, Chris and Belinda
for approval. It is probably then best that this document is sent by Angela to SS.

My hope is that this will hopefully put this matter to bed with SS and we will not need to escalate to the WG. However,
we'll not know that answer until we see the SS thematic report.

Subject: RE: Strictly Private & Confidential - Subject to Privilege

Rodric,
Please see Fujitsu’s response below.

Summary:

e There is no ability to delete or change records a branch creates in either old Horizon or Horizon online.
Transactions in both systems are created in a secure and auditable way to assure integrity, and have either
a checksum (Old Horizon) or a digital signature (Horizon Online), are time stamped, have a unique
sequential number and are securely stored via the core audit process in the audit vault

e Whilst a facility exists to ‘inject’ additional transactions in the event of a system error, these transactions
would have a signature that is unique, sub-postmaster id’s are not used and the audit log would house a
record of these. As above, this does not delete or amend original transactions but creates a new and
additional transactions

* This facility is built into the system to enable corrections to be made if a system error / bug is identified
and the master database needs updating as a result, this is not a unique feature of Horizon

e Approvals to ‘inject’ new transactions are governed by the change process, 2 factor authentications and a
“four eyes’ process. A unique identifier is created and can be audited for this type of transaction within
HNGx, Horizon would require more extensive work to investigate as explained below.

1. Can Post Office change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change? No

WBD_000724.000003
WBONO0000854
WBON0000854

2. Can Fujitsu change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change? Once
created, branch transaction data cannot be changed, only additional data can be inserted. If this is
required, the additional transactions would be visible on the trading statements but would not require
acknowledgement / approval by a sub-postmaster, the approval is given by Post Office via the change
process. In response to a previous query Fujitsu checked last year when this was done on Horizon Online

and we found only one occurrence in March 2010 which was early in the pilot for Horizon Online and was

covered by an appropriate change request from Post Office and an auditable log. For Old Horizon, a

detailed examination of archived data would have to be undertaken to look into this across the lifetime of

use. This would be a significant and complex exercise to undertake and discussed previously with Post

Office but discounted as too costly and impractical.

3. If not, where is the evidence for this conclusion? See Answer 2

4. If so:

a)
b)

c)

d)

e)

How does this happen? See above

Why was this functionality built into the system design? To allow for data to be corrected if there
were any defects found in the system

Why would Fujitsu need to use this functionality? As above and under instructions from Post
Office Ltd.

What controls are in place to prevent the unauthorised use of this method of access? This is
achieved through a number of industry standard controls (RBAC, 2 factor authentication etc)
which are robustly audited under ISO 27001 / IAS 3402, Link, PCI.

When has branch data been accessed in this way in the past? See above

5. In relation to the Winn/Lusher email:

Regards,

a)

What is "message store"?This is the repository (or database) where all transactions were written
to in the old Horizon system

b) Can this be used to access and change branch records? /t can be used to access the records. Data
cannot be changed, but new data could be inserted into it. Any such inserted data would be
tightly controlled by operational processes explained above.

c) What is the "impact" of this change on branch records? The impact would depend on exactly
what records were inserted.

d) Would the subpostmaster be aware of this change? Yes, via the trading statement but spm’s are
not required to approve the change, this is provided by Post Office.

e) Why would this method of access be used? To correct errors if a software defect is identified.

f) What controls are in place to prevent misuse of this method of access? As above.

Subject: Strictly Private & Confidential - Subject to Privilege

James,

Could Fujitsu please answer the questions below so that we can respond to a specific challenge put to us by
Second Sight in connection with a Mediation Scheme complaint, namely that:

"the Andy Winn/Alan Lusher email in the case of Ward [...] explicitly states that Fujitsu can remotely change the
figures in the branches without the SPMs’ knowledge or authority".

WBD_000724.000005
WBONO0000854
WBON0000854

The Winn/Lusher email is attached. The part of the email in question is:
“Fujitsu have the ability to impact branch records via the message store but have extremely rigorous procedures in
place to prevent adjustments being made without prior authorisation - within POL and Fujitsu these controls form
the core of our court defence if we get to that stage.”
Questions:
6. Can Post Office change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change?
7. Can Fujitsu change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change?
8. If not, where is the evidence for this conclusion?
9. If so:
a) How does this happen?
b) Why was this functionality built into the system design?
c) Why would Fujitsu need to use this functionality?
d) What controls are in place to prevent the unauthorised use of this method of access?
e) When has branch data been accessed in this way in the past?
10. In relation to the Winn/Lusher email:
a) Whatis "message store"?
b) Can this be used to access and change branch records?
c) What is the "impact" of this change on branch records?
d) Would the subpostmaster be aware of this change?
e) Why would this method of access be used?
f) What controls are in place to prevent misuse of this method of access?

Please let me know if it would be easier to address these in a phone call in the first instance.
