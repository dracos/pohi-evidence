Legal Update —- Case Review @

Cartwright King have sift reviewed 151 cases, including 19 from
Scotland and Northern Ireland. Of those 19, 4 sift reviews are
incomplete as we have insufficient information at present.

It is anticipated that there will be further files from Scotland and the RMG
to add to the review process once they have been received.

They estimate that there should be less than 20 cases left to sift review.

Of the 151 cases which have been sift reviewed, 20 cases have had a
full review and there are 10 further cases to review.

Further disclosure has been provided to the defence in 9 cases to date.

Budget for Subpostmaster support

+ BD and JFSA have both provided their view on how much we should budget for

Subpostmaster support and expenses.
+ BD estimate £4k per case
+ JFSAestimate £2k per case

+ Neither included travel expenses in their estimates
+ As we look to move Second Sight away from the investigation more work will fall
on the advisor to prepare the case, the quality of the advisor will help/hinder this

process.

Recommendation:

+ Subpostmasters receive upper limit of £2k per case. (obviously, we will only

approve legitimate, invoiced costs).

+ Post Office budgets the higher amount (£4k) to allow us to recruit higher calibre
advisors if necessary and to cover the contingency that they take longer to
prepare than estimated, or we receive more cases that estimated, and cover

other expenses eg travel

Second Sight Proposals (2)

Objective

We have committed that Second Sight complete the review of the cases in the investigation (43). The

investigation will now cover a larger number of cases beyond this. We need to find a way to allocate

these new cases to an alternative party.

Options.

+ Keep Second Sight to December, use a alternative organisation from January onwards

+ Alternative organisation recruited now and works in parallel with Second Sight (Second Sight only
doing the original cases)

+ We adapt the independent advisor role into the role currently being performed by Second Sight
(preparing case files)

Challenges

+ Gaining support from JA, JFSA (and maybe Second Sight)

+ Expectations have been set with MPs that Second Sight will continue with the investigation to the
end. (exerts from parliamentary debate below)

Proposal

+ Start engaging with key stakeholders (including Second Sight) about engaging an additional
company to initially support them (to cope with the anticipated increased work load). The new
organisation would need to have Second Sight's approval

+ After the initial cases are completed the new organisation takes over.

will set up a working party to complete the review of cases Itis important that any The continued input of Second Sight is
started by Second Sight, and will consider all 47 cases brought —_further work is not only incredibly important, given its familiarity
forward by the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance independent, but seen to with the case so far and the fact that it
be independent, and enjoys the confidence of many of those
clearly the role of, involved,
‘Second Sight in that is

Appendix — our public commitments (2)

1. The creation of a working party to work collaboratively to complete the review of cases
started by Second Sight last year. This would examine the themes identified by Second Sight
and consider all cases brought forward by the JFSA and MPs, together with any new themes
which emerge from these cases. The JFSA have been invited to join this working party.

2. Areview chaired by an independent figure to determine how an independent safety net
might be introduced to adjudicate in disputed cases in the future. Again the JFSA and other
stakeholders will be invited to take part in this process.

3. Anew Branch User Forum to provide a way for sub-postmasters and others to raise issues
and insights around business processes, training and support, directly feeding into the
organisation's thinking at the highest level. A key task for this forum will be to review support
processes and training to ensure they meet the standards expected of the Post Office.
