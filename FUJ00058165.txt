Managing. Directors Summary

1 SUMMARY

Main activity this month has been to see Release 1c:successfully
implemented in all 205 Post Offices. This was achieved exactly on
target on the 20" November and involved some 330 counter
positions.

Alongside the Release 1c work increasing energy has been used to
create the New Release 2 plan and discuss alt details of this with the
PDA and the sponsors. The workload here has been extensive and -
there are still key issues to resolve in order to achieve satisfactory
sign-off by the end of December.

The PA independent review has taken considerable amount of
energy. The first section dealing with the tactical issues has
progressed reasonably well but the longer term handling of the
strategic issues has required considerable time and effort and in the
critical area of business case has not yet found the right answer.

With the appointment of the new Post Office Client Director we
are beginning to make broader contacts across the Post Office
Group and connect strands of activities which can benefit ICL at
large as well as strengthen the case within ICL Pathway.

On the International front, the team was concentrated almost
exclusively on the Deutsche Post bid and the follow up actions.
The current indication is that the proposal has been well received
technically and it is possible that we will make the shortlist by the
end of December notwithstanding the fact that we are substantially
non-compliant in a number of areas, particularly on timescales.

2.2 PROGRESS - GENERAL

The successful go-live on Release 1c has been a major success for
the whole of ICL Pathway and the.servicé has run with relatively
few teething problems since it went live. None of these have been
serious but they all require careful attention. This will be even
more'importantias the card payment population increases over the
next few months. Considering the technical complexities of this
release, this is an outstanding success, although has been received
fairly quietly by the PDA and their Sponsors.

On New Release 2 we have provided the comprehensive
documentation set for the baseline of this release and have spent
extensive amounts of time presenting, following up, describing and
clarifying all the details for this plan with PDA and the Sponsors
jointly and separately. Nevertheless, there are some critical content
items which must be resolved before the plan can be put to bed by
the end of this year and we are approaching an agreement to
disagree on the roll-out timescales for this release. All parties now
are comfortable to accept October 1998 for the software
deliverable to be ready for live trial but the Sponsors themselves
want to defer live trial until January 1999 with an attendant three
month delay on national roll-out. We have written to them
describing what our terms are for us to comply with their dates.
This has the hall marks still of a major dispute. Notwithstanding
the above, we did formally start the system test New Release 2 on
target on the 8" December.

The PA independent review was followed through with final Chief
Executive’s Workshop on the 8" December where the-outstanding
strategic risks were discussed, debated and action plans agreed.
Areas of progress concern the agreement to implement a lower
technology solution for 3,000 of the smallest Post Offices. This
will take risk out of the progranime, remove some important areas
of cost‘from ICL Pathway and will allow us to resolve the non-
ISDN issues without resource to satellite technology. We also made
progress in agreeing the new managemént arrangements to drive
the programme forward in which the prospect of PDA disappearing
is achievable between Spring and Summer 1998. This will lead to
an arrangement whereby discussions are conducted on a bi-lateral
nature,.for example between Pathway and POCL, rather than
today’s three way or often four way debates where gridlock
prevents anything happening. Potential progress here is‘good but it
does all depend on POCL rising to the challenge of taking a grip on
their resourcing, becoming much more pro-active and
demonstrating that they have drive and capability of making
difficult decisions. This will not be easy.

Managing Directors Summary Date: 16/12/97

. In this review, PA concluded that-they were comfortable with the
steps ICL Pathway was taking to manage our dependencies on
Escher Group. However it is clear‘that the Sponsors don’t like this
assessment and will continue to press on their own initiative to
continue to chase this issue. The major area of disappointment and
progress was resolving how to produce a robust business case for all
three parties. This requires quite a lot more work and will be
escalated to Ministers early in the New Year to see which is the key
direction all parties want to pursue. Whilst these discussions
continue, it is vital that ICL Pathway makes.solid progress on the
ground and continues to achieve against targets which is now more
visible for all to see.

e On the wider Post Office Group side we are making contacts in
Royal Mail, HQ level and SSL and are finding ways to create a
stronger vision for a Post Office initiative around the Government -
Services and Government.direct and to press for a better higher
ground positioning. The response to this has generally been good
and the opportunities during 1998 for exploitation look interesting
and achievable.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

e The most important area now is to develop, discuss, agree and
implement a new business plan for the programme and to win the ]
argument that‘an extension of the contract is essential to see this
programme gain the true returns it deserves. POCL are very much
in tune'with this but there is a lot to do to bring BA into the same fi
thinking.

° It is vital we achieve a satisfactory resolution to the New Release 2
contents and plan and this will require a lot of work still during
December.

e To change the management arrangement to be more workable and
with a faster cycle time on decisions will require substantial change
of attitude and style within Post Office Counters and a new
approach to management. Of particular significance is how they
respond to the-appointment of a Horizon Programme Director at
Board level reporting to the Managing Director. A test case here is
to whether they recruit internally or buy the best in the market:
.The danger is that this will take too long.

4 ISSUES

e The arrangements for acceptance for New Release 2 are going to be
difficult and time absorbing’and much work still remains to be
done.

. There are critical outstanding commercial issues to resolve around
the.implementation side of the programme, particularly around the
difficulties within the Post Office estate on the poor physical
condition of the vast majority of the Post Offices. The appetite to
confront this head on within POCL has’yet to be seen.

° We need to find a progressive way of advancing new products with
POCL whilst at the same time seeing through the main thrustof the
programme which is still 100% BA directed. The key opportunity
here is to conclude the deal around the Bill Payment initiative, get
this implemented during the first halfof 1998 and use this as a
parallel stream of devélopment to test: market new POCL products

. without being paced and slowed down by the torturous and time
consuming tasks on the benefit payment systems. POCL can see the
merits of doing this but again lack the decision and clout to make it
happen. ,

Customer Requirements Report

1 SUMMARY

° Release 1C has demanded considerable support work. CCN 117, which
introduces on-line working, has been returned rewritten after eight
months. SADD 4.1 was output. Pathway-Lite definitions for benefits were
produced. POCL is planning to defer some contracted and hot-items until
after Release 3.

2 PROGRESS

2.1.1 RELEASE 1

° Live support for Release 1C has included: resolving correct post office
addresses; problems arising from failure in XPERT (the EDS product at
the CAPS/CAS boundary); duplicate encashment problems; ISDN line
outages; reporting encashments back to CAPS; reconciliation reports; and
liaison with ITSA and EDS on Reference Data. In addition a number of
PinICLs have been cleared, and live running problems resolved. Two
urgent CPs have been raised to-rectify issues in Release 1C.

e Tony H output BPS Reference Data at Pathway Release 1C.

2.1.2 RELEASE 1 / NEW 2

e The CAPS baseline document sets for use at Release 1C and New Release 2
were formally agreed with the PDA together with the file layout versions
to be used for every file at all stages in the migration from 1C to New 2.
This matches the definitions in Interface Version Control in which CAPS
accepts responsibility for the “glueware” which maintains compatibility of
interface files during-this migration.

° The Temporary Tokens usage document was completely, updated, issued
and re-issued incorporating comments. Final proofs of the tokens have
been received from De La Rue.

e The PDA has returned CCN 117, rewritten eight months after the original
was provided to them. A note summarising-issues with the rewrite was

produced. There is no alternative but to go through the whole CCN117
documentation again.

° We have reviewed the End-to-End processes for change of nominated post
office produced by consultants for the sponsors. Whilst there are some
useful points covered, they dodge the issues of nominated post office
operation during benefit roll-out’ when a mix of electronic and paper
payments exists.

ICL Pathway Pathway Programme Monthly Report V Ref: PAREPIOOIS
ersion: 1,
Customer Requirements Report Date: 16/12/97

The Counter Hardware Design Specification was revised. A new baseline
will be produced this month.

2.1.3 RELEASE NEW 2/3

Version 4.1 of the SADD was produced and output. This factored in all
che required PDA and sponsor comments which arrived too late for 4.0,
and all Release Contents Definition exclusions/inclusions which affect the
steady state definition. There is a PA Consulting action list: commitment.
to produce Version 5.0 at the turn of the year.

A paper, Community Offices - New Paradigms, was produced: this
investigated what requirements could/should be supported for a Pathway-
Lite product definition to handle the bottom 3000+ offices in an
economic fashion. The low end workload data and costing were. brought
up to date and competitive material on personal digital assistants
assembled. All aspects of BPS functionality were dealt with and the paper
is now on hold pending policy decisions.

CPs were produced for all known required changes to PAS/CMS at New
Release 2, together with CCNs for Restricted Post Office infringements
and Pathway Initiated CMS End of Interest.

BES processing to maximise an encashment to approach £1,000 has had to
be suppressed as PAG, the DSS accounting section, cannot handle the gaps
in’ payment sequences.

A list of all possible statuses and events for card batches, cards and
Temporary Tokens was produced. There are particular difficulties in
handling the interactions of closures and changes of nominated post office
during rollout. The Workload Compendium from the PDA issued this
month estimated that the rate of changes of nominated office will be three
to four times higher than previously advised.

Further information on low end volumes was passed to design in support
of the selection of alternative communications.access methods to ISDN.

2.1.4 CARS

The PDA have yet again changed their répresentation. The paperwork was
brought up to date.

The principal task for December is to mark up those as yet undelivered
CARs which are the-more urgent for New Release 2.

The switch from old to New Release 2 has logically undone a number of
CARs in the AP area. New Release 2 will not support.direct-to-Client
transfer of AP data (except possibly for new Clients). A number of

important CARs were signed off in July on the basis that old Release 2
would do this.

2.1.5 ACCEPTANCE

Four High Level Test Scripts for R2 were reviewed. In general the quality
is good. Two more remain to be completed. A large amount of
Acceptance Test material remains to be reworked.

DCH is producing a BES counter transaction structure against which the
BES acceptance criteria can be placed. If this can be completed and agreed
with PDA it should greatly simplify the relationship between tests and
acceptance criteria.

2.1.6 NEW BUSINESS SUPPORT

Logistics Feeder Service (LFS): This-is now issued at Version 13. It
incorporates answers to all our Drafting Notes. A meeting with the LFS
team to discuss how we will use Reference Data and what New R2 EPOSS
does is planned for this month

National Savings (NS): . No activity’- waiting for a Release 3 timetable and
scheduled by POCL as post Release 3. 7

EFTPOS - POCL have yet to confirm functionality. POCL have scheduled
this as post Release 3.

Sundries: Papers were produced for a Housing Benefit Service, Household
Budgeting Service, and Social Banking.

Dave C attended an iFORMS event at Microsoft. There will be a follow
up event this month at Pathway. .

Dave C.also:attended the ICL Smart Card Interest Group to ensure

Pathway correctly positioned within. new ICL/FJ/Amdahl SmartCity
VISION group.

Dave H attended several POCL meetings, as part of the PA Consulting
actions, to identify the extension required to Pathway’s Data warehouse to
handle TIP (routine POCL accounting).

Dave H Amber Teamed the response to the POCL ITT for call centre
management.

2.2 OTHER TEAM ACTIVITIES

2.2.1 INTERNATIONAL SALES BIDS

The Requirements team contribution to the German Post Office bid was
completed and planning activities started to establish a demonstration and
proving capability following short listing. Brian H continues to be
dedicated to German Post Office.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

° None

4 ISSUES

e The Change Control process has become hopelessly protracted and
uncertain: CCN117 was returned rewritten after eight:months, and the
rewrite does not represent improvement or progress, mostly tinkering with
commercial terms to squeeze us'for a few more nickels and dimes.

e¢ The POCL mindset on Release 3 contents is particularly disappointing and
internally focused. It does not include EFTPOS, DNS, or Banking services.

© The dropping of Client interfaces for AP at New Release 2 could be used
as a stopper for Acceptance.

Customer Service Report

1 MONTHLY SUMMARY

November saw the successful implementation of Release 1C, a major
milestone for ICL Pathway. The migration from Release 1A (IGL) and
from Release 1B (OBCS) went remarkably smoothly as did the
implementation of the latest version of CAPS (Congo 4.1).

Release 1C is now fully operational in more than 200 offices and we are
already seeing payment cards being processed through the system for new
customers receiving Child Benefit.

Our hardware and network infrastructure and support service processes
are now being challenged more rigorously and, in general, the release is
proving to be.robust with few problems.

In November there were 32 visits by ICL Sorbus engineers and for the first
time we received 100% return of the Service Visit Reply Card. More than
93% of replies were positive.

2 PROGRESS

2.1 OPERATIONS

Very successful migration exercise from Release 1A and 1B to 1C.

The CAPS upgrade (Congo 4.1) exhibited:more problems mainly on the
CAPS activities.

A Duty Manager roster is being introduced which will improve our
management and response to operational problems around the clock.

The RED Alert on Tivoli is.now in ‘monitor’ stage. We have a fix from
Tivoli which is on Phase 3 test and which will form the basis of a general
release from Tivoli after a period. of verification testing in their test
environment. The PDA has agreed an extension to the current
workaround arrangements for Release 1C.

2.2 RELEASE MANAGEMENT

Since the start of MOT, we have raised 65 release notes and applied 67
software fixes to the live system. There are a further 54 PinICLs in work-
in-progress.

The-main problem area is with.the Data Warehouse and associated MIS
applications which had not completed testing during MOT.

2.3 BUSINESS SUPPORT

© — A report detailing all BPS exceptions is now being published weekly.

eA secure area within the IGL computer room.has been established to
provide the Business. Support Unit with access to the live system.

oe There have been 11 cases encountered where duplicate transactions could
have been made. In all but 3 cases this was avoided and the root cause of
each case is now well understood. Avoidance actions are in progress.

2.4 CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
© 16 visits in the. Management Care Visit programme have now been
conducted. Feedback remains encouraging.

e The percentage of returned service visit reply cards rose:to100% with the
percentage of.satisfied responses steady at 93.5%.

e¢ The results of a telephone survey of the IGL sites that moved to 1C
revealed some positive comments and some concerns. The issues raised by
the survey are being progressed.

2.5 SYSTEM SUPPORT
e — Diagnostic skills:and overall knowledge of the systems continues to
improve.

e The move to BRAO1 is delayed by lack of communications link installation
and increased requirement for security fail-safe access control system.

2.6 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SERVICES

. Disappointingly inconsistent results output from the Data Warehouse
development at Release 1C. This has been escalated but little can be done
in time:for the fiext Service Management Review meeting.

Quality & Risk Report

1 MONTHLY SUMMARY

ERM progress. Initial attempts to produce FRM reports have been
frustrated by inadequate build of the FRM pc’s:at Bootle and delays in
loading of the data warehouse. EVP issues continue to be raised - the latest
is thar it is possible for EVP to be asked more than once per customer
session.

Risk Management. Several.tisk reviews have been conducted, including
resilience and recovery, Help Desk. Authentication, Pathway. ‘Light’
solution.

System Security. The status of.the CRA on Tivoli event harvesting has been
reduced; a solution.is being tested. Discussions continue with PDA
regarding security exclusions for NR2. Issues are still the provision of
digital signing for AP and Authentication of Help Desks to Post Offices.in
fallback.

Quality. Ric implementation has involved a large number of failures of
hardware. Analysis is in hand and will be reviewed with subcontractors in
December.

Audit. The first Mid Stage Quality Audit has been conducted (of Design

for NR2). An internal QMS audit of the PIT process and a DQA were also
held. Definition and refinement of audit requirements with BA and POCL
continues, with a good working relationship developing. The major issue is
confidentiality of information between the two parties. Internally; [have a

concern that the Audit design is late, which may impact implementation
for NR2.

Year 2000 Conformance. Reviews of all suppliers continues, including
product and service suppliers and is being monitored via a risk register.
POCL are still insisting that they. require Pathway to be compliant'by the
end of 1998, which is not a contractual requirement. Joint Liaison
meetings with PDA, POCL and DSS are revealing-activities which may
impact Pathway.

2.1 FRAUD RISK MANAGEMENT

2.1.1 RELEASE 1¢

e — The Business Objects FRM PCs located at Bootle have beén patched to
produce reports. They still need rebuilding to the full CM build script. -
Attempts to’produce the November.reports have initially failed due to the
data warehouse being a number of days behind in loading encashment
details. This has now been rectified but does raise-concern over the ability
to produce the FRM trend reports to agreed timescales.

e The Internal Investigation Procedure is now complete. The Investigation
of Reconciliation Fraud Procedure will involve Security,.FRM and
Reconciliation teams and processes are being defined.

2.1.2 RELEASE 2

e PDA have requested a change’ to.subdivide FRM reports by BA/DSS
regions. A solution has been put forward as a CCN with full costings. All
other reports have now been agreed and are being developed. An internal
change’request has been raised to,enhance the EVP reporting. as in the
RCD.

° PDA.agreed to prodtice a proposal for the Fraud Incentive Reward Scheme
by April 1997. A three page letter has been received from Stuart Riley.
This does not.provide any detail of how the scheme would operate and
implies no responsibility for the running of it. There is still a considerable
amount of work to be carried out before any scheme can be implemented.

e A significant problem has been identified in that EVP can be asked more
than once per.customer session in certain circumstances. A logical
argument can be put forward; that it is caused by the partitioning of the
services, but it is likely to cause grave concern within the PDA and
Sponsors. A position paper is being prepared for the PDA.

e Further revisions of the liability and reconciliation matrices are underway.

2.2 RISK MANAGEMENT

¢ The Fujitsu report due to be issued on 28 November has been rescheduled
for the end of December 97 due to the moving baseline of the NR2 plan.

e  Arisk review of the resilience and recovery strategy for NR2 has started
with weekly meetings being held to ensure that all areas requiring recovery
procedures are identified.

Quality & Risk Report Date: 16/12/97

. A risk assessment of the Help Desk Authentication (to Post Offices in
fallback) is underway, although the volumetrics for NR2 are currently
unreliable.

e An initial fraud risk assessment of the Pathway ‘Light’ solution has been
carried out.

e An analysis has been carried out of the potential for providing additional
services associated with the use of Pathway data for targeting claims fraud.

2.3 SYSTEM SECURITY

e. Version 2.4 of the SFS and 1.3-of the ACP are with the PDA for sign off,
after detailed internal review.

2.3.1 RELEASE 1¢

° Key material for the protection of links to SSC (Bracknell) and Oracle and
Sequent have been received from CESG.

° Activity continues regarding the Customer Red Alert for Tivoli event
harvesting. The initial 4 week work around has been extended. A solution
to the core problem is being tested. The CRA has been reclassified to
‘Monitor’ status.

e There. has been an outbreak of viruses.in C2 (Feltham), associated with a
floppy disk on a hot desk pe. It has been contained and reported.

2.3.2 RELEASE 2

¢ Discussion s continue with the PDA regarding the security exclusions for
NR2. The exclusion of AP Signing is causing ‘considerable
disappointmen?’ although we.are’strongly maintaining the position that it
is not required contractually at NR2.

° Continuing effort goes into attempting to define and agree a solution to
authentication of Help Desks in fallback (for R1¢ as well as NR2). This is
likely to be a significant issue for acceptance of the security solution.

e — Specification of requirements for a secure Sequent platform and SecurID
tokens is underway.

e The TSC design for Key Management has been reviewed.

2.4 QUALITY

. Requirements of ISO 9001 and Pathway Quality Policies have been
reviewed the Implementation team.

. The Security Vetting Questionnaire has been updated at the request of
HR, to reflect current responsibilities and operation of the process
reviewed.

e Initial feedback from R1c implementation shows a.large number of
hardware failures. Analysis of “failed” units is in hand at the Verification
Centresto provide a basis for reviews with the sub-contractors, and will be
reported in December.

¢ — The ICL Policy Framework has been reviewed with the conclusion that
detailed activity is not be appropriate for Pathway this year: Estelle Clark
has confirmed that this approach is acceptable.

2.5 PROCESS MANAGEMENT

e On-Line Standards have been upgraded to Version 11.

° End-2-End New Business Processes continue. The two documents, NSI
process and BRD PD have been updated with those comments deemed to
be material. The documents have been returned to PDA for another review
cycle. (This activity has.now achieved its first-anniversary!)

2.6 AUDIT

e The first Mid Stage Quality Audit (of NR2 Design) has been conducted,
indicating only partial.take up of standards ad processes-and little
evidence of activities and individuals. Recommendations have been made
for improvement.

. Internal QMS Audits The PIT process has been reviewed with PIT
manager to clarify our approach to Process Audits.

° A Delivered Quality Audit has been carried out in NE region during R1b
to Ric migration. 2 offices were attended during equipment installation;
and 3 others visited during the same day as installation to obtain feedback.

¢ — Work continues to identify the requirements for Release 2. Workshops
with the PDA and sponsors have been conducted and have identified
requirements for bulk and investigative audit. .

2.7 YEAR 2000 CONFORMANCE

° Investigation and monitoring of the product suppliers plans’ for
compliance continues. Issues have been identified with BMC Patrol,
Sequent, NDL. The ownership of products needs clarification.

° Service Providers. Initial contact has been made with DLRCT, Thomas De
La Rue and GiroBank and we now have their agreement to provide the
compliance information. The initial assessment is low risk.

° Service Providers (Roll out). Compliance statement has been received from
WTL.

Quality & Risk Report Date: 16/12/97

° A Risk Register has been established to provide a monitor of progress
towards supplier compliance.

¢ — The Stage Management Plan is.now ready for sign off at the next meeting
of the PathwayY2K Steering Committee.

° Paul Rich (POCL) is still of the view that compliance in 1998 will only be
achieved by Pathway if it becomes an acceptance item. This is using-a
slédge hammer to crack a nut: the way ahead is to involve POCL people
with Y2K awareness in the testing programme, so that POCL can assess
our. status.

° An.awareness session has been.held with development; further sessions
with design and TSC are scheduled.

° Joint Liaison Meetings with PDA, POCL and DSS. are beginning to
become more fruitful, at least in revealing the previously undeclared
activities going on with DSS/POCL systems and which must impact on
Pathway. That this information was not made visible by the PDA is a
concern. This. meeting however needs to move up from the low level
tactical position to take a more strategic view of the business impacts.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS :

4 ISSUES

e The audit design, and by association Security Event Management, for NR2

is late. This is causing concern about the extent of the implementation for
NR2.

° Risk Management is still suffering from a surfeit of ad-hoc queries which is
impacting core activities.

° Acceptance of NR2 security exclusions in particular AP Signing and
definition of an acceptable solution to the authentication of Help Desks in
fallback continue to be issues.

° PDA are still claiming that providing support from Belfast requires a
Change Request. Our concern is that this will set a precedent and all sites
will. require such, and is therefore being forcibly rebutted.

° Paul Rich (POCL) is still of the view that compliance in 1998 will only be
achieved by Pathway if it becomes an acceptance item.

al

° The effectiveness of the Change Management Process is an issue in
particular the quality of Change Proposals and involvement of key people
in the process.

Business Development Report

1 SUMMARY.

© — The Bill Payment initiative is continuing to grind along. We are inundated
with technical people. It is very difficult to spot the decision maker. I
realistically do not expect any decision until well into January.

° The uncertainty about dates is still continuing to hurt. It is very difficult to
goto POCL’s clients and discuss requirements with no expectation of an
implementation date. However I] am hopeful that the latest round of
discussions will give something concrete to aim at.

° There remains a serious issue regarding’ recovery of the business case.
Simply-re-engineering transactions will not achieve the business we need,
hence the need to focus in some key areas that will drive significant
volume, e.g. genéric banking and bill payment.

° I remain unconvinced about POCL’s ability to drive through some of the
business:change necessary with their clients. Increasingly I sec us being
drawn into direct discussions with the clients. There is a very tight line
here and we need to exercise care but it is a vital line to take in the
protection of our business.

° We. have, I believe, now-convinced: POCL that Social Banking is a potential
major plank on which new government will be driven. BA will certainly go
down this'track. Our challenge is to ensure that we help them get there.
The SEP on 15/16 Dec will help test POCL’s resolve to do this.

e Government.direct is continuing-and gathering momentum as the white
paper nears. Post Office Genesis.direct is not making progress. I have now
had feedback from three members of the ‘consortium’, all of whom are
disappointed with the lack of progress. The real problem is that no-one is
driving it. There is an opportunity for ICL to step in (carefully).

¢ = Customer Education will shortly move back to BA CAPS from the.PDA.
This is a good move and will enable direct contact with the main sponsor
rather than trying to-operate at arms-length through the PDA.

° Implementation issues continue to run on. The main activity revolves
around Migration and Training each of which has possible commercial
impact.

2 PROGRESS
2.1 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
. The Billpay initiative continues to make slow progress. We are being

inundated with requests for technical documents all in pursuit of assurance
that the system is fit for purpose. Programme plans.have been.submitted.
We have undertaken a.detailed risk assessment. The teclinical people have
seen a demonstration of the system. The PDA arc involved but not in a
negative way.

e What is really needed is a big push from the business (POCL) to just.get on
and do it. I am discussing the business case with. Paul Harris. I believe the
APT option is now too hard. We must keep the pressure oni, otherwise this
will not happen. If we get this project to fly, then that presents a parallel
stream on which to build without'the BA stranglehold which otherwise
will cause POCL product to slip-well out.

. Generic banking discussions have taken place with our international
colleagues. The requirement for a-generic product is vary similar. Given
that the German need ‘is to implement something on the banking side
sooner than UK, Brian Hauxwell is taking the lead on this and is bringing
some of his former work into play. I see this as covering the longer term
requirements of National Savings, A&L/Girobank and such as Lloyds/TSB
and the Co-op Bank.

© — Other BRDs are still viewed as work in progress, However due to date
slippage, the current position is:

LFS: viewed as the most urgent by POCL.and needed
for Release 3.

EFTPOS: not yet fully defined but they will now run a
stand alone pilot for evaluation. That will not be
complete until August ’98 therefore it is unlikely to get a
signed off BRD until after that date.

National Savings: The BRD originally expressed
requirements aiming at an April ’98-date. Given the
latest dates, it is highly likely that NS will.wish to review
those requirements in the light of other changes to their
business.

Alliance & Leicester: want to see their requirements
fulfilled in Release 3 but are waiting on dates before
confirming any detailed requirements.

2.2 CUSTOMER EDUCATION

The Customer Education strategy plan is still being reviewed by the
programme. We have not been a given a date for response. The move to
CAPS of customer education will help.

A Special Interest Group (SIG) event will now take place in the South
West region on 15" December and one in the North East in early 98. This
is contrary to the original steer given by the PDA and seemingly was
driven by ministerial request/demand.

All collateral has been produced and is available through the fulfilment
line. We are currently testing the effectiveness of the fulfilment line
through internal demand processes.

There have been a number of rumblings in the press arena, one article in
Computing, incorrect and harmless. There has also been a leak to the
Guardian which is being tackled at the moment. The basic approach with
press activity is to keep heads down.

2.3 CUSTOMER RELATIONS

The role of the Pathway Liaison Manager (Jacqui & Greg) continues to be
of significant benefit. They are acting as ‘eyes and ears’ in the regions but
importantly have also developed a very good relationship with the
subpostmasters. They are filling a serious:gap in ensuring that the users are
happy with the system and able to use it correctly. This role is not
accepted by POCL as they operate at arms length and this type of effort is
handled either by Help Desks or bythe Retail Network Manager who also
has potentially 50 other offices to look after and a myriad of other tasks.

Several meetings have taken place with the Federation of Subpostmasters
and with the individual Regional General Managers to ensure that they are
up to date with the programme as otherwise channels of communication
are at best slow and potentially inaccurate.

Martin Johnston is continuing the major task of sorting out the
Agreements.to Agree. This has remained a full time task.

1 SUMMARY

1.1 DEUTSCHE POST AG

e — We have been selected by Deutsche Post as one of the shortlisted suppliers
to enter into the ‘demonstration phase’. This will commence on January
5 98. The tests will be carried out at Deutsche Post’s IT Headquarters in
Damstadt. This demonstration phase will continue until 13"" March 98,
there:will then be a 6 week period for decision making with final contract
award at the end of April 98.

1.2 HUNGARY POST

e We were also shortlisted by Hungary Post. The next phase of their
procurement is a demonstration of the proposed.systems in-_Budapest. We
were due to commence this work last Monday 8" Dec 97. However it was
postponed due to a yellow flag.being waved by Digital and Samsung,
neither of which could pass the base set of mandatory requirements set out
in the ‘capabilities’ documentation. We are told the demonstrations will
now take place in January 98.

1.3 DENMARK POST

° Meetings were held this month to discuss a way forward with Danish Post.
They have selected Riposte as their’base. platform and are setting up a two
Post Office Pilot which.is intended to go live next month. Their next phase
is to issue an ITT during April 98 for the outsourcing of the major
implementation phase and it is here they have been seeking our assistance.
The outsourcing contract will be awarded in Jul/Aug 98.

1.4 SWEDISH POST

e We were invited to present our capabilities to Swedish Post this month.
They are in early stages of defining their Architecture for the future so the
meeting was very timely. Following this we are intending to hold a two
day workshop in order to demonstrate the technologies that-are available
today and discuss how they can be applied to the business.

1.5 JAPAN

e Earlier this month I held a video conference with our colleagues in Tokyo.
There have been some fundamental changes in the government structure
and a statement that the Post will be privatised. This opens an opportunity
for us to engage:in conversation with MPT. In order. to bring our Fujitsu
colleagues up to speed I have given them a ‘discussion paper’ that I wrote
for MPT when I was with IBM earlier this year.

1.6 THE COUNTER AUTOMATION TOOLSET (CAT)

° During our bid for DPAG it became necessary to develop some
differentiators from SNI who are also bidding a Riposte solution. As such
we looked at all of the skills, developments and IPR that .have been gained
within Pathway over the past 2 to 3 years and kence the CAT evolved.
CAT represents a range of product and services that are essential to any
large scale counter implementation. This range of services is now being
‘productised’, if you. require further information please contact me.

2 PROGRESS

e There are no handshake-milestones affected by international sales.

1 MONTHLY SUMMARY

The principal activity this month has been progressing the PA Audit
follow-up work under the heading “reinforcing the business case”, in
preparation for the.second MDs workshop 8 Dec.

Progress has also been made in developing new bid opportunities for call
centres and desktop supply and services.

2 PROGRESS

2.1 PATHWAY

Following the first MDs workshop, the BA/POCL/ICL Pathway group
researching the opportunities to reinforce the various parties’ business
cases produced papers on Claimant Fraud, Household Budgetting,
Housing Benefit, Stakeholder Pensions and Government Services. The
scoping, by both BA and POCL, of the real business opportunity was in
each case. limited.

Following discussions with Basil Shall, we are re-opening the dialogue with
Post Office Group on genesis.direct, their version of a government.direct
pilot. Shall and Ian Gair the genesis.direct PM are visiting Feltham on Dec
11°. We are also reviewing the Microsoft work on iFORMS on Dec 9".

2.2 OTHER ACTIVITIES

The outsourcing /JV of the IBM Huthwaite data centre has, as expected,
gone.to Bull.

The One Stop Shop Desktop bid, which false-started earlier this year, has
now been re-advertised in the European Journal. This opportunity has
been tracked by Mark Newall, Tplc account manager for The Post Office,
who is leading the response. The content of the ITT is expected to
commence with supply of desktop. PCs, extending to a range of services
including technology refresh, desktop service, break-fix maintenance,
education and training.

° The Customer Contact Centres ITT turns out to be closer to an.RFI,
leading to uncertainty whether they have already selected preferred
partners. We have put together a bid team based around Call Centre
technical and bid skills in ICL Ireland and in Kainos, together with
specialist telephony hardware from Lucent technologies and specialist
software from IBM Gallpath and Graham Technologies. We are
positioning ICL as the systems integrator and prime contractor, based on.a
track record of building similar systems for Telecom Eireann, Lombard &
Ulster division of NatWest and ScottishPower.

¢ — Anew Journal ad has appeared for supply of architecture and tools for
Desktop service management. CFM have.appointed a.salesman to
progress this one.
