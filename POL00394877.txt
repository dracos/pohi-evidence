1. Introduction

ABSTRACT; Contains a definition of what “architecture” means in relation to IT systems.
Lists the sources of requirements and provides a high-level introduction to the document.

1.1 Definition

This document describes the security framework proposed for HNG-X. It does not have detailed technical
information but covers the principles, process and standards that should be used during the project.

This document uses the Open Group description of an architecture which is:

“The structure of components, their interrelationships, and the principles and
guidelines governing their design and evolution over time.”

The first draft of this document concentrates on the “principles and guidelines governing their design and
evolution over time.”

Security, when correctly implemented, is not a block on business activity and progress, on the contrary it
must be in place as a business enabler to allow change to take place as quickly as the business requires,
but in a secure and controlled fashion.

It is very important therefore that a set of guiding principles are agreed and established, and embedded
into the planning, change management and operational processes of HNG-X. These principles will
ensure that the appropriate level of risk management is performed and the controls that are then put in
place will be secure, cost-effective, appropriate to the requirements and will allow business change to
take place quickly and securely thereby ensuring the greatest possible cost benefits,

1.2 Requirements Sources.
The security architecture document has been developed from the following sources;
1) Post Office requirements
a) Source document: [HNG-X Security Requirements Vsn 0.2]
2) Compliance requirements.
a) Legislation

i) Computer Misuse Act, Data Protection Act, Freedom of Information Act, Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act.

b) Regulation

4 Principles

ABSTRACT; Lists and describes the principles guiding the secure development,
implementation, operation and change of the HNG-X system.

These principles apply to the design, development, test, implementation and operation of all components
of the HNG-X system. The extent to which they are applied is subject to a risk analysis to assess the
threats and vulnerabilities present in the system. The controls used to mitigate the identified risks are
then selected as appropriate.

The controls to be used could be devices such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems. They could be
policies, standards and/or guidelines. They could also be coding and testing guidelines/standards.

# ~~ Principle and Explanation

1 Arisk based approach is used to development, design, operations and changes.

When a solution is being planned and designed, the Risk Management Policy and guidelines must
be used to establish the potential threats, vulnerabilities and risks applicable to the solution.

Threat scenarios should be created to further develop and explore possible vulnerabilities in the
system or design.

Security controls are only as strong as the weakest link, therefore the risk assessment focuses
priority and resources on the risks with the largest impact and identifies the weak links in the chain.
The risk assessment method chosen will differentiate between two types of attacks;

1) ‘Theoretical’ attacks, those that need an expert knowledge in lab conditions to modify an
entity protected by a security control, even if this serves no practical purpose.

2) ‘Real world’ attacks, those that are likely to be used for malicious purposes such as service
disruption, information gathering or fraud.

This is to ensure that the risk assessment is conducted efficiently and considers threats and
vulnerabilities that are likely to have the biggest impact.

2 Control access to, from and within the HNG-X infrastructure.
Access to the HNG-X infrastructure from external entities must be controlled following the guidance
in the Access Control Policy and using a combination of network, platform and application access
controls.

Access within the HNG-X system must be controlled using a combination of network, platform and
application access controls following the guidance in the Access Control Policy.

Security domains are defined within HNG-X that describe groups of security entities with similar
security requirements. Access between domains must be controlled.

3 Ensure anomalous activity is detected and responded to.

Incidents and events must be detected and managed to ensure that HNG-X is available and
operating in line with agreed SLAs.

The impact of an incident is greatly reduced through rapid and effective incident response. This
requires that incidents are contained and detected quickly.

o [TITLE  MERGEFORMAT ] "4
FUJITSU [SUBJECT \* MERGEFORMAT ] &>

# ~~ Principle and Explanation
4 Ensure systems are maintained to reduce vulnerability.

Systems must be configured correctly, patched and updated following the guidance in the Incident
Management Policy to ensure that HNG-X is available and operating in line with agreed SLAs.

Standard policies, operating procedures and standards will be written for HNG-X to provide
guidance on reducing and managing vulnerability through risk assessment, secure builds, patching
and malicious code management. These policies, operating procedures and standards with contain
appropriate validation methods, linked to change management, to ensure consistency of
deployment.

5 Ensure compliance with all relevant legislation, regulation and standards.

All relevant legislation, regulation and standards must be identified and their requirements
established in accordance with the guidance in the HNG-X Compliance Policy.

6 Ensure traceability to a business requirement.

All security controls must be traceable back to a specific business requirement.

7 Consider the “big picture” when developing solutions.

Can the solution be used elsewhere or for other purposes. Do not deploy “point solutions” without
considering what else is already available or where else the proposed solution could be used.

8 Least Privilege

Restrict access using the principle of “that which is not explicitly granted is denied” or a “default
deny” stance by granting only the permissions necessary to carry out the action being performed.
These permissions could be application, platform, network or management, (through policy), or any
combination necessary to perform the action.

This approach assumes that subject to risk assessment and given the limitations of an operating
system or other software, any entity such as a user, an application, a device or an object within
application code has no permissions to perform any action before permissions are granted. This
assumes that the default configuration of all systems is to deny access. It is very important to
ensure that the permissions matrix is developed correctly to ensure that all entities have the access
they need to perform their function.

Traffic passing between security domains must be controlled to only allow the relevant protocol and
port necessary for the service being accessed.

9 Defence in Depth

Use a layered approach to security to provide multiple controls for prevention and detection. These
controls will include application, platform, network and management controls. Controls and their
relevance will be established by risk assessment, the results of which must be documented.

10 Data Validation

Subject to risk assessment, data should be validated in all locations where processing of, or access
to, the data occurs. For example; it may be necessary to validate input at the counter and then
validate again by the application middleware. This will ensure that SQL injection, application buffer

# ~~ Principle and Explanation
overflow or similar attacks will be unsuccessful.

11 Secure Defaults

All default settings, particularly passwords and SNMP communities must be changed in line with
the HNG-X Security Policy guidance on passwords, before the system is deployed into live.

12 No Security by Obscurity
Information hiding, as a sole or primary security control, is not an acceptable method of
implementing security. For clarity, this does not refer to the use of properly designed and
configured encryption and decryption technologies.
There will be no need for a security mechanism to be hidden so that it is effective. i.e. In the case of
cryptography, the algorithms used can be well known as it is the key, when used with the algorithm,
that provides the security.

13 Check at the Gate
Check access as early as possible. Detect and prevent unauthorised access as early as possible.

14 Fail Secure
System failure should not allow the system to be compromised. Within the limits of the technology
and availability requirements, any component of the system that fails due to error or malicious
activity should fail secure. This failure event must be detected as early as possible so that suitable
containment and remediation activities can be carried out.

15 Harden Systems and Applications
All systems and infrastructure must be ‘hardened’ to an appropriate level. This is a process of
setting file, program and access permissions appropriately, removing unnecessary services and
software, applying up to date patches and configuring additional software where the risks to the
target warrant it. (Such as installing anti-malware software).

16 Don’t Reveal Excess Information
Handle errors gracefully. Don't reveal information unnecessarily. Standard web, application and
database server error messages should be modified or replaced where necessary so as to avoid
the leakage of potentially damaging information.

17 Simple is Good

The simpler a design is, the easier it is to maintain, secure and operate. This is following the
principle of “as simple as it needs to be, but no simpler”!

18 Don’t Trust Services

Assume external services are insecure. Conduct and document a risk assessment on any external
services. Validate input from external services. Control access from external services.

19 Don’t Trust Infrastructure.

Assume extemal infrastructure is insecure. Conduct and document a risk assessment on any

5 Architecture Description and Road Map

ABSTRACT: Lists the new documents to be produced and briefly describes their content.
Contains a description of the architecture framework specific to HNG-X by defining the
control objectives, security strategy, various models and trust relationships developed from
the business drivers and the non-functional requirements. Also contains a high-level roles
and responsibilities matrix.

5.1 Security Strategy

The security strategy for HNG-X uses the Prevention => Containment => Detection => Response model.

Item Description
Use a combination of security controls such as physical, network, platform and
Prevention application access control, system hardening and vulnerability management to reduce
vulnerability.
Containment Restrict the spread of malware or malicious activity using network segmentation, anti-
malware controls and physical, network and platform access control.
Quickly detect the presence of malicious activity or malware in any domain of HNG-X
Detection through the use of anti-malware, intrusion detection and security event management
controls.
Response Automatic or manual incident response to mitigate the activity using pre-configured

activities, intrusion prevention and incident response procedures.

This strategy provides defence in depth protection to the HNG-X system through the application of
layered security controls.

This model applies to both infrastructure and software development.

To reduce complexity and implementation times, the approach taken for applications and services is to
use internal Fujitsu services where appropriate and to buy and integrate COTS products.

one domain to another requires that they pass through an enforcement point. This enforcement point can
be an infrastructure control such as a firewall, or can be an application control such as a validation check,
digital signature check or access control check.

5.2 Platforms and System Layers
The definition of a platform in this document is taken from HNG-X Architecture - Platforms and Storage

(ARC/PPS/ARC/0001);

Platform Foundation: the combination of HNG-X approved hardware and a HNG-X approved operating
system for the purpose of hosting an HNG-X application, service or function in the HNG-X data centre;
the platform foundation is provisioned through an automated process

Platform: a type of server hosting a business application or infrastructure service that is part of the HNG-
X solution and hosted in the HNG-X data centres, a platform can have multiple instances and is build

from a Platform Foundation

Each system or device can be further subdivided into four additional layers and by using these it is
possible to define both the functions that take place at that layer and the security strategy for each layer.

The four layers are;
e Application
e Data
e Operating System
e Network

These layers are defined as below;

5.2.1 Application

This is the data processing and presentation layer utilising the services provided by the software and by
the other three layers of the model.

The strategy for the application layer is to prevent security incidents by ensuring that data is entered
correctly, processed correctly and is validated. This will be achieved through strict control of the
application development process and specific application security testing.

Exceptions detected by the application will be logged and an alert raised when the appropriate criteria
have been met.

Any passwords stored or transmitted at this level of the architecture must be encrypted or otherwise
obscured by using symmetric, (AES, TDES), or asymmetric encryption, (RSA), or by using a salted hash
algorithm.

Applications must only run in a user context that provides them with the rights and permissions they
need. This applies to COTS and bespoke software and applications.

During the detailed design stage, an analysis will be performed to assess the rights needs for the Counter
application, Tivoli agent, SSH daemon and Fujitsu bespoke software to ensure they do not have
excessive rights. This analysis will be documented with reasons for the decisions.

Wher this analysis establishes that administrative or super-user rights are required, their use is
permitted.

The hardening process will set the rights and permissions required by the platform.

5.2.2 Data

The data layer is responsible for the storage and management of application, platform and network
information.

The principle strategy for this layer is prevention. This will be achieved through the deployment of
Database access control with individual role-based accounts for each class of user to restrict the users
that can access the database, to control what actions those users can perform and to log all
administrative and other human accesses and command execution on a database to ensure an audit trail
exists.

Oracle databases will be configured in a secure fashion following the guidance contained in the Oracle
Database Security Checklist document attached as Appendix B.

The main classes of users at this level will be;

e Application — Those accounts used by the web services middleware tier to access the Branch
Database and accounts used by other systems for database access to either Oracle or SQL
Server Databases.

e System Administrators — Those operational support users with responsibility for managing the
database systems.

e Database Administrators — Those operational support users with responsibility for specific
databases.

For new databases, access for these users will be provisioned and controlled by the Identity and Access
Management service. Existing databases will be evaluated on an individual basis.

Application and transaction audit and event data are also managed at this level.

No new SQL Server databases are anticipated for HNG-X however existing SQL Server databases will
be reviewed in line with guidance from Microsoft on securing SQL Server.

5.2.3 Operating Systems

The major operating systems in HNG-X are Windows 2003 Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, Solaris
10 and, during migration, Windows NT4.

Using the security strategy of prevention, containment, detection and response requires that a secure
build, (the platform foundation), is created which is suitably hardened by removing unnecessary software
from the system, applying the latest relevant patches, setting file, application and user permissions
following the guidance in the Vulnerability Management section of this document.

Any passwords stored or transmitted at this level of the architecture will be encrypted or otherwise
obscured by using symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES or TDES, asymmetric encryption such
as RSA, a seeded hash algorithm or by using a recognised and approved authentication method such as
Kerberos. This is in addition to any network layer protection for data transmission.

5.2.4 Network

The network layer provides physical and logical network services for the other three layers. This includes
storage area networking.

The strategy for this layer is to prevent attack originating from outside the HNG-X infrastructure through
the use of a secure perimeter consisting of firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention.

Attacks within the HNG-X infrastructure will be prevented, contained and detected using network
segmentation, access control lists, firewalls, intrusion detection and intrusion prevention security controls.

Each control device or system will log to the Security Event Management service.

Network device access control will be provided by the Identity and Access Management service using
RADIUS/TACACS.

5.3. Control Objectives

The control objectives used in this document come from ISO27001 — The International Standard for
Information Security Management Systems and are employed as a method of providing a consistent and
abstracted approach to solving security issues.

The security requirements of HNG-X are mapped to the appropriate control objectives as documented in
Appendix A.

5.4 Documentation Set

Additional documentation will be produced to define the structure and support the design of the HNG-X
infrastructure and applications. These documents include topic architecture documents, SRSs, HLDs and
LLDs.

Figure [ SEQ Figure \* ARABIC ] — Secure Network Architecture - tiers

5.5.4.1 Intrusion Detection

Network-based intrusion detection is deployed throughout the HNG-X infrastructure, to provide immediate
notification of an attempted compromise of the HNG-x infrastructure and systems.

Network IDS appliances will be deployed in the Access tier to provide early warning of attempted
intrusion and to block attacks originating using the intrusion prevention capability of the appliances.
Appliances will also be deployed in the Distribution tier to protect the core systems of HNG-X and to
provide alerts of malicious activity internal to the HNG-X infrastructure.

The appliances will be sized to allow the monitoring of multiple physical network segments from a single
appliance. The appliances are designed to prevent traffic flowing between sensor ports. i.e. It is not
possible for the appliance to act as a Router and connect networks, thereby bypassing other security
controls.

Management of the IDS appliances will be provided by Core Services and will be provisioned using a
connection to the IMS LAN.

In addition to raising alerts of malicious activity, the IDS sensors will send feed event logs into the secure
event management service, to provide an audit trail and to enable additional event correlation with
Firewall, Router and other network device logs.

To reduce processing overhead on core HNG-X systems, host based IDS is not being deployed.
However, all hosts and network devices will send event logging information to the secure event
management service which will process the logs in real-time and raise alerts based on anomalous events
in the log files.

5.5.4.2 Counter Support Access

Remote support access to the Counter will be provided through the implementation of an SSH service
running on the Counter which can then be accessed from the Secure Access Servers, (SAS), in the Data
Centre. The SSH server on the Counter is configured with the SAS Server SSH public keys so that
connections to the Counter are restricted to only those originating from the SAS servers. This will allow
access to a command prompt on the Counter for the retrieval of logs and other data using secure copy,
(SCP).

All support user access will be audited at a command line level to ensure an audit trail of administrator
activity is available.

Firewall rules will be configured to ensure that the SSH and SCP traffic can only be initiated from the SAS
servers.

Access control for the SAS servers is provided using two-factor authentication by the Identity and Access
Management service.

5.5.4.3 Branch Network

From a security perspective, the Branch network is assumed to be insecure and therefore application
transaction traffic between the Counter and the Data Centre is encrypted using 128 bit SSL encryption
generated using standard Java VM APIs. This connection validates the identity of the Data Centre using
the Data Centre certificate and the authorised CA list configured on the Counter.

This connection is established prior to the application login prompt appearing for the user, to ensure that
any authentication information is encrypted. For normal business user logon, the password is not
transmitted across the network. For password changes, the password is also encrypted independently of
the network encryption to ensure protection after this traffic exits the SSL tunnel in the Data Centre.

FUJITSU [SUBJECT \* MERGEFORMAT ] &>

Post-HNG-X migration Tivoli management traffic will be encrypted using AES256 bit encryption to protect
it during transmission and storage.

An IPSEC tunnel will be created between the Data Centre and the Branch Router for management traffic.
This tunnel will be initiated when required for management purposes. It will not be possible to connect to
the Branch Router for management purposes using anything other than an IPSEC tunnel from the WAN
side of the Router. Local access from the Branch LAN is not permitted although access to Router log files
stored on one of the Counters, will be provided through the Counter Application.

Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention appliances will be deployed as described in section [ REF
_Ref152172121 \r\h] [ REF _Ref152172121 \h ] This will check all traffic from the Branch to the Data
Centre after it has been decrypted and all traffic going to the Branch from the Data Centre before it is
encrypted. Exceptions to this include SSH traffic originating from the SAS servers to the Counters,
however this traffic will be audited at a command line level so that all traffic across this encrypted link will
be recorded. Any use of other support tools such as SCP or SFTP will also be recorded to ensure an
audit trail is available in the event of an incident. For the purposes of this document it is assumed that this
is acceptable to Post Office Information Security and meets the requirement as expressed in SEC-3169
and SEC-3170.

Initially the intrusion prevention features of the appliances will be disabled to ensure that valid traffic isn't
blocked. As there will be a limited set of messages coming from the Counter / Branch, the intrusion
prevention facility will be tuned during the migration and early months of full operation to further protect
the Data Centre. Tuning will be based on the number and type of events noted during this period.

The IDS forwards events to the Security Event Management solution to ensure that alerts are raised
quickly and efficiently.

5.6 Secure Branch Access Layer Architecture

5.6.1 Application
Branch users will be authenticated using data in the Branch Database.

Middleware application software will be developed to ensure data are validated on entry to the application
where this is established as necessary by risk assessment during development. Field lengths, data types,
Counter IDs, session tokens and digital signatures will be checked and only accepted if valid.

The application will be developed to ensure that only valid transaction formats can be processed by the
system. This means that attempted buffer overflow and SQL injection style attacks will be blocked. How
this will be achieved will be established during detailed design.

The decision as to where and to what extent this validation is done will be established during the design
phase, as a result of the risk assessment conducted as part of the software development process
adopted for the HNG-X project.

Application passwords will be protected by SSL in transit over public networks. The password is also
encrypted independently of the network encryption, (using AES or TDES encryption), to ensure protection
after this traffic exits the SSL tunnel in the Data Centre.

Role based accounts will be maintained to provide Database access and these accounts will be
configured with only the permissions necessary to perform the functions required by the application.

The application software will be developed using the Java language and will follow coding guidelines
expressed in the existing Post Office Account Development Methodology and associated documents.

In particular the software will ensure that data are validated to prevent buffer overflow attacks, SQL.
Injections attacks, (largely negated through the use of PreparedStatement) and Cross-Site scripting
attacks.

5.8 Secure Counter Architecture

5.8.1 Application

To prevent replay attacks, the counter application must use a nonce or seed value that is unique for
every transaction. This will prevent an attacker replaying a previously captured transaction as the
application server would reject the repeated nonce value.

Data transmission is protected between the Counter application and the Data Centre through the use of
SSL. This control encrypts the traffic between the Counter application and the Data Centre thereby
protecting the username and logon information as well as transaction information. It also makes a “man in
the middle” attack extremely difficult as an attacker would need to obtain a copy of the Data Centre
certificate private key in order to intercept the traffic stream.

The Counter will be configured to only accept valid certificates issued by the HNG-X Certificate Authority
and will also check for new Certificate Revocation Lists, (CRLs), prior to the establishment of the SSL
session with the Data Centre. The CRLs will be distributed using the Tivoli software distribution
mechanism when needed.

Application passwords will be protected by SSL in transit over public networks. The password is also
encrypted independently of the network encryption, (using AES or TDES encryption), to ensure protection
after this traffic exits the SSL tunnel in the Data Centre.

In the development of the login and session management modules of the Counter application standard
cryptographic APIs will be used using RSA for digital signatures and using TDES or AES for data
encryption.

The Counter Application will use an underlying Windows NT/XP user context that only provides the
application with the minimal set of rights and privileges it needs to run.

* Refer to HNG-X Counter Business Applications Architecture (ARC/APP/ARC/0009).

5.8.2 Data

The Counter is intended to act effectively as a terminal to the HNG-x system in a complete departure to
how the current Riposte system within Horizon operates. As a result the Counter will provide no
cryptographic protection of any information within the file-store, nor will business transaction data be
written to the local disc.

In addition, local log files will not contain any sensitive data and data written to the platform swap file by
the operating system, will be dealt with as detailed in section 5.8.3.1.

e Refer to HNG-X Counter Business Applications Architecture (ARC/APP/ARC/0009).

5.8.3 Platform
e Refer to HNG-X Counter Architecture (ARC/APP/ARC/0003).

During migration the Counters in use will consist of a reducing estate of existing Horizon Counters and an
increasing estate of HNG-X Counters running the HNG-X Counter application and a Java Virtual Machine
on a Windows NT platform.

Following full migration the entire estate will be running the HNG-X Counter application and a Java Virtual
Machine on a Windows XP platform.

As part of the migration process, once the Windows XP HNG-X Counter system has been fully
implemented, any remaining obsolete Windows NT HNG-X Counter information, (applications or data),
will be securely overwritten.

Access to the Counter is managed and controlled by the Branch Database and not by the directory
service. The Counter is therefore implemented as a stand-alone Windows XP system with no domain
membership. This is to ensure the Counter application, middleware and Branch Database are not
dependent on an external system for their operation.

With the Branch Database controlling and managing access for the Counter application then the
resilience applied to the Branch Database does not need to be repeated on another system as there is no
external directory service. In addition, as all business users are dependent on the Branch Database being
available for the system to operate, there are no outside dependencies for system availability.

Anti-Virus software is not required on the Counter as the system will be operating in a restricted
environment with no access to email or Internet access. The system platform will be hardened using
guidance from a number of sources including the Windows XP Security Guide and 800-68 Guidance for
Securing Microsoft Windows XP Systems (NIST).

5.8.3.1 Other Controls

1) Counter application user runs with minimal privileges. The exact privileges required will be
established at the design stage.

2) Arisk assessment will be performed as part of the detailed design process to establish the extent
to which application and system cache, pagefile and other temporary storage areas should be
cleared and/or securely overwritten on the Counter. Platform level memory caching is not included
in this definition. The system will be configured not to dump memory to disk in the event of a
system crash unless forced for operational support purposes. Exact details will again be
established during the design phase as a result of risk assessment.

3) No sensitive data such as PINs, PIN blocks or PANs are written to the Counter hard-drive by the
application unless necessary for logging. In this case the sensitive data will be obfuscated through
over-writing, encryption or hashing by the Counter application. Details of how this will be achieved
will be established during the design phase.

5.8.4 Network

1) Private IP addresses, (RFC1918 range), configured for each Counter in a Branch.

2) Branch router firewall configured with basic access control lists to restrict traffic flowing between
the Branch and the Data Centre.

3) Personal firewall software configured on each Windows XP Counter that restricts application
access and controls which applications can run.

4) SSL encryption is instigated between the Counter and the Data Centre to protect application traffic
in transit. This authenticates the Data Centre to the Counter but has no role in authenticating the
Counter to the Data Centre.

5) Alerts configured for activated firewall rules.

6 Principal Security Services

ABSTRACT; Lists and describes the principal security services provided for HNG-X. Each
principal service is broken down into its key components and described in more detail.

The services below are used by the component parts of HNG-X and by each other to provide and deliver
security functionality.

6.1 Identity and Access Management

6.1.1. Service Description

The identity and access management service provides facilities to create, modify and remove users,
groups, roles and access permissions. The service controls access at an application and platform level
including both local and remote access. This includes access to operational support, system support and
data processing systems.

Management in the following list means provisioning, de-provisioning, authenticating and authorising;
1) Operational support users are managed using a directory service.

2) Branch business user access is managed using the Branch Database. This includes Engineers on
site visits to the Branch.

3) Accounts used solely by applications are provisioned using the directory service but are not
authenticated and authorised by the service. These are local accounts to the system being
accessed. (For example, local database accounts used by the Branch Access Layer to access the
Branch Database. These accounts will be provisioned using the directory service and a script to
create the users, as local users, in the Branch Database.)

The following facilities are supplied by the service;
¢ Provides identification
« Provides authentication
« Provides authorisation
e Provides accounting.
e Provides non-repudiation
« Provide role based access control.
¢ Provides network access control.
e Enables the addition, removal and change of users, groups and roles.
e Enables the addition, removal and change of network systems and devices.
e Enables segregation of duties.
¢ Controls and enables local and remote access for HNG-X.

6.1.2. Implementation

The service is implemented using a number of different technologies and is split between business users
and operational users.

6.1.2.1.3. Authentication and Authorisation

Branch user authentication and authorisation is a function of the Counter, Branch Access Layer and the
Branch Database. This is to ensure that the line of business application is a closed functional group
where the components of the group, (namely the Counter Application, the application server and the
Branch Database), are not dependent on other components for their operation.

Refer to Section 2.4.5 - Authentication/Authorisation Architecture in HNG-X Branch Access Layer
Architecture (ARC/APP/ARC/0004) for a description of the authentication / authorisation process.

6.1.2.2 Operational / Support / Other Business User

6.1.2.2.3. Authentication and Authorisation

Throughout the HNG-x infrastructure the same authoritative source of authentication and authorisation
data is used to manage access control for operational users. The purpose of this approach is to:

1) Reduce the number of passwords required for support purposes
2) Ensure better audit and logging facilities for authentication and authorisation

3) Streamline the process for adding, changing and removing authentication and authorisation
information

4) Provide a standard API to applications
5) Provide a standard method of authentication and authorisation throughout the estate.

To facilitate this approach a number of assumptions have been made. These assumptions are subject to
confirmation during the detailed design stage;

¢ Kerberos will be used for Authentication.

e This ensures that password details are never transmitted in the clear over the network, both at
initial logon and when subsequently accessing system and network resources.

e LDAP will be used for Authorisation.
e This provides fine-grained role-based authorisation.
e Windows 2003 Active Directory will be used for the Windows estate, (Excluding Counters).

e The proposed approach will offer satisfactory performance. This will be established during the
detailed design phase.

e The system will be designed to be resilient and available. Details of the technologies to be used
will be established during the design phase.

e Solaris 10 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems will authenticate using a PAM through the
Windows Active Directory service.

The Windows environment is managed using an active directory tree which controls access to resources
through the Windows 2003 Kerberos and LDAP implementations.

The UNIX environment is managed through the same Active Directory tree utilising a Pluggable
Authentication Module, (PAM), installed on each UNIX system.

Access to databases systems is provisioned using the Identity and Access Management service.
Database access is provided through the implementation of scripts to create database users using the
underlying OS user as a source.

This approach means that the Oracle Advanced Security option is not required for each database, but
does mean that a role-based access control matrix will need to be created for each database using a
standard set of roles across all databases.

Remote access using two factor authentication will be provisioned through the RSA Authentication Server
as for Horizon. The RSA Authentication Server will synchronise with the directory service to ensure user
data are up to date and consistent.

All administrative and super-user access to any component of a platform will also be controlled using two-
factor authentication.

Management domains using system management applications will also provide access and role control
appropriate to the operational functions they offer.

Platform event information detailing account logons & logoffs, object access, account management,
privilege use and directory service access, (and their failures), are all logged using the Event and Incident
Management service.

Network shares will also use the directory service for authentication and authorisation.
6.2 Secure Event Management Service

6.2.1. Service Description

The secure event management service acts as a subsystem of the overall event management solution.
There are two alternative approaches to be explored during the detailed design phase;

1) Through the deployment of log analysis and event correlation appliances and software, (currently
expected to be Tivoli Security Operations Manager or Network Intelligence appliances), logs will
be fed from the main event management system using a database link to aggregate and analyze
device log information.

2) Through the enhancement of the existing event management system to include logs from all
platforms and devices in the HNG-X infrastructure, (including firewalls, IDS/IPS systems and the
Identity and Access Management System), with the addition of a reporting capability using
appropriate software.

The following facilities are supplied by the service;
e Provides log aggregation, correlation and analysis.
e Enables security event alerting and reporting.

e Enables compliance reporting with standards and regulation such as ISO 27001.

(cither civil or criminal), evidence shall be collected, retained, and presented to conform to the rules for evidence laid
down in the relevant jurisdiction(s)

6.2.4 Implementation

Security Event and Information Management, (SEIM), is a key detective control in the HNG-X security
strategy acting as a central aggregation point for logs from all network devices, (such as switches and
routers), security devices, (such as firewalls, VPN terminators and the IDS), platforms, (Windows 2003,
Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Solaris 10) and Database, (Oracle 10g).

This solution works together with the SYSMAN event management solution to provide security related
intelligence in the analysis, alerting and reporting of log event information.

This service utilises the existing Tivoli event management infrastructure to forward critical security events
in real-time and less critical events as a batched process

A Certificate Authority, (CA), server will be implemented on an isolated network segment, (using firewall
rules), for the generation of Data Centre SSL certificates. These certificates will be used for identifying
the Data Centre to the Counter.

The certificate generated will have a lifetime of a maximum of 12 months and will be an RSA asymmetric
key pair, this will be confirmed during the detailed design stage.

If required, i.e. In the event of a Data Centre Certificate compromise or the creation of another valid
certificate due to a compromise of the CA, a Certificate Revocation List, (CRL), will be distributed to the
entire Counter estate using Tivoli. Counters will be configured to check the certificate's issuing CA
against an internal approved CAs list and also against the CRL.

The certificate will then be stored at the SSL termination point.
A Key Management workstation, (KMNg), will be created to manage cryptographic keys.
Automatic key management may be required to facilitate Tivoli software distribution.

Both the CA and the KMNg will be implemented on an isolated network in a physically secured area.
Logical access to the systems will be controlled and administered using the Identity and Access
Management Service. Console access will be the only way of using the CA and remote access will not be
possible.

All actions performed on the system will be recorded to establish an audit trail.

6) IP level security is configured to restrict traffic that can access the counter.

Following hardening of the platform foundation, an additional hardening step will be undertaken, when
necessary, to harden the platform. This will involve hardening instructions relating to Oracle and SQL

Server databases for example.

Guidance from the following sources will be used to establish secure platform foundation builds for each

operating system.

e Abase secure platform foundation will be established for each operating system.
e Antivirus software will be installed on all server platforms to mitigate the risk of malware.

e Platforms will log to the Security Event Management service for real-time event correlation,
analysis and alerting.

e Platform access control will be provided by the Identity and Access Management service.

6.4.4.2 Anti-Malware

An asset database will be maintained to record system configurations including system patch levels. This
will enable the relevance of newly released vulnerability alerts and patches to be efficiently assessed for
relevance and impact.

A Sophos anti-virus client will be installed on all server systems. The clients will be configured to perform
real-time analysis of files as they are accessed and processed by the system. Alerts raised by the clients
will be forwarded to the Secure Event Management Service. The detailed design process will establish
precisely the parameters needed for this process.

Anti-virus engine and signature updates will be distributed using the Sophos management console
following testing. These updates will be scheduled to avoid peak usage periods. It is not expected that
anti-virus signature updates will require significant testing.

The policy for dealing with malware will be based on the prevention, containment, detection and response
model. This is intended to reduce the impact of a malware outbreak and to ensure the HNG-X system
continues to operate.

Anti-virus will not be installed on Counters as compensating controls will be used to protect the Counter
and to contain the spread of any malicious code. These compensating controls are;

1) Hardened operating system
2) For Windows XP - Windows firewall configured to permit only the following traffic

a) Inbound — Tivoli, SSH from SAS Server, Syslog from Branch Router. Remote printing (on
gateway system only).

4) Branch and Data centre routers configured with access control lists to restrict traffic flow.
5) Data Centre firewall rule-sets configured to only allow application and management related traffic.
6) Intrusion detection/prevention implemented in the Data Centre.

These compensating controls are designed to prevent the spread of malware both within the Branch and
from the Branch to the Data Centre.

Intrusion detection is deployed throughout the HNG-X infrastructure using a managed service provided
by Fujitsu Core Services, to provide immediate notification of an attempted compromise of the HNG-X
infrastructure and systems.

Network intrusion detection sensors will be deployed throughout the network infrastructure to detect and
alert of potentially malicious activity.

In addition to raising alerts of malicious activity, the IDS sensors will send their event logs to the secure
event management service to provide an audit trail and for additional event correlation with Firewall,
Router and other network device logs.

To reduce processing overhead on core HNG-X systems, host based IDS is not being deployed.
However, all hosts and network devices will send event logging information to the secure event
management service which will process the logs in real-time and raise alerts based on anomalous events
in the log files.

6.4.4.3 Patch and Vulnerability Management

Patch and vulnerability management is a key preventive control is ensuring that the exposure level of a
system, application or device is reduced to an acceptable level.

This process will be managed by the CS Operational Security Management team and Test.

This service will ensure that an asset database is maintained, notification of relevant patches is obtained,
relevant patches are obtained, tested and applied to the live environment in an acceptable timeframe.

A process for evaluation and application of security patches will be established that will differentiate
between critical security patches and others.

All other patches will be assessed and those that need to be deployed will be tested and applied on a
quarterly or six-monthly basis. The exact timeframes for this will be established during the detailed design
process.

For Migration, HNG-X migrated systems will be subject to the new regime. Horizon systems will continue
as for current Horizon policy.
