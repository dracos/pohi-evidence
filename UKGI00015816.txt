Thank you for your further letter of 13 August 2000 on behalf of your group of Modified
Contract SubPostmasters, setting out, in the context of your collective concerns about the
treatment you and your colleagues are experiencing with Post Office Counters Ltd (POCL),

your personal experience in respect of cash shortages.

As promised in my letter of 22 August, in addition to writing to John Roberts, Chief
Executive of the Post Office, setting out in detail your concerns and stressing the need to
examine the range of issues relating to Modified Sub Post Offices (MPSOs) as a matter of
urgency, I have now also spoken to him directly about these concerns. He is now looking
into these matters carefully but has confirmed in the meantime that collective
representation of MSPO contract holders by the NFSP will be recognised from 1 October. I
should be grateful if you would convey this information your colleagues in the Modifieds

Striving for Parity Organisation.

I hope this information is both welcome and helpful.
