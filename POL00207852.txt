Subject: IMPORTANT - Second Sight Report (part 2) will be issued tonight
Lesley,

I hope you had a good break.

You received a copy of Second Sight’s report (part 2) from Andy last week. Andy is now on leave so I’m covering this
aspect in his absence.
I’ve just come off a call with Belinda, Roderick and the Fujitsu team, as the report is going to go out tonight.

The report is subjective and not particularly helpful. We disagree with large elements of this report, but Chris Aujard
has been unable to stop the report being issued. The report will now go out tonight to 9 Applicants and their Advisors
with a letter from the Chair to say it’s confidential and not for sharing. However, the risk is that this could now fall into
the public domain.

Belinda is orchestrating the response to the report which aims to be a standalone document stating the facts only
(and no subjective comment or critique) from both Post Office and Fujitsu which will refute what’s in the Second Sight
report and clearly state our position.

We have asked Fujitsu to consider whether they want to produce their own response. They are looking into this and
Post Office continues to govern this, but Belinda and Roderick think it might be helpful if another party other than the
Post Office is refuting the report. This is working thoughts and NOT a decision at the moment; so for now, it’s Post
Office that will respond to the report. This is being prepared by Andy Parsons now, but there’s no specific clarity on
when we might issue our response.

Tim — for info only in Andy’s absence.

Regards
Dave

It now appears almost certain that the Part Two report will go out to a small number of applicants and their advisors
this pm. It will be with them tomorrow. It is marked confidential and will go to under a letter from the Working
Group chair which will stress it is confidential. However, it has the potential to get into the public domain.

Could we have an urgent call to discuss this pm please. I will be available to do any time.

James, Rod suggested you might wish to include Mike Harvey?

Mel, copied is our comms person and I suggest that this will be a matter on which our comms teams will need to join
up just in case.

Best wishes
