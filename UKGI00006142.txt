Laura,

A short note would be helpful I have spoken to Harriet who confirmed that the note was sent to Oliver Letwin’s Office
after the Arbuthnot meeting but we have not had a response.

Kind regards
Andrew Smith

I noted down for the team here the non-Horizon points from the meeting with the Minister, which I have attached
here if helpful for you to see (note it’s not a formal note!)

On the Horizon discussion, the main points I took away were:

e POL wanted to flag their concerns around the Minister meeting Second Sight. They felt that doing so would
risk undermining her independence and distance from the situation, and were also concerned that if news of
the meeting were to leak to the media, it could risk individuals withdrawing from the mediation process (after
considerable efforts by POL to get these in the diary). Paula was also concerned that the Minister’s meeting
might conflict with any meeting Tim Parker decided to have with SS.

e BNR noted Paula’s views but felt it important to make the offer of a meeting to Second Sight and inform Mr
Arbuthnot that she was doing so. She suggested that the offer should be of a private meeting, and should
happen quite soon, so that it would take place before Tim Parker invites them to meet. It would be a short
meeting.

e After the call, we agreed that we would need to update Oliver Letwin’s office on the process, before offering a
meeting and replying to Mr Arbuthnot. The Minister also felt she should write to Mr Bridgen, possibly after
she had met Second Sight.

e The Minister agreed that the meeting with Sir Anthony Hooper was less important, and that it would be best
to wait until Tim Parker had met Sir Anthony and then decide whether she should meet him.

I have amended the letter that the Minister had approved to James Arbuthnot to reflect the outcome of the meeting.
In terms of updating Oliver Letwin, I can provide a short note if you would find that helpful (did any note go across
already after the Arbuthnot meeting?)

Let me know if you need anything else on this.

Thanks
Laura

The Minister has a phone call with Paula Vennells (POL CEO) tomorrow morning at POL’s request to discuss this issue.
We expect Paula will focus on POL’s concerns about the timing of any meeting with Second Sight (and Sir Anthony
Hooper). POL will be concerned that, once the news of any meeting becomes public, people will withdraw from the

mediation scheme in anticipation of a Government review.

We expect Paula will also want to discuss Tim Parker’s plans for his review on this matter, in particular who he intends
to meet (we expect this will include Second Sight and Sir Anthony, as well as Mr Arbuthnot and other parties).

Paula might ask the Minister to reconsider the timings of any meeting with Second Sight or Sir Anthony, and whether
this could happen after Tim Parker has completed his review, which we expect towards this end of this calendar year.

The Minister might like to have my submission (attached) to hand to remind her of the arguments for and against
meeting Second Sight.

Let me know if you need anything else before the call. I will sit in on the call with the Minister.

Thanks
Laura

Laura,

Baroness Neville-Rolfe would like to thank you for the update. She is content to see Second Sight and Sir Anthony. The
Minister has made some slight changes to the attached letters. The Minister does not think the order of the meetings
matters.

Finding time in the diary will be most difficult and she saw that you also want her to speak to Paula which doubly
comes fists.

The Minister feels we will then need to write to Mr Bridges.
Many thanks,

Charlie

As discussed, please see attached submission on the Post Office Horizon matter, covering the points we discussed
with the Minister after she met James Arbuthnot a couple of weeks ago.

Rob — it would be very helpful if Nick King could provide his views on this before it goes to the Minister.
Very happy to chat through if any questions etc.

Many thanks
