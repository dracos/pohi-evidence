EAGLE UPDATE

Nick Kennett explained that the Eagle negotiations were ongoing
and that the deadline of Tuesday 24” April was unlikely to be

portfolio valuation in the event of a ‘distress’ termination and move
to a new provider had still to be agreed.

Nick Kennett asked the Board to note a change to Appendix 4 of
the paper in that the payment to Bank of Ireland at ‘managed
termination’ would probably end up as zero and cannot be ‘less
than zero’ as presented in the paper.

Paula Vennells supported the network commitments in 4.3 of the
paper, but stressed the need to ensure the contract schedules align
to these commitments, as they had been agreed by Kevin Gilliland,

POLB11/54 (e

Paula Vennells circulated the new Executive Structure.

POLB12/28(b)

Questions were raised about the points covered in the Berkeley
report and the fact that the Board had not received validating
evidence of other organisations where the SI approach had worked.
