also collated onto one action sheet so that there is a clear line of sight of:

e Issue/Matter

e Identified By/ Raised By

e Impact to Business (or Potential Impact)

e Impact to Prosecutions (or Potential Impact)
e = Action

e Action Owner

e ~Resolution/Output

i, Rodric Williams; Susan Crichton; Hugh Flemington; Harding,

Jarnail
In response to your questions at 3 below:
a) Who is retaining this information.

Minutes have been taken of each meeting, along with action points. These have now been collated into the attached
Weekly Report (see attached — sorry for the delay in circulating this - usual security password).

The Weekly Report also provides an at-a-glance view of any issues that have been escalated for review to the
criminal law team (see column 3). This column highlights just those issues that have been investigated and deemed
as potentially having a material effect on criminal prosecutions. This column does not list every "potential" issue that
needs investigation — these potential issues are captured in the minutes of each meeting.

b) Who is hunting down the issues.

See the action points in the Minutes of each meeting. Going forward, I suggest that we are diligent in making sure that
past actions are followed up and closed.

c) What has been the precise problem in each case .

To the extent that details about a problem are known these have been captured in the minutes. However, this will
always be challenging because the discussions at the meetings can be quite fluid.

d) How was each case resolved.

Where closure on an issue has been achieved, this has been/will be recorded in the minutes. This is probably a weak
spot in the process so far and needs to be tightened up going forward.

John — these are just my thoughts on how to manage and capture this information. Do you agree? Comments
welcomed.

Kind regards
Andy

Subject: RE: : Regular Wednesday Call re Horizon Issue

John/Andrew

1) I understand the remit of the above meeting was to established a weekly conference call to act
as a central hub for all Horizon related issues. Attendees to bring all Horizon related issues that
they had encountered -minutes were to be taken, centrally retained and disseminated to those who
required the information. Most certainly the POL’s Horizon expert and QC would require this
information

2)Four telephone conferences meetings have taken place where the following issues were
raised:

1) Concerns that Post Office Card Account transactions have been “lost in flight”. (Meeting of
24/7/13 - Prestbury’s)

2) Mention of undefined bugs at Hordern - Not sure if they are being investigated. (Meeting of
24/7/13)

3) Possible case of Horizon receipt printing incorrectly - 4 instead of a 1 (Meeting of 24/7/13)

4) Issue where if the cashier presses buyback when selling Euros the loss won’t be found. Will
not generate transaction correction. It will
be a hard loss that the SPMR will not be able to explain when audited. (Meeting of
31/7/13)

5) Errors in the Bureau de Change when remmed in as a quantity not a value. (Meeting of
31/7/13)

6) The issue of ATM theft by an engineer was raised at the meeting of 31/7/13. This was raised
again at the meeting of 7in August 2013 - list of this engineers activity requested. problems as to
how far records will go.

3) In light of the above can you clarify the following please:

a) Who is retaining this information.
POL00139693
POL00139693

b) Who is hunting down the issues.

c) What has been the precise problem in each case .

d) How was each case resolved.

4) The contact details of each attendee need to be circulated among the group..
