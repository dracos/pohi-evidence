Hi Henry,

Thanks for your email.

There is clearly going to be a huge gap in what was proposed in December versus the new proposal from Tom. Iam
worried that Nick is feeling incredibly despondent, so we will need to manage this Nick is also asking me to meet strong
external candidates for a COO position (which we will be talking to you about in due course) and I feel that this

preparation for his succession which is healthy, but a worry too.

I do not know whether you have gone back to Tom, but I would like to have a further discussion with him, to request
that he tailors the retention payment to a shorter period ie the next 12 months (to get us through the Inquiry).

I anticipate that if we cannot achieve anything on his} GRO}; he will be wanting to have a formal discussion with us
regarding his future. anes

Are you happy I that pick up with Tom, or would you want to do this?
Kind regards,

Jane
