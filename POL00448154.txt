1. Introduction

At Post Office we have a blended learning approach to operational branch training. For new Branch Managers,
Postmasters and assistants it gradually builds up knowledge of Post Office products and services and how to
provide an excellent customer experience in branch. The aim is to ensure that new Branch Managers,
Postmasters and assistants can do the basics brilliantly and are safe, legal and compliant to trade.

The learning offer is also available to existing Branch Managers and Postmasters to train new people or to
provide refresher training.

In this catalogue we explain:

1. The blended learner journey for all new Branch Managers, Postmasters and assistants
2. How the operational training can be accessed by existing Branch Managers, Postmasters and assistants
3. The further operational learning available to all
We will also explain how the training is assigned to learners, how long it will take to complete, where to go to
for help with your learning needs and how to give us feedback on the learning offer.
Note: Throughout this document we will use the term Branch Manager to mean a postmaster, branch manager
or person in charge of running a Post Office branch.

2. Branch blended learning

When a new Branch Manager is appointed or an existing Branch Manager requests training, we ask for the
details of the individual learners. We then create the learner accounts and assign the online learning on our
web-based learning system. Learners receive an email confirmation.

The learning website can be found at postoffice.learning.uk.com

Note: It is also possible to go to the learning website and self-register for an account. Once approved, you can
self-assign any of the branch learning. See the ‘Summary of available training’ section of this catalogue.

We can also book the learners onto the face-to-face classroom courses. All learners need to complete the
online learning programme(s) before attending the classroom course, so we give everyone a few weeks to
complete it.

At the face-to-face courses learners consolidate what they have learned so far, use a Horizon training system
to practise transactions and practise the customer conversations. We also hand out an operational training
guide and work aids to support learners back in the workplace.

After that, if the branch has additional services such as ATM and/or a Camelot Lottery terminal there are
eLearning modules to complete before go-live. We then have further optional training available.

This is the Local/Main/Directly Managed branches onboarding learner process:

In-branch training

V10.0 June 2023

Learning aim:

The in-branch training builds on and embeds the learning from the online learning programme and the
classroom training sessions, providing on-the-job training when new Branch Managers and assistants start to
complete live transactions for the first time.

The on-site trainer also provides support for the set-up of a branch for a new Branch Manager.
The key elements of the in-branch support are:

* Upto six days of on-site learning from a Post Office Trainer
* Support in completing a Trading Period balance (follow-up balance)
Specialist ad hoc training for new (and existing) Branch Managers and assistants

A Business Support Manager is also assigned to the branch for the first six months and they will consolidate
and reinforce the training delivered. After that an Area Manager will take over the support of the branch.

Please note: No in-branch training is provided for new branch assistants in existing Post Office branches or
Banking Hubs. This should be completed by the existing Branch Manager, Banking Hub Operator or
Strategic Partner.
