[Root cause was deletion of stock unit, following stock unit rollover,
‘ith outstanding transactions carried out since the last EOD marker,
hich were lost. This is the subject of PINICLs 25876/8. Fix to

prevent SU deletion in such circumstances.

Fix (PWY_WP_5138 CSR) distributed to live estate 15/8

[Root cause was Stock Unit TM (the ATM stock at the outlet) being
rolled forward more than one CAP. The system error that allowed
his was corrected in the LT1 offices and incorporated into LT2.

855

27321
27871

IThis problem is associated with a missing mode on an outlet
ransaction, in this case a reversal of a previous cash settlement
transaction, which then failed to harvest . The fix for this was made
lunder root cause PinICL number 27871 which is fixed within WP
5406 and which was distributed to live on 23/8.

[This problem related to the incorrect handling of a “correction” SU
here the cash account snapshot and cash account report were run
jon different days on different nodes; the result was a doubling of the
brought forward total. This was fixed in the LT2 software and call

[closed on 5/7.

857

27319

IThis was caused by the use of a stock unit name starting with a
pace (““). The problem was alleviated at the outlet by deleting and
recreating the SU without the leading space. To prevent any
possible re-occurrence a fix to the software has been produced to
prevent SU names commencing with space character. The fix is
included within WP5406 which was distributed to live on 23/8.

858

25211

[Root cause was 2 transactions recorded without timestamp during a
jsession suspend/transfer operation and therefore not harvested. A
harvester fix was issued to cover this situation and authorisation for
the root cause fix (PINICL 25211) has been made. A separate
investigation (PINICL 27514) into the relationship between cash
account line 0099 exceeding value on line 1049 identified the root
(cause as user input error when dealing with Lottery cheque prize.
[This situation has not reoccurred in LT2.

859

INo E- reference was supplied and a search of Powerhelp calls
between 30/6 and 10/7 failed to identify the call details against likely!
joutlets (reported FAD 0105112). Probable cause null mode or
\deleted stock unit problem.

25878

[Deleted stock unit problem resulted in TIP not being passed
transactions. Earlier occurrence in 26258 (TIP 821) Underlying
PINICLs 25876/8, with fix distributed to live estate 15/8.

866

27748

IThis was the subject of Al410, concerning the change of products
\from “core” to “non-core”. Changes have been made to clarify
Operational Business Change procedures in this area which should
prevent this problem recurring. The problem arises only for

foucher transaction values, not for Value Stock. At Stock Unit
Balance time the system requires to access the item records to
jobtain the description of the item for inclusion on the balance report.
lif the item is not found the balance report prints ‘spaces’ for the
\description but then fails to create the balance summary record for
he product. This will be corrected to behave exactly as for Stock
tems.

ransactions. Earlier occurrence in 26258 (TIP 821) Underlying

In OBCS token administration suspend session then allowed a foil to)
lbe scanned and the transaction committed to the stack with no
current mode set, resulting in a non-harvested transaction. This is
actually a duplicate of PINICL 26181 and was fixed in WP4927,
applied as part of the LT2 baseline on 10/11 July. Its occurrence in
ITIP869 was during CA week 15, prior to the weekend LT2 fix.

870

27884

IThis call relates to several cash account discrepancies (5 outlets),
all due to transactions not being harvested because of missing
mode attribute on reversal transactions. Analysis of underlying root
cause is covered within TIP 855 (underlying PINICL 27871; fix
released 23/8)

873

27904

IThis related to a mismatch between electronic and TIP derived cash
accounts at 4 offices. This resulted from a one-off corruption of a
.dil file during the LT1 to LT2 upgrade at outlets 166328, 390329
land 008523.

IFAD 27153 was the subject of non harvested transactions due to
\missing transaction mode on the original counter transaction. This isI
the same underlying cause as TIP 874 (PINICL 27903)

874

27903
28167

IThis related to a mismatch between electronic and TIP derived cash
accounts at 5 offices.
[Detailed analysis of FADs 270329 and 203329 indicated that this
fas Caused by scales transactions (stamp sales) recorded with a
missing mode attribute. Analysis at the other sites (without a full
message store being available) indicated a similar root cause.
[27903 fixed in WP5447, which has completed test. Delivery to
joutlets expected by 29/8.
I28167 covers the agent avoidance to reconstruct missing “SC”
mode on transaction harvesting (all scales transactions are “SC”
mode), applied to live estate 3/8. This substitution will be ceased
hen TIP requests that we do so.

IThis incident describes itself as a summary of similar incidents.
[Pathway concurs with the view that they are simple repeats of
known causes, but will confirm this by detailed analysis.

IThis call is “Acceptance Incident” 411, which is being dealt with
separately. A fix is already in place and the missing transactions
have been sent to TIP.

Null mode scales transaction not harvested for week 18, which was
before both the harvester substitution work-around and the root
cause fix were released.

9908040139

IThis has the appearance of a transaction not harvested for week 19,
although there is no evidence of any transactions with ‘Null’ mode in
the outlet for this CAP. The call has been passed to the BSU for
further investigation with TIP.

(Compensating differences between cash and cheque lines. Under

9908160161

IThis was caused by a failure to harvest a transaction created to
correct a fee migration problem, due to a null user field. Harvester
incidents of this nature are reported to TIP via RED reports.

lit may be of interest that the value of the discrepancy between the
ITIP and Pathway figures appears to correspond to 2 x £230.63.
[During the balancing of stock unit AA on 18.8.99, a stock
jadjustment was made to reduce the value of Cheques (Product 2)
lby this amount, with a corresponding increase in Cash. These two
stock adjustment records were later individually reversed,
\generating a further 4 transactions for £230.63, 3 against Cash
(Product 1) and 1 against Cheques (Product 2). Therefore in total 4
(Cash transactions (two positive, two negative) and two Cheques
transactions (one positive and one negative) were written.

(Given that there have previously been issues with TIP's rejections
of

(Existing Reversal’ transactions where the reversal settlement
contained no cross-reference details, is it possible that this has
Icaused the

reconciliation failure? According to the message store data, the
(Cash

(Account for CAP 21 reported Total Receipts = Total Payments,
indicating that the message store data is complete and accurate.

IThe transactions rejected in this incident all relate to P&A
ransactions which have been recorded with a ‘Remittance’ mode.
\An error in the system at this time (which has since been corrected)
Icaused the application variable holding the current desktop ‘Mode’
(0 be incorrectly cleared, allowing OBCS to conduct a P&A
ransaction. When the transactions were passed to Riposte to
Icommit them to the message store, the Riposte Desktop mode at
the time (in all cases one of the Remittance modes, indicating that
the user was within the Remittance part of the menu hierarchy) was
added into the transaction data.
