Thanks Declan. On the point of honest Postmasters not being affected, it would be helpful, I think, for you to revert to
Carla and Tom who I recall had clear questions — but on that specific point and assuming Jeff is now agreed?

The policing of this type of risk more broadly is with Tim P I think — right Tim?

You then leave two questions open re RMG. My understanding is that we must always flag these issues with RMG and
that has been done in this case — Mark S copied. They are keen that we let the fraud run for a time so they can secure
the evidence for a conviction. Any questions of compensation can be and is dealt with through those normal commercial
channels.

Does that work for everyone?

Thanks Al

I think that we should discuss this further before we revert because in my opinion there is a loss to RMG (if labels are
printed and used on letetrs/parcels) and our consumables are being used for mails transactions. If we want to make ALL
transactions recoverable in Horizon this will require design, changes with Fujitsu and a slot for testing and release.
Thanks Jeff

Hi all,

My initial view on this is that there is not an issue here. I have copied Simon Oldnall (and Jeff) as I think his
perspective/understanding is worth getting.

My logic behind this not being a loss-causing issue is:

If the items are non-recoverable and power is lost, no onward settlement to a client has been processed in the
transaction, the Postmaster will not have been able to take payment for the items and net it is as though
nothing has happened. The resolution for the Postmaster is to re-process the items.

e If the items are recoverable and power is lost, the items return to the stack and the Postmaster ends the
transaction by taking payment, which is then onward settled with the client — net, the Postmaster takes the
payment that is then onwards settled leading to no loss.

So I don’t see a loss causing impact.

There could be an accidental gain if the Postmaster still took payment (not processing the payment through Horizon) as
a cash/cheque for non-recoverable items despite a disruption to power (rather than reprocessing the non-recovered
items).

Simon — what are your views? Is the above an accurate representation of how Horizon works for these transactions?

Kind regards,
T

I thought the last paper for noting on mails fraud was rather disturbing.

The paper focuses on fraud risk but the concern it raises for me is about the integrity of Horizon records and postmaster
accounts.

On the face of it, it looks like records are lost when the Horizon is switched off in branch. In this case fraudsters used it
to their advantage. But it could also happen in a BAU context eg if there is a power failure. It seems very strange that

Horizon would allow a label to be printed without there being a simultaneous record of the transaction being logged in
the system for revenue recognition purposes.

There were several cases in the GLO where postmasters blamed power outages for their losses.

So unless I’ve misunderstood this, it looks like this could be a rather important issue for the business and yet another
post GLO fix. Also something that warrants a fuller discussion at ARC or Board — and has this been disclosed to

claimants?
