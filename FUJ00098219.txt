The UnconnectedBroadcastInterval configuration item specifies the interval at which connections will be established to non-
permanent neighbors, provided that the current marker of the message server differs from the last marker received from the
neighbor (this check ensures that the connection will only be established when there is synchronization that needs to occur

with the neighbor).

Note that currently the same interval is applied to all non-permanent neighbors. This may change in a future release to allow a

finer degree of tuning.
