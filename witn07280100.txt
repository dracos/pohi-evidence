                     FIRST STATEMENT OF MARK MCLEAN




I, Mark McLean, will say as follows. ..


   1. Until leaving Royal Mail Group in 2015, 1 had undertaken a myriad of roles

       across the group from Postal Delivery Cadet (1984) through to an Operations

       Manager working alongside my present employer, Bank of Ireland.



   2. From reading through the documentation, there appears to be a single

       reference to NBSC. NBSC was a supportfunction thatwas in place before

      Horizon was even a programme & it was during this period that I was

      involved. All of my comments are based on these facts so I am a little unclear

      as to the value my statement will provide.



   3. My primary role was working within the NBSC as a telephone agent before

      moving to head up the team. As I have stated above, this was at a time when

                                          Page 1 of 3

                                                                                 WITN07280100




   the responsibility of this service desk was to support subpostmasters on

   operational queries. As branches started to migrate to Horizon these

   branches were managed by the Fujitsu helpline, which was outside of my

   remit/responsibility.



4. My recollection is that prior to & during thistime the `then NBSC' (managed by

   Post Office) were given little more than `awareness' training as there was no

   expectation that we would be managing/servicing the calls as they were all to

   be undertaken by the Fujitsu helpdesk. During this time I was not involved in

   any projects, meetings or initiatives in relation to Horizon other than migrating

   the telephone management to the new provider. My responsibility was to

   manage the network who had yet to migrate & for those branches that had

   migrated, to direct them to the Fujitsu helpdesk.



5. I think that it would be fair to say that the 'then NBSC' were very sympathetic

   towards the subpostmasters who were calling as they did not feel that the

   Fujitsu helpdesk was supporting them in the manner that they had become

   accustomed to. The team had established good working relationships with

   the subpostmasters that called the NBSC before it started to migrate to the

   new provider. By the nature of the calls that we were handling it was clear

   that subpostmasters were becoming hugely irate/frustrated &, unfortunately

   we did not have the knowledge to supportthem. I can not really comment on

   the service they received from the new NBSC.

                                                                                     WITNO7280100




   6. I don't believe that the role that I held during this period would offer any real

         insight that could inform/influence this investigation.
