10. Key Messages

Why ~ To simplify our processes, enhance our offer to clients, provide space for frontline people to sell, improve accuracy,
increase speed of reconciliation and drive down costs.

What ~ The $60 release will enhance Automated Payments (AP) functionality with Additional Data Capture (ADC) ~ DVLA
is first client to benefit. We will link online to DVLA for verification of the new style MOTs. We will introduce Postal Address
Finder (PAF) as a standard feature offered for new AP-ADC transactions or as an enhancement to existing transactions.
(PAF) capability will initially link to smart post for a limited number of transactions.

We will be also launching the new External Data Gateway (EDG) that will allow data files to be passed to clients without the
reliance on a third party or the development of individual connections.

Impact aims to deliver a new financial accounting system by mid 2005. Phase one will include automation of the pick up of
ONCH (Over Night Cash Holdings) in branches - helping Post Office Ltd to manage its cash more effectively, and the
automation of the tracking system for Remittances - giving better control over the exact whereabouts of cash rems in the
system and enabling a tighter accounting process.
