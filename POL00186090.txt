Gavin, Andrew,

I confirm that our meeting this Wednesday will be held at 148 Old Street (we finally found a room!).

In advance of the meeting, I attach the “Spot Reviews” we have received and our current draft responses.

We will discuss these responses at the meeting, with a view to producing a stand-alone document which sets out our
definitive position on the issue raised in the “Spot Review”. We must assume that the final response will enter the
public domain, so we need to ensure that it is robust, defensible and properly protects/advances Post Office Limited’s
case.

I look forward to beefing you on Wednesday. Please let me know of you need anything else in the meantime.

Kind regards, Rodric

As requested I attach original Spot Reviews. SR 11, 12 and 13 have been through final revision and peer
review. SR1 is at first draft and I have included Fujitsu email (pending their legal authority to release).

Kind regards,

Ivan
