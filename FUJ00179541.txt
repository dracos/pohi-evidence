Hi everybody,

I’ve finally gone through it all. Attached is the version with everybody’s comments.

There are a couple of my comments that suggest that Gareth S may like to add clarifications, but I see he had not
picked up on those areas,

Please let me know if you need anything further.
Best wishes

Gareth

IMPORTANT - This email or attached documents contains legal advice (or relates to litigation or anticipated litigation) and is being provided in
circumstances for which Legal Privilege may be claimed. Do not copy or forward this document without permission.

Alan, Gareth S and Gareth J,

Please see attached Torstein’s draft witness statement. He has asked that the three of you review it and provide any
feedback / clarifications; he is next working on Tuesday 25", so it would be ideal if your comments could be fed back
to him by the end of Monday.

Note that currently the draft has been provided to Torstein by WBD based on a previous statement with yellow
highlighted sections where WBD are asking specific questions, and as you can see, Torstein has made amendments as
tracked changes, and added comments.

Please would you copy Pete Newsome, Dave Ibbett and me in on your responses back to Torstein; if you need any
clarification in the meantime probably best to go back to Pete.

Thanks
