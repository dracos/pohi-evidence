I, Jarnail Singh, will say as follows:



     1. I am providing this statement following two requests for information dated 22

         June 2023 and 18 August 2023, pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules

         2006, regarding matters falling within Phase 4 of the Inquiry: action taken by

         Post Office Ltd against Subpostmasters.



     2. The requests contained a combined total of 224 questions, which I have

         addressed below. Some of the questions are centred around cases or

         subject matters to which I had limited involvement and the events of which

         were over nearly 20 years ago. I have therefore found it difficult at times to

         recall detailed information and have had to regularly rely on the information

         contained in the documents given to me by the Post Office Horizon IT

         Inquiry ("the Inquiry") as part of the Rule 9 request. However, this statement

                                         Page 1 of 89
                                                                                    W ITNO4750100
                                                                              WITN04750100




   is made to the best of my recollection and where I cannot remember

   something or have had to rely on a document, I have made it clear.




3. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my sympathy to all

   subpostmasters who were wrongly accused of offences due to the Horizon

   IT system. As a criminal prosecutor, I always do my best with the knowledge



   postmaster case, I followed the relevant codes, policies and procedures and

   genuinely thought that I was doing the right thing. I was therefore incredibly

   shocked and saddened when I learnt that the subpostmasters who were

   prosecuted were not at fault.




4. I can confirm that I am represented and have had legal assistance in writing

   this statement. When seeking to obtain legal assistance, I was assisted by

   the Post Office with the initial stage of confirming the availability of

   insurance coverage, to cover the associated legal costs.




5. I have been asked to set out a summary of my career and qualifications. I

   have attached a copy of my curriculum vitae, which provides these details

6. 1 was a senior lawyer in the Criminal Law Team ("CLT") at the Royal Mail

   Group Ltd ("RMG") and later at Post Office Ltd ("POL"). I joined the RMG as

   a legal executive in December 1989 and then, upon qualification in around

   1992, I became lawyer and was subsequently promoted to a senior lawyer

   in the CLT. At RMG, I would deal with criminal prosecutions, the relevant

   cases of which are given in this statement. On 1 April 2012, I was

   transferred to POL.



7. When I transferred to POL, I was the only in-house criminal lawyer and POL

   contracted all of their criminal prosecutions out to Cartwright King solicitors

   ("CK") who took over full responsibility for the lifetime of a case. At this

   point, my role in relation to criminal prosecutions was limited. I would

   provide input where requested and was copied into case correspondence

   for information. However, in the main, I acted as a point of contact between

   POL and CK and would request or forward information as and when

   required. Although I would read the advice given by CK, I never made the

   decision as or when to prosecute and under what charges.



8. I left POL around March 2015. 1 subsequently moved into commercial f

   residential law.

     9. The below gives an account of the policies and practices in place and the

         CLT's role relating to the prosecution of subpostmasters.



     10. By way of overview as to the procedure when criminal prosecutions were

         conducted at RMG, following an investigation, an Investigation Officer within

         RMG would send a `green investigation file' to the CLT. The investigation

         file and its papers would then be reviewed by the head of the CLT and the

         file would be allocated to a criminal lawyer within the team to provide advice

         on prosecution. Each case would be considered in accordance with the two

        stages of the Full Code Test within the Code for Crown Prosecutors ("the

         Code") and RMG's own internal policies and procedures on prosecuting

         cases. I cannot comment on the procedure for cases which were dealt with

         by CK.



The rationale behind >he practice of brinting__private prosecutions



     11.At the time of my employment at both RMG and POL, all potential cases

         were investigated and prosecuted by POL / RMG, rather than being referred

         to the Police or Crown Prosecution Service. I was not involved in the

         rationale behind the reasoning for this as it was put in place long before I

         started, but I was aware that this was the common practice with other public

         and Customs.



Policies governing prosecution and charging decisions and the conduct of

prosecutions



     12. In consideration of the policies governing prosecution and charging

          decisions, and the conduct of prosecutions, I have reviewed the following

          documents:



         i.    Post Office Internal Prosecution Policy (Dishonesty) (December 1997)

               substantially the same as the policy of the same date with a variation

               on the title (POL00104812) (see, in particular, section 3);

xviii.    Post Office Limited Prosecution Policy for England and Wales (version

          1, 22 January 2016) (POL00030811).



13. 1 can confirm that during my time as in-house criminal lawyer, I was familiar

     with the policies listed above save for the final document listed as this post-

     dates my employment with POL. At the time, I was primarily concerned with

     the Prosecution Policy, but less familiar with the other policies. I can recall

     that when we drafted the initial advice, we did so from a template, which

     prompted you to review, stage by stage, every evidential aspect of the

     Prosecution Policy and Disclosure Policy.



14. I was not involved in contributing or developing any of the policies listed




     1.0) (effective from 1 April 2012) (POL00031034). By being owner' of a

     prosecution policy, it means that I adopted the policy on behalf of POL on its

     separation from RMG.



16. It was the policy of POL to prosecute those suspected of committing theft,

     fraud and / or false accounting, as it had been the policy of RMG

     to account and to deter potential offenders. POL would, however, only

   prosecute if they were satisfied that the Full Code Test in the Code had

   been rnet.



17. In terms of the organisational structure of the CLT, I can recall that around

   1995 the structure was: Head of the Criminal Law Team, 7/8 criminal

   lawyers, 3 legal executives, 3 support staff and 5 secretaries. To be clear, I

   was one of the criminal lawyers.



18. The structure subsequently changed gradually over time with people leaving

   and was reduced to: Head of CLT, 3 lawyers, 2 legal executives, 2

   secretaries and 1 admin staff. To confirm, when RMG and POL separated

   on 1 April 2012 and I was transferred to POL, I was the sole in-house

   criminal lawyer. It was at this point that POL contracted CK to prosecute on




   Security Team. I note that the Inquiry have referred to a `Fraud Team'. From

   memory, the Investigation and Security Team and the Fraud Team are one

   and the same and therefore, going forward I shall refer to them as the

   Investigation and Security Team.



20.Once received, the investigation papers (green sleeve file) were passed to

   CLT who would assess the evidence and provide advice in relation to

   prosecution and charges. The decision to prosecute was taken by the

   Investigation and Security Team, for those cases where there was a


                                 Page 8 of 89

                                                                                 WITNO4750100




   decision to prosecute. If the case was local (in or around London), CLT

   would continue to deal with the case and occasionally I would do the

   advocacy for the administrative hearings in the Magistrates Court. If the

   case was further afield, CLT would contract one of the agents on their panel

   to deal with the case for them.



21.The people responsible for supervision and conduct of prosecutions were

   the Head of Security and Head of the CLT. Counsel, who was instructed on

   the case and the lawyer with conduct over the case, would also keep it

   continuously under review in accordance with the Code.



22. I do not know what qualifications or training the Head of Security or Head of

   CLT had although I can recall that Counsel and agents for each case would

   have had training on the workings of the Horizon IT system. I also attended

   training on the Horizon IT system, first in the late 90s and later in 2012.



23. At RMG, the Head of CLT and the lawyer dealing with that particular case,

   was responsible for supervising and reviewing the conduct of the

   prosecution. At POL, the supervision and review of a case was done entirely

   by CK although they would occasionally ask for my input.




24. I cannot recall that the Post Office policy regarding prosecution of Crown

   Office employees was any different from the policy and practice regarding

   prosecution of sub-postmasters and their managers / assistants.

25. 1 can confirm that I have reviewed the Separation Project — Criminal

   Investigations Policy for Post Office Ltd (POL00104900) and the

   Prosecution Policy Paper dated January 2013 (POL00039969).



26. These would have been used by the Investigation and Security Team when

   conducting investigations. There were no changes to the policies when POL



   policies.

   paragraph 2.4 of the January 2013 Prosecution Policy Paper

28. 1 worked closely with Martin Smith and Simon Clark (both of CK) and we

   would discuss any cases as and when needed. However, I was more

   involved from an administrative, rather than legal, perspective.



29. 1 have been asked to describe the `network of external legal agents and

   Counsel' used to manage the prosecution process. These were used by



   Wales and Scotland to deal with cases when we didn't have the resources

   to deal with them or if the case was located a long way away from London. I

   cannot recall the exact number and full list, but I remember that the main



   Birmingham (Solicitor advocate) and Cardiff Chambers. From 2012

        onwards, POL used CK exclusively who had their own in-house Counsel

        and lawyers.



     30. 1 was not involved in the analysis conducted by POL and referred in the

        Prosecution Policy Paper dated January 2013 (POL00039969).



Involvement of the Criminal Law Team in advising on investigations



     31. I did not have any involvement into the input or formulation of any policies or

        guidance. At POL, previous RMG policies and guidance were simply

        adopted. Due to my lack of involvement, I cannot confirm or deny whether

        CLT approved advice on the application of relevant codes of practice issued

        under statute guidelines, case law and any relevant material.



     32. I do not know whether the CLT had any role in the provision of training to

        members of the Investigation and Security Team involved in criminal

        investigations, although I personally did not give any training to the

        Investigation and Security Team when I was in RMG. However, on

        separation of the businesses, I made arrangements with CK to provide

        training for the Investigation and Security Team.



     33. When I was at RMG, my advice memos to the Investigation Team would

        give advice as to what additional witness statements/evidence were



        cases as to what investigations to make or lines of enquiry to pursue.

        providing any advice on this when I was at POL, although CK may have

35. At the outset, I would like to flag that I was not involved in any guidance

      provided to the Security Team on the conduct of investigations and had no

      input into it at all. My comments below are based on a review of the

      documents.

      Management Document. I did not have any input into these documents and

      I was not involved in the development, management or amendment of them.

      My knowledge is that it was the Information and Security Team who would

      have been responsible for them and would have used them.



37. I did not deal with these documents and the instructions / guidance given in

      them was for the Security Team as part of their training as to how to put

      investigation reports together. My understanding of them now is therefore

      not based on any prior knowledge. I have reviewed them and understand

      that they are giving instructions as to the content and presentation of

      Investigation Reports.

                                                                                   WITNO4750100




38. As to the relevance of these instructions, in relation to Post Offices'

   disclosure obligations, my view is that the instructions clearly required

   investigators to put the separate report on Form CS006D and possibly

   CS6006E when reviewing the case. My role would have then been to review

   those documents and decide whether they were disclosable or not. Had the

   documents disclosed Horizon bug errors and defects, my duty was to

   disclose these documents to the Defence as they were documents which

   would undermine the prosecution case and assist the defence case.



39. At the time the suite of compliance documents contained within the

   compliance zip file was circulated (listed at 'ii' above), I considered their

   status as guidance, in that I understood that their purpose was to be used

   as guides, given to investigators by senior managers of the Security Team.

   To my knowledge and recollection, the CLT had no input and I, personally,

   certainly did not have any input into them.



40. There are two documents, both entitled `Guide to the Preparation and

   Layout of Investigation Red Label Case Files. Offender report and Discipline

   reports' (POL000118101 and POL00115671). As to how these relate to the

   Offender Report Template (POL00118102), my understanding of paragraph

   2.15 (on p.10) in the first of these documents (POL00118101), is that a

   comprehensive list of all failures in security, supervision, procedures and

   product integrity must be highlighted bold in a Suspect Offender Report. I

   understand that both documents give guidance as to the preparation of

   Suspect Offender Reports. I therefore assume that these documents

        informed the content and creation of the Offender Report Template. I do not

        feel able to comment on these documents beyond what is stated in there as

        1 a iTiuii.i1I1iT17i1



     41. The Inquiry refers to the email of 23 May 2011 (POL001 18096) and email of

        29 March 2012 (POL00115665) as my emails. However, these were emails

        sent by Dave Posnett and I was not a recipient of either.



     42. I had no involvement in drafting the documents entitled identification codes

        (POL00118128) attached to David Posnetts' email of 25th May 2011

        (POL00118128) and 29th March 2.012 and (POL.00118131) attached to

        email dated 28th July 2016.



     43. I cannot say why the Security Team investigators were instructed to assign

        identification codes to suspected offenders as I was not part of any decision

        or conversation in this matter. I cannot recall reviewing the document

        entitled 'Identification Codes' .



Process for prosecution and charging decisions



     44. The below considers the process that was followed by POL/RMG in relation

        to prosecution and charging decisions once an initial investigation had been

        conducted by the Security Team. In answering the Inquiry's questions

        around this subject matter, I have reviewed the following documents:

45. The `nominated decision maker' within the Security Team was responsible

   for making prosecution and charging decisions in respect of

   subpostmasters, managers, assistants and Crown Office employees alleged

    to be responsible for shortfalls shown by data from the Horizon IT system.

   At POL, the person responsible for this was the Head of Security, John

   Scott. This decision would be taken after seeking input from the CLT and

   subsequently by CK when they took over conduct of criminal prosecutions.



46. The legal advice and draft charges would be drafted by CLT/CK and sent to

    the Investigation and Security Team. The decision maker would then read

    the advice and decide, at that stage, whether or not to accept the advice

   and prosecute. If they decided to proceed, they would get the Investigation

   Officer to issue the summons at the local Magistrates' Court.



47. l cannot comment as to what training or qualifications all those providing

    legal advice on prosecution, draft charges and charging decisions had, but

         certainly within the CLT everybody was a qualified lawyer as far as I can

         recall.



     48. 1 cannot recall whether those involved in investigating a suspected offence

         ever input into advice on whether the test for prosecution was met.

         However, any case that I looked at, I would have considered in line with the




The test applied



     49. The below considers what test was applied by those making prosecution

         and charging decisions. I can confirm that in answering the Inquiry's

         questions on this, I have reviewed the following documents:

50. I cannot comment on others, but I can confirm that I would always consider

    the evidential and public interest test in reviewing and drafting my initial

   advice and throughout the subsequent lifetime of a case. In my view, the




51.At the outset, legal advice was all given internally by CLT / OK. When the

    matter was committed to the Crown Court, once instructed, Counsel were

   asked to draft the indictment and in doing so, look at the summons, and

   also to provide advice on evidence. Essentially they would revisit and review

    the whole case.



52. When I was asked to advise on a case, I would that the advice had regard

    to both the Code and relevant POL policies. It was a matter of policy that all

        advice and decisions were made in line with the public interest and

        evidential tests of the Code.



The conduct of prosecutions



     53. When conducting a prosecution, during my time at both RMG and POL I

        was alive to all of my responsibilities and duties under relevant legislations,

        codes, policies and principles including, but not limited to:



         i.   The Code (and related CPS guidance)

        ii.   Attorney General's Guidelines on Disclosure

       iii.   SRA Standards and Regulations

       iv.    Internal policies and procedures as listed at paragraph [15] above

        v.    Criminal Procedures and Investigations Act 1996



     54. Initially, RMG had conduct of private prosecution and then, on separation of

        the businesses, this was CK. The role of the agents was to attend Court on

        behalf of the RMG and conduct the prosecution.




     55. The Polices would incorporate the relevant legal legislations, codes, policies

        and principles and give guidance on how to comply with them.




                                        Page 20 of 89
                                                                                    W ITNO4750100
                                                                                WITN04750100




56. I was not involved in and therefore cannot comment on, what guidance was

   given in the RMG / POL policies about disclosure from third parties, such as

   Fujitsu. Any disclosure from a third party would have been requested from

   the Investigation Officer who was assigned to that case.



57. As to my understanding of disclosure obligations, I am aware of the

   obligations on a prosecutor to ensure that all relevant disclosure is given to

   the defence, including that which may undermine the prosecution case. The

   duty to review disclosure and subsequently disclose where necessary, is

   ongoing.



58. I have been asked whether the individual(s) who held the role of disclosure

   officer also held the role of Investigation Officer and / or decision maker. I

   am unable to answer this question as I have no personal knowledge.



59. In terms of disclosure when was at CLT, an individual from the

   Investigation and Security Team would prepare a disclosure schedule with a

   list of the relevant and appropriate documents. This would be sent to CLT,

   as part of the initial papers sent with the investigation report. The CLT

   lawyer who received the papers, including me if I was allocated the file,

   would review the disclosure and check that everything in it was relevant and

   disclosable. If I felt that anything was missing, I would request it and, once

   satisfied, serve the disclosure on the Defence as appropriate. My disclosure

   duty was ongoing and therefore if I received or was made aware of a

   relevant document at any point in the lifetime of a case, I would disclose it


                                 Page 21 of 89
                                                                                     W ITNO4750100
                                                                                   WITN04750100




   as appropriate. I would also deal with any disclosure requests received from

   the Defence. To be clear, I was never the disclosure officer, as this was the

   role of somebody within the investigation and Security Team.



60. I have been asked whether the individual(s) who held the role of

   Investigation Officer, officer in charge and / or disclosure officer, also made

   decisions about the conduct of prosecutions. Due to lapse of time, I cannot

   confirm or deny whether this was the case or not. However, if the

   Investigation Officer had made the decision on conduct of prosecutions then

   I would have had concerns about that.



61. I have been asked what advice I or the CLT more widely, gave to

   investigators from the Investigation and Security Team about the disclosure

   obligations in POL. I was the only in-house criminal lawyer at POL at the

   time and I cannot recall specifically giving advice on disclosure obligations

   to the Information and Security Team. However, had I been asked to give

   such advice, I am confident that I would have emphasised the importance of

   complying with the disclosure obligations and that it was a ongoing

   obligation. I cannot confirm or deny whether CK provided such advice on

   disclosure to the Investigation and Security Team.



62. I never dealt with third parties and so my role never included giving any

   advice in relation to disclosure to third parties. The only exception to this

   was in the case of Mrs Misra, when the Security and Investigation Team

   asked me to obtain answers raised by the Defence about the functioning of


                                 Page 22 of 89
                                                                                    W ITNO4750100
                                                                              WITN04750100




   the Horizon system and I contacted the Head of Legal at Fujitsu to escalate

   this request. Further information on this is given below and the contact did

   not include giving any advice on disclosure, other than to request it.



63.Once a case was committed to the Crown Court, Counsel were briefed to

   draft the indictment and provide advice on evidence.



64. When I was at RMG, I did not seek any external advice on the Horizon IT

   system, with the exception of the case of Mrs Misra.



65. Once the Defence Case Statement or Defence Statement were received, I

   would ensure that it was dealt with appropriately and that any further

   disclosure that was raised, was also disclosed where relevant. I would

   ensure that the statements and enclosures were sent to Counsel to advise

   on and the Investigation Officers to deal with and provide. This was before

   separation of the businesses. On separation, CK took over control of the

   disclosure as well as all aspects of prosecution.



66. In addition and as noted in the cases below, for example the case of Mr

   Wilson, where potential issues were raised about the Horizon IT system, I

   would always request a witness statement to address the IT issues.

   However, as happened in Mr Wilson's case, the sub postmaster pleaded

   guilty to the false accounting offence while the collation and service of such

   further evidence was still pending.

    67. 1 cannot provide any further comments where it was alleged in a Defence

          Case Statement or Defence Statement that a discrepancy was attributed to

          problems with the Horizon IT system as, other than the case of Mrs Misra, I

          cannot recall dealing with any cases where this was alleged.



Experts



    68. In the cases that I personally dealt with, no experts were instructed and I

          was not made aware by any other members of CLT or external agents, of

          any experts being instructed in respect of any other cases either.



    69. In the case of Misra, the Defence expert Report raised questions and I

          contacted the Investigation and Security Team to ask whether they could

          answer these questions. I was told that the request needed to be made in

          writing and it could take weeks for a response. I was worried that the normal

          systems and procedures for obtaining information from Fujitsu would be too

          slow and so I also contacted David Jones, Head of Legal at Fujitsu, to

          escalate the request so that it would be dealt with as quickly as possible to

          comply with the Court Order. Subsequently, Gareth Jenkins was put forward

          to deal with the Defence's requests as someone who was in a position to

          deal with the issues raised by the Defence expert, but I understand that his

          role was initially limited to that of a lay witness who knew the Horizon

          system well. As far as I can recall the Post Office did not seek to rely on him

          as an expert witness, or at least not initially. Subsequently, due to his

          expertise and qualifications, the Court considered him an expert.

70. Document UKG100015008 references a meeting which I attended with

   Gareth Jenkins, Warwick Tatford and John Longman in October 2010. 1 do

   not recall this meeting or ever discussing Gareth Jenkins' witness statement

   with him. As far as I recall, I had very limited involvement with Mr Jenkins. I

   cannot recall any discussions where he was informed of his duties to the

   Court, although I would have assumed Counsel would have informed him of

   the same.



71. 1 am not aware of and I do not recall any policy or guidelines in place

   regarding the provision of evidence by employees of Fujitsu.



72. Given that the Horizon IT system was a unique system, I felt that the

   questions from the Defence should be answered by somebody who knew

   the system well . Mr Jenkins was put forward as such a person and my

   understanding was that he had the most experience and knowledge of the

   system to provide full answers and analyse the data in full and I therefore

   considered him to be an appropriate witness. I understood that it was made

   clear that Mr Jenkins was an employee of Fujitsu. I knew that his Section 9

   statement told him that he had to be truthful otherwise he would be liable for

   prosecution. With the benefit of hindsight, I can see that it would have been

   more appropriate for somebody from outside of the organisation to have

   been utilised who could have been relied on as an expert witness. However,

   I feel that it would have been difficult to find somebody who was an

   independent expert, who had the experience and knowledge of the Horizon

                                                                                       WITNO4750100




        IT system, but did not work at Fujitsu. I did not feel that a person without

        such knowledge or expertise of the Horizon IT system would be in as good

        as position to assist the court as a lay witness with that specific knowledge.



Criminal enforcement proceedings



     73. I have been asked in what circumstances steps were taken to restrain a

        suspect's assets by criminal enforcement methods such as confiscation

        proceedings. I am unable to answer this question as the decision to start

        confiscation proceedings was made by the Confiscation Department.



     74. I have also been asked who decided whether criminal enforcement

        proceedings should be pursued and what factors were considered when

        making decisions around this. Again, decisions as to whether enforcement

        proceedings should be pursued were made by a different department and

        therefore I am unable to comment on this.



     75. 1 have also been asked about the process that was followed by the

        Financial Investigation Unit and what part the CLT played in this process in

        criminal enforcement proceedings. In answering this question, I have

        reviewed the Financial Investigation Unit process documentation

        (P0L00084988 and P0L00084989).



     76. My understanding is that when a sub postmaster was found guilty,

        repayment directions were given by the Court. Counsel would forward these


                                     Page 26 of 89
                                                                                   W ITNO4750100
                                                                                WITNO4750100




    to CLT who would make sure that they were complied with by the Defence.

    If enforcement proceedings were needed because the directions were not

    complied with, the Investigation and Security Team would approach us and

    we would make the appropriate application the Court. To clarify, this was

    before the separation of the businesses. When the businesses separated,

    enforcement proceedings were dealt with by CK.




77. The below deals with the following cases in turn:



     i.   R v David Blakey

    ii.   R v Suzanne Palmer

   iii.   R v Susan Rudkin

  iv.     R v Julian Wilson

   v.     R v Seema Misra

  vi.     Action against Joan Bailey

  vii.    R v Lynette Hutchings

 viii.    R v Grant Allen

  ix.     R v Angela Sefton and R v Anne Nield

   x.     R v Khayyam Ishaq



78. Before I begin, I would like to express my deepest sympathies to each and

    every sub postmaster whose case I dealt with and to confirm that I have

    read all of their Impact Statements. I took my role as a criminal prosecutor


                                  Page 27 of 89
                                                                                                    W I TNO4750100
                                                                                                   WITNO4750100




        seriously and always thought that I was following the correct course of

        action based on the information and evidence I had in front of me. To learn

        that the Horizon system was not reliable and that these sub postmasters

        were wrongly convicted is deeply saddening. In particular, I would like to

        express my deepest sympathies to Julian Wilson's wife, upon learning that

        Mr Wilson passed away before his conviction was overturned.



R -v- David Blakey



     79. To assist me in answering the Inquiry's questions in relation to this case, I

        have considered the following documents:



        i.    The Record of Tape Recorded Interview with David Blakey dated 13

              If~Fi'li►IIIii'l~Iis7[11lItL!\~f:~Etflllif:Ti\Fri\Y~7[lI1~IL!<€:~C~i~l '~;1'i►]l1l

        ii.   The summary of key points from an interview with Gillian Blakey




       iv.    The Notification of Proceedings to Police forms relating to Mr Blakey




     81. I first become involved in the case of Mr Blakey when the file was allocated

        to me by the Head of CLT. The Head of CLT would receive the file from the


                                            Page 28 of 89
                                                                                   W I TNO4750100
                                                                                 WITNO4750100




   Investigation and Security Team, review the investigation papers and

   evidence relating to the case, and allocate it to a member of the CLT which,

   in this case, was me.



82. Normally, i would get involved in a case around 2 weeks before providing

   the advice. From the documents, it appears that this would have been



   f•ZIZIL[IIR7[IIIZAL~ES~f?Ei'~]




83. Due to the passage of time, I cannot recall what papers were considered

   and were before me when I wrote this advice. However, in principle, an ideal

   file should contain the investigation report, tapes of recorded interviews,

   audit report, disclosure schedule, contract of the sub-postmaster and

   witness statements, including one giving an account of the operation of the

   Horizon system.



84. My advice was written prior to the issue of any criminal proceedings against




85. As with all cases, in giving my advice, I would apply the two-stages of the

   Full Code Test of the Code; the evidential test and the public interest test.

   My advice would be drafted from a template advice note which would give a

   list of the factors that I needed to take into consideration when applying this

   test. For example, when considering if prosecution was in the public

   interest, I would look at the period of offending, any admission and the


                                    Page 29 of 89
                                                                                  W ITNO4750100
                                                                               WITNO4750100




   amount of loss that had incurred. I also recall that the Post Office Policy was

   contained in the template advice so that I could easily run through and apply

   it.



86. My advice (POL00044835) states that, in my opinion, there is sufficient

   evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction. My assessment of the

   evidence is that there was a low prospect of securing a conviction for theft

   and a high prospect for false accounting. It notes that Mr Blakey has not

   made any admissions of theft and I therefore identify that further evidence is

   needed, in particular from staff members.



87. I cannot recall the name, but an individual within the Investigation and

   Security Team who was responsible for making the decision for

   prosecutions, would have authorised the prosecution of Mr Blakey.



88. Due to the passage of time, I cannot recall who made the charging decision

   in this case. However, it would not have been the CLT as our role did not

   involve charging the individual. Although the charges were drafted by us, it

   was for the Investigation and Security Team to make the decision as to

   whether or not they accepted the drafted charges and, ultimately issue

   summons.



89. There was no Horizon data or ARQ logs requested from Fujitsu in this case.

   However, the statement from Jane Kay (POL00044825) sets out the

   workings of the Horizon system.


                                Page 30 of 89
                                                                                 W ITN04750100
                                                                                WITNO4750100




90. I have considered the draft Schedule of Non-Sensitive Unused material

   (POL00044817). I cannot recall this document but it is likely that I would

   have reviewed it when I provided the advice. As detailed above, the

   disclosure schedule would usually be sent with the initial investigation report

   for the lawyer to review when they provided the advice.



91. Due to the passage of time, I cannot recall who the disclosure officer was in

   this case.



92. My role in relation to disclosure was initially to review the disclosure

   schedule and to confirm that all the material disclosed was relevant and that

   there were no missing documents that I was aware should be disclosed.

   The schedule would then have been sent to the Defence along with the

   evidence. As disclosure is an continuous obligation, I had an ongoing

   obligation to review disclosure throughout the case. However, cannot recall

   specifically whether any additional disclosure was disclosed in the lifetime of

   this case.



93. In respect of what witness evidence was provided in this case, I can confirm

   that I have reviewed the following:



    i.   The unsigned witness statement of Glen Morris dated 23 November

         2004 (POL00044819);




                                 Page 31 of 89
                                                                                 W ITN04750100
                                                                             WITNO4750100




   ii.   The unsigned witness statement of Paul Whitaker dated 24 November

         2004 (POL00044824);

  iii.   The unsigned witness statement of Jayne Kaye dated 18 November

         2004 (POL00044825);

  iv.    The unsigned witness statement of Natasha Beck dated 18 November

         2004 (POL00044826);

   v.    The unsigned witness statement of Patricia Brown dated 15 November

         2004 (POL00044827);

  vi.    The unsigned witness statement of Samantha Callaghan dated 15




94. These witness statements were obtained to address issues including the

   fact that it was Mr Blakey who was responsible for entering the data on the

   Horizon system, the workings of the system and that no other staff had

   actually stolen money from the Post Office or falsified the Post Office

   accounts.



95. The purpose of obtaining each of these witnesses was as followed:



   I.    Glen Morris (POL00044819) provided evidence in relation to the audit

         he carried out which proved that there was a shortage of cash at Mrs

         Blakey's Post Office.

   ii.   Paul Whittaker (POL00044824) was the Investigation Officer who

         carried out an interview under caution of both Mr and Mrs Blakey and

         provided evidence in relation to the same.


                                 Page 32 of 89
                                                                                W I TN04750100
                                                                               WITNO4750100




  iii.   Jane Kay (POL00044825) was a retail manager at a Post Office store

         and gave evidence as to how the Horizon system worked.

  iv.    Natasha Beck (POL00044826) was a Post Office Clerk and gave

         evidence as to her role at a sub Post Office.

   v.    Samantha Callaghan (POL00044828) was a member of staff at Riby

         Square in Grimsby and gave evidence confirming that it was Mr Blakey

         who would enter the information on the Horizon system.



96. In reflecting on the way that the investigation and prosecution was

   conducted by the Post Office and the outcome of the case, I have reviewed

   the following documents as provided by the Inquiry:




         ~1i7[I1Z   K1W

   ii.   The judgment of the Court of Appeal in Josephine Hamilton & Others v

         Post Office Limited [2021] EWCA Crim 577 (POL00113278) (in

         particular, paragraphs 347 to 352)



97. It is apparent that the Court of Appeal have accepted that Mr Blakey was

   wrongly convicted and for that, I can only apologise and express my

   sympathies. Had I become aware of any information/evidence or had

   knowledge, at any stage of the prosecution case, that the prosecution

   should not continue, I would have flagged this and advised POL and the

   Court to discontinue and offer no evidence in respect of the charges faced

   by Mr Blakey.

                                                                                  W ITNO4750100
                                                                                WITNO4750100




 98. The judgment of Josephine Hamilton and Others v Post Office Limited

    [2021] (POL000113278), paragraphs 347 --- 352 note the case of Mr Blakey.

    In particular, paragraph 351 notes:



    "POL accepts that this was an unexplained shortfall case and that evidence

    from Horizon was essential to Mr Blakey's case- There is nothing to indicate

    that any ARQ data was obtained at the time of the criminal proceedings.

    There was no evidence to corroborate the Horizon evidence. There was no

    investigation into Horizon reliability. There was no proof of an actual loss as

    opposed to a Horizon-generated shortfall-"



 99. From my recollection and from reviewing the documents, the workings of

    the Horizon system were never raised as an issue and ARQ data was never

    requested by the Defence. I cannot comment on any investigation as this

    would have been carried out by the Investigation and Security Team, prior

    to me receiving the file.



100. Mr Blakey was represented by solicitors and Counsel who were entitled to

    request any evidence that they needed to support his defence. In addition,

    the Defence are able to make a Section 8 application under the Criminal

    Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 for disclosure should his legal

    representatives have thought that evidence was being withheld from him. Mr

    Blakey pleaded guilty and no such a request was made.

   101. As with all cases, I was shocked when I heard of the Court of Appeal

        judgement and my full sympathy goes out to Mr Blakey for all the loss and

        distress that he suffered.



R -v- Suzanne Palmer



   102. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the case of

        Suzanne Palmer. To assist me in answering the Inquiry's questions on this

        case, I have reviewed the following documents:



         i.   The Record of Tape Recorded Interview of Suzanne Palmer on 6

              February 2006 (POL00053009);

        ii.   The Investigation Report by Lisa Allen dated 20 February 2006

103. I first became involved in the case of Mrs Palmer when I received the file for

      it. Again, I cannot recall exactly when this was but it is likely to have been a




104. I can also not remember what information I was provided with prior to writing

     this advice but please see above in relation to Mr Blakey as to what an ideal

     file should contain.



105. My advice states that I was of the opinion that there was sufficient evidence

     to afford a realistic prospect of conviction of Mrs Palmer for the offences of

     false accounting. I also advise on what additional evidence/statements may

     I -      CJ

106. As confirmed with the case of Mr Blakey, I would have considered both the

    evidential and public interest test from the Full Code Test when drafting my

    advice. Please see my answer above to Mr Blakey as to what this would

     have involved.



107. I cannot recall my reasoning at the time, but having reviewed my advice, it

    appears that my reasoning for prosecution and recommendation for the

    Crown Court was based on the seriousness of the offence and the high

    deficiency in the account. In considering whether it was in the public interest

    to prosecute, I would also have taken into account the fact that Mrs Palmer

    was in a position of trust and the losses related to public money.



108. The Investigation Report by Lisa Allen dated 20 February 2006

    (POL00053007) confirms that Tony Utting was the designated prosecution

    authority in Mrs Palmer's case. Therefore, I understand that it would have

     been him who authorised her prosecution. In terms of the charges, we (the

    legal team) would draft the charges and Tony Utting would approve them.



109. No Horizon data was requested in this case.



110. I can confirm that I have considered the following documents:



         The memo from Jennifer Andrews to the Investigations Team dated 11

         October 2006 (POL00052992);

           November 2006 (POL00052988);

           January 2007 (POL00052995);

    v.     My memo to the Investigation Team dated 23 January 2007

           (POL00053000).



111. 1 cannot recall who the disclosure officer was in this case.



112. In terms of my role in relation to disclosure in these proceedings, they were

     the same as above in relation to Mr Blakey.



113. In reflecting on the way that the investigation and prosecution of Mrs Palmer

     was conducted and the subsequent outcome of this case, I have reviewed




      i.   The memo from Jennifer Andrews to the Investigation Team dated 31

           January 2007 (POL00052982);

     ii.   The Casework Management initial Tick List for the Palmer case

114. Mrs Palmer was found Not Guilty by the jury. However, I appreciate that she

    still suffered loss and distress from the incorrect accusations from the Post

    Office and my full sympathies are extended to her.




115. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the case of Susan

     Rudkin. To assist me in answering the Inquiry's questions on this case, I

    have considered the following documents:



     i.    Letter from Mr Rudkin to Paul Hemley dated 14 January 2004

116. I have reviewed the Incident Report from 2004 (POL00065265) which

    confirms that an error had been identified in Giro bank withdrawals of

    £48.96 being erroneously entered twice. I have no specific recollection of

    `phantom' banking transactions being reported by Miss Rudkin at the branch

    in January 2005 and there is no mention of it in my memo to the Fraud

    Team dated 3 October 2008 (POL00046488).



117. I have considered the following documents:

    v.     The memo from Mike Wilcox to me dated 29 January 2009




   vii.    The Summons dated 12 February 2009 (POL00046537).



118. i first became involved in the case of Susan Rudkin when I received the

     `green file', after it was allocated by the Head of Cl T. As with the other

     cases, this would have been a couple of weeks before my report, so roughly




119. Following my review of the file, I reported back to the Fraud Team by way of

     a memo dated 3 October 2008 (POL00046488). I cannot recall , and the

     documents do not assist me in recalling, what information/evidence I

     considered prior to writing my advice memo on 3 October 2008. However,

     please refer to my comments in respect of Mr Blakey as to what an ideal file

     should contain.



120. As confirmed with the case of Mr Blakey and Mrs Palmer, I would have

     considered both the evidential and public interest test as required by the

     Code when drafting my advice.




                                  Page 40 of 89
                                                                                    W I TN04750100

121. I cannot recall my reasoning, but based on the memo, my advice states that

    the evidence is sufficient to afford a realistic prospect of conviction. My

    advice confirms that although I have recommended a charge for the offence

    of theft, the case may also be considered for false accounting charges at a

    later stage. I have also recommended what further evidence l witness

    statements are required.



122. 1 cannot recall who authorised the prosecution of Mrs Rudkin, although it is

    likely that it would have been somebody senior to Mike Wilcox, Investigation

    Officer. I also cannot recall who made the charging decision in this case.



123. No Horizon data was requested in this case.



124. I can confirm that I have considered the following documents:




    ii.   The letters from Mr Rudkin dated 25 February 2009 (POL00044916)




125. I have been asked what, if any, impact Mr Rudkin's letters had on decisions

     relating to the prosecution of Mrs Rudkin. I do not recall having seen them

    or having had any knowledge of them at the time of prosecution and I note

    that they post-date the prosecution decision. Had I received them at the

    time, I would have reviewed them in light of the public interest test. 1 cannot

    say now whether I would have considered this correspondence alone, in the


                                 Page 41 of 89

    absence of medical evidence, to have caused me to reach a different view,

     but I certainly would have raised this with Counsel and the Investigation and

    Security Team for their consideration.



126. I have considered the letter from Richard Nelson solicitors to Mike Wilcox

     dated 7 April 2009 (POL00046524). This confirms that Mrs Rudkin is

     declining to attend Loughborough Police Station on a voluntary basis and

     encloses a copy of a letter from Dr A T Peded dated 22 February 2009,

    which confirms that she is not fit to be interviewed (POL00050993) due to

     her poor mental health. I cannot remember being aware of the extent of Mrs

     Rudkin's poor mental health. From the documentation, the only information

     relating to her health was contained in the memo from Mike Wilcox to me

     (POL00046505) which states '?have since been in contact with Richard

     Nelson solicitors.. . who have notified me that Mrs Rudkin does not wish to

    attend a further interview as they have concerns over her deteriorating

     mental health." If I had had sight of Mrs Rudkin's doctor's letter

     (POL00050993), I would have certainly considered it and raised with the

     Investigation and Security Team for their consideration.



127. I can confirm that I have considered the letter to Richard Nelson solicitors

     dated 19 February 2009 (POL00050990). I cannot recall who the disclosure

     officer was in this case.



128. My role in relation to disclosure in these proceedings was the same as

     described above in relation to Mr Blakey.

129. In terms of what criminal enforcement proceedings were taken against Mrs

    Rudkin and what my involvement was in these proceedings, I have had to

    refresh my memory with the documents that the Inquiry provided me with

    (detailed in the following paragraphs). A summary of the events of the case

    are detailed in the Financial Investigation Log (POL00057602).



130. Document POL00050242 is a Restraint Order to prevent the disposal of

    assets. This would have been done at the outset of prosecution by the

    Financial Investigation accredited officers, not the CLT.



131. Document POL00051380 is a memo from Rob Wilson to the Fraud Team

    dated 6 May 2009, which confirms that Mrs Rudkin was charged with

    stealing £43,894.15 belonging to Post Office Limited, contrary to Section

    1(1) of the Theft Act 1968, for which she was sentenced to 12 months

    imprisonment suspended for 2 years with a Community Order of 300 unpaid

    work and electronically monitored curfew for 6 months requiring her to stay

    indoors between the hours of 10pm and 5am.



132. On 8 July 2009 I sent a letter enclosing the Prosecution Statement under

    Section 16 together with supporting documents to the Defence

    (POL00052029).



133. On 24 July 2009, Counsel were briefed to attend the Confiscation Hearing

    at Stratford Crown Court on 21 August 2009 (POL00052094).

                                                                                    WITNO4750100




134. On 12 August 2010 I received a letter (POL0055156). This lays out the

     financial circumstances and difficulties of Mr and Mrs Rudkin and ultimately

     asks me to consider whether a variation on the basis of inadequacy would

     be a suitable way forward. Upon receipt of this letter, I passed it on to the

     Financial Investigation Department to consider and for their further

     instructions. It would not have been a matter for me to decide. I cannot

     recall the response of the Financial Investigation Department. I would also

     have forwarded it onto Counsel l the agents for their information.



135. Document POL00055203 is a letter written from me on 31 August 2010

     which confirms that a further hearing for a Confiscation Order will be heard

     at Birmingham Magistrates Court on 30 November 2010.



136. Document POL00057602 gives a summary of the case. This a document

     created for internal administrative purposes and I had no input into it.



137. I can recall very little about this case, as I did not carry out the investigation

     of Mrs Rudkin, or attend her Court hearing. I have therefore relied heavily

     upon the documents provided to me by the Inquiry. From reviewing the

     documents, it appears that the prosecution case itself was relatively

     straightforward and concluded by way of an early guilty plea with the Court

     imposing a sentence. However, as with the other subpostmasters who were

     wrongly convicted, I extend my sympathies to Mrs Rudkin for her wrongful

     conviction and in particular, the effect that this had on her mental health.

138. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the case against

    the late Julian Wilson.



139. To assist me in answering the Inquiry's questions on this case, I have

    considered the following documents:



     i.   The Record of Tape Recorded Interview dated 15 September 2008

          (POL00050140 (part 1) and POL.00050128 (part 2));

    ii.   My memo to the Fraud Team dated 6 January 2009 (POL00044806);

    v.    My letter to Mr Wilson's solicitors dated 2 April 2009 (POL00051265).



140. I cannot recall exactly when I became involved in this case. My memo

     "•   /11.x:1'.     r.'-..             1i•    a '    -         •   ..

    Christmas and New Year, I would have likely become first involved around




141. Again, I cannot recall, and the documents do not assist me in recalling, what

    information/evidence I considered prior to writing this advice memo.

     However, as with the other cases, please see my comments in relation to

     Mr Blakey as to what an ideal file would contain.


                                 Page 45 of 89
                                                                                      W I TN04750100
                                                                                 WITNO4750100




142. I advised the Investigation and Security Team that there was sufficient

    evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction for the offences of theft

    and false accounting. I advised that if the Defendant offered a guilty plea to

    false accounting then it is advisable that the prosecution should accept this

     plea and not proceed with the theft charge. The memo confirms that this

    advice is in view of Mr Wilson's admissions to false accounting in interview

     under caution and denial of theft.



143. As with all cases, when drafting this advice, I would have considered the full

    code tests as required by the Code, including whether it was in the public

     interest to prosecute Mr Wilson.



144. I cannot recall who authorised the prosecution of Mr Wilson. I assume that

     the Team Leader within the Investigations Team or else a designated

    decision maker within the Investigation and Security Team would have done

    so. It would not have been the Investigation Officer.



145. Similarly, I cannot recall the name, but the decision maker would have




146. No Horizon data was requested from Fujitsu in this case. However, in my

    advice note to Counsel dated 22 May 2009 (POL00044751) it notes that I

     have requested further witness statements, including a statement

    addressing the !T system.

147. I can confirm that I have considered the following documents:



      i.   The Schedule of Non-Sensitive Unused Material dated 18 March 2009

           (POL00051194);

     ii.   The memo from Rob Wilson to me dated 6 May 2009 (POL00051385);

    iii.   The draft Brief to Counsel dated May 2009 (POL00044753);

    iv.    The Summary of Facts (POL00044767);

     v.    The letter from Richard Nelson Solicitors dated 14 May 2009, with

           handwritten comments (POL00051920);

    vi.    My letter to Richard Nelson Solicitors dated 19 May 2009

           (UKG100012555);

   vii.    Counsel's Advice dated 22 May 2009 (POL00044751) and the draft

           Case Summary (POL00044809);

   viii.   My memo to the Fraud Team dated 28 May 2009 (POL00051720);

    ix.    My letter to Mr Wilson's solicitors dated 28 May 2009 (POL00051715);

     x.    The Hearsay Notice (POL00047026) (page 2 onwards).



148. My role in relation to disclosure in these proceedings was the same as

     detailed above in the case of Mr Blakey.



149. The information that was requested by Mr Wilson's solicitors is contained in

     their letter of 14 May 2009 (POL00051920). This requests a draft indictment

     and a schedule of unused material. It also notes that there are a number of




                                  Page 47 of 89

                                                                                   WITNO4750100




     to that of Mr Wilson's and asks for the details of the number of prosecutions

     that are currently ongoing and details as to the geographic location of such

     prosecutions.



150. I cannot recall whether I considered the request by the time I wrote to Mr

     Wilson's solicitors on 19 May 2009 but it is likely that I did as it encloses one

     of the requested items; the schedule of unused material. Furthermore, three

     days after writing this letter, Counsel write an advice note (POL0004751)

     referring to the request on 14 May 2009 at paragraph 7. It is likely that I

     would have sent them this information a few days prior to writing the advice

     note, which means I would have also considered it a few days prior to

     receiving the advice note.



151. Following Counsel's advice, I forwarded the same to the Investigation and

     Security Team and asked them to make further enquiries and deal with the

     matters set out in it (POL00051720).



152. I have considered the following documents:



      i.   Counsel's Brief endorsed following the hearing on 15 June 2009

           (POL00051459);

     ii.   Counsel's endorsed copy of the Indictment (POL00044800);

    iii.   John H. Dove's letter to me dated 17 June 2009 (POL00051936).

153. Based on these documents, there does not appear to have been any further

    disclosure provided to the Defence following receipt of Counsel's advice

    before the Plea and Case Management Conference on 15 June 2009

    although it is not clear and I cannot specifically recall .



154. John Dove's letter dated 17 June 2009 (POL00051936) summarises what



    ~~r   '~L~S

    acceptable compromise to avoid a trial. A deal was subsequently struck

    whereby Mr Wilson would plead guilty on a basis of plea of an acceptance

    of the false accounting in the years 2007 and 2008, but for the full amount

    of the shortfall of £27,811.98. On arraignment, Mr Wilson pleaded Not Guilty

    to Counts 1, 2 and 3 but Guilty to Counts 4 and 5. These pleas were

    accepted and Counts 1, 2 and 3 were dismissed.



155. Document POL000119134 is a memo, confirming that in the Sentencing

    Hearing, Mr Wilson was sentenced to 200 hours of community order on

    account of both counts. He was also ordered to pay prosecution costs and a

    Confiscation timetable was set.



156. In relation to what criminal enforcement proceedings were taken against

    Julian Wilson and what my involvement was in these proceedings, I have

157. These documents confirm that Mr Wilson was subject to a Restraint Order.

     The same as with Mrs Rudkin, this was dealt with by the Financial

     Investigation accredited officers, not the CLT.



158. Mr Wilson was also ordered to provide, and serve, financial information and

     document POL00052047 confirms that I forwarded details of a registration

     of a charge on Mr and Mrs Wilson's re-mortgage of their property to the

     Fraud Team. I am unable to comment on Mr Wilson's criminal proceedings

    beyond what is contained in these documents, but document POL00044749

    provides a Financial Investigation Events Log which provides an overview of

    the case, including what aspects I was involved in.



159. The memo of Jenny Andrew of 11 January 2010 (POL00119126) confirms

    that Mr Wilson agreed to pay £28,434.95 within 6 months of the hearing i.e.

    before 17 June 2010. A Compensation Order was also made for this

    amount. My memo (POL001 19206) confirms that the Order was postponed

    by 6 months, giving a maximum statutory period of 12 months.



160. The Inquiry have directed me to the judgment of Josephine Hamilton and

    Others v Post Office Limited [2021] EWCA Crim 577 (POL00113278),

    paragraphs 175 — 178. In particular, I have noted that paragraph 177 states:



    "POL accepts that this was an unexplained shortfall case and that evidence

    from Horizon was essential to Mr Wilson's case. Based on the papers

    available from the criminal proceedings, there is nothing to suggest any

    ARQ data was obtained. POL did not investigate any of the criticisms of

    Horizon made by Mr Wilson historically and during his detailed interview_

     There was no evidence to corroborate the Horizon evidence. There was no

    proof of an actual loss as opposed to a Horizon-generated shortage."



161. From the documents, it appears that the request for further disclosure was

    taken seriously with the relevant information requested, but I acknowledge

    that this was not available at the time of the Plea and Case Management

        Hearing. The case was not adjourned but instead, a basis of plea was

        agreed meaning the case was concluded prior to any further disclosure

        being obtained and disclosed which may have been relevant to the outcome

        of this case. l cannot comment on the investigation process as this was

        conducted by the Investigation and Security Team of which I was not

        involved.



   162. 1 am saddened that Mr Wilson did not learn of his conviction being

        overturned prior to him passing and extend my sympathies to his family for

        the distress and loss that the conviction had upon them and Mr Wilson.

     listed below which I can confirm that I have reviewed:



      i.   The correspondence involving Fujitsu legal (FUJ00152928,

           FUJ00152935, FUJ00152936, F1JJ00152937, FUJ00152938,

  xiv.    My email dated 1 July 2013 (FUJ00154223).



165. As with the other cases, my involvement with the case of Mrs Misra started

     on receipt of the file, which would have been roughly two weeks before my

     advice memo dated 1 April 2008 (POL00049658). Therefore, it is likely that

     my involvement would have started around mid-March.



166. As with the other cases, I cannot recall what information I received prior to

     giving this advice but refer the Inquiry to my comments in relation to Mr

     Blakey as to what an ideal file should contain. I cannot remember and am

     therefore unable to confirm whether or not any of the documents at

     POL00094011 formed part of the information that I received.



167. The advice that I gave to the Investigation and Security Team is laid out in

     my memo of I April 2008 (POL00049658). This states that in my opinion,

     there is sufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction for the

     charges. It notes that I have recommended a charge of theft of £74,609.84

     in view of the fact the losses were accrued for a period of over a year. I also

    suggested a charge of false accounting. I recommend that if Mrs Misra

     pleaded Guilty to the false accounting than the prosecution in respect of the

     theft is not proceeded with. I recommend that all relevant accounts and

     documentation should be produced in full. My advice then lists further

    statements which I think are needed.

168. As with the other cases, my advice was based upon consideration and

    application of the Code, including whether the prosecution of Mrs Misra was

    in the public interest.



169. I believe that it was David Pardoe who authorised the prosecution of Ms

    Misra. David Pardoe also made the charging decision in this case.



170. As to whether there was any disagreement between individuals within the

     Investigation and Security Team or between me and the Investigation and

    Security Team as to what the appropriate charges were, I can see from the

    correspondence (POL._00049716) that I have been asked whether I will be

    changing my advice on the charges, to which I respond "No. Please

    proceed as advised_" The final charges were always a subject of discussion

    between teams and I cannot remember there being any specific

    disagreement over the charges for Mrs Misra.



171. 1 cannot recall being aware of any allegations made by Mrs Misra relating to

    the reliability of the Horizon IT system when I advised the Investigation and

    Security Team in April and November 2008. However, I have noted that

    neither the Audit Report (POL00058550), nor the Investigation Report

    (POL00044541) make reference to any issues with the Horizon IT system,

    with the Investigation Report noting that Ms Misra attributes the losses to

    staff theft. I believe that the issue was raised just before trial, causing an

    adjournment of the trial.

172. 1 have considered the letter dated 13 May 2009 (POL00051441) and the

     emails dated 22 May 2009 (POL00051539). The letter of 13 May 2009

     notes that Mrs Misra has indicated that she will plead Guilty to False

     Accounting and Not Guilty to Theft. It requests Counsel's advice as to

     whether we should proceed on the account of theft as we have been unable

     to locate the three employees who could speak to the count. Counsel's

     subsequent email of 22 May 2009 advises that there is strong evidence to

     proceed with the theft charge and we should not accept the plea. I recall

     that it was felt that it would not be possible to pursue a Confiscation Order

     without a theft conviction. Counsel also notes that the Defendant may have

     given false details in relation to the whereabouts of the employees.



173. In addition to the memo of 1 April 2008 (POL00049658), I have considered

     the following documents:



     i.    The list of statements and evidence sent to me on 23 January 2009

           (POL00050738);

           evidence and brief for the Prosecution dated February 2009

           (POL00044585) and the letter to Counsel's clerk dated 17 February

   vii.   The letter from the Castle Partnership dated 2 March 2009

          (POL00051045).



174. I cannot recall who the disclosure officer was in this case.



175. My role in relation to disclosure is the same as described in relation to Mr




176. I would have reviewed everything handed to me, including the Schedule of

     Non-Sensitive Unused Material dated 23 January 2009 and would have

     considered my disclosure obligations at every stage of the proceedings as

     part of my continuous duty.



177. Counsel would have advised on disclosure in response to my instructions in

     February 2009. However, without the documents I cannot recall what this




178. I have considered the attendance note dated 3 June 2009 (POL00051773).

     The Inquiry have asked me to explain the circumstances in which the

     challenge to the integrity of the Horizon IT system first arose in this case.

     From my recollection, the challenge arose at trial and the defence material

     only consisted of computer magazine articles describing issues with


                                   Page 57 of 89
                                                                                       W ITNO4750100
                                                                                  WITNO4750100




     Horizon, although I do not recall being given a copy. The case was

     therefore adjourned and directions were made for the Defence to take steps

     to set out and instruct an expert. The case was then listed for a mention

     hearing.



179. I have considered the email chain from August 2009 (POL00052202). It

     appears that the email was sent to me on 4 August 2009 but then forwarded

     to Phil Taylor on 11 August 2009 and so it is not clear what involvement I

     had with this. The email within this chain from David Posnett on 4 August

     2009 at 09:38 outlines the issues with obtaining the ARQ log showing

     transaction data for the relevant period. It states that due to the size of the

     ARQ request, he cannot authorise Fujitsu to proceed at this stage. The

     email notes that the request from the Defence equates to approximately 31

     ARQs and they have an annual allowance of 670 ARQs so the request

     represents a large chunk of their quota. It also notes that they can only

     request 60 ARQs a month, so the Defence request could be detrimental to

     other Prosecution requests.



180. I confirm that I have considered the following documents:



     i.    The letter from Coomber Rich dated 1 October 2009 (POL00052487)

           and the enclosed application for disclosure (POL00052462) and further

     Post Office's response to those requests.



182. With reference to POL00053723, my view in December 2009 was that the

     disclosure request which had been made by the Defence was very wide, not

     focused and their relevance was not clear as this was not properly set out in

     disclosure request. I can recall that I sought Counsel's input at this stage

     and John Longman and Phil Taylor were also heavily involved. I believe that

     Counsel advised as to what the parameters of the request should be and




184. The Defence's expert report raised a number of issues/question and in

     order to respond, as stated above, I spoke to the Head of Legal at Fujitsu.

     Fujitsu put forward Gareth Jenkins as the best person to assist and I

     understand that he met with the Defence expert and also responded to the

    Defence expert's report and email requests. He also gave evidence in Court

    and was cross-examined by the Defence.



185. Document POL00044557 is the advice given by Counsel in January 2010

    on the disclosure requests made by the Defence. The advice notes that

    although we have been put on notice that the Defence are challenging the

    reliability of Horizon, this has been done in very general terms, with no

    Defence Statement served mentioning this issue. The advice states that our

    response to the disclosure requests should raise this failing and request a

    detailed Defence Case Statement which fully particularises any problems

    with Horizon which are alleged and upon which the Defence will seek to rely

    upon at trial. The advice note then goes through each disclosure request in

    turn.



186. Juliet MacFarlane's raises a concern about paragraph 23 of Counsel's

    Advice in her letter dated 2 February 2010 (POL00053954). Paragraph 23

    of Counsel's Advice (POL00044557) notes that there is a Brief in the case

    of Hosi which should be disclosed. From recollection, the case of Hosi was

    one of Juliet MacFarlane's cases. Her concerns appear to arise from the

    fact the case was ongoing and therefore there was no determination of the

    evidence and the expert evidence was in draft format.



187. Document POL00053849 is an attendance note which discusses disclosure

    and confirms that Counsel have advised we should disclose everything we

    can disclose at this stage. I cannot remember whether the report in the case


                                 Page 61 of 89
                                                                                     W ITN04750100
                                                                                  WITNO4750100




    of Hosi was disclosed. However, it looks like it was not. I understand in

    January 2010 that there was still an issue with how wide the Defence

     Request was but there was a willingness to disclose and work was ongoing

     by Investigation Officer, John Longman, to process the request.



188. Beyond what is detailed in the documents listed above, I am not in a

     position to comment, as I cannot recall, whether Counsel advised on the

    further requests for disclosure made by the Defence after January 2010 as I

    cannot remember.



189. Similarly, I am not in a position to comment on the position taken by the

     Post Office in relation to the Defence disclosure requests insofar as they

     related to data from the Horizon IT system or information about the Horizon

     IT system. From my perspective, I believed that the Post Office understood

    that in its capacity; as a Prosecuting Authority, it had responsibilities relating

    to disclosure. From the perspective of the legal team, all cases were kept

     under review, including the ongoing disclosure obligations.



190. 1 have considered the email from Issy Hogg dated 1 March 2010

    (POL00054248), the notification of fixture dated 2 March 2010

    (POL00054275), the email from Warwick Tatford dated 8 March 2010 and

    the draft skeleton argument (POL00054335 and POL00054346) and the

    emails dated 11 and 16 March 2010 (POL00054430).

191. I can recall reading the Defence argument but due to the passage of time, I

     cannot recall what the arguments were in specific terms and do not feel that

     I am able to add anything beyond what is contained in these documents.



192. In relation to the transcripts from 11 and 18 October 2010 (UKG100014994

     and UKG100014845), there was a half-time submission and a pre-trial

     submission. On both occasions, the Judge ruled that the case could be put

     before the jury. The submissions are as per the two transcripts and again, I

     do not feel that I am able to add anything beyond what is contained in these

     documents.

     confirm that i have considered the following documents:

194. Penny Thomas worked for Fujitsu and, I understand, was the POL contact

      for Fujitsu. She came to be involved in the proceedings when the


                                 Page 65 of 89
                                                                                    W ITNO4750100
                                                                                  WITN04750100




     Investigation Officer requested information from Fujitsu in order to respond

    to the Defence expert report.



195. Penny Thomas said that we needed to follow the usual procedures for a

    data request. I was conscious that this was a very slow procedure and so to

    speed things up, I contacted Penny Thomas and she gave me the number

    of David Jones, Head of Legal at Fujitsu. I explained the situation to him

    and he identified Gareth Jenkins as an individual who had the appropriate

     knowledge and experience to assist.



196. In normal circumstances, expert witnesses should be independent. I recall

    that the input of an independent expert was considered but no suitable

    expert was identified as nobody from outside of Fujitsu had suitable

     knowledge of the Horizon system. As I have stated above, given that the

     Horizon IT system was unique I felt that the questions from the Defence

    should be answered by somebody who knew the system well. At all times,

    the main consideration was which evidence would best assist the Court in

    determining the issues in dispute. Mr Jenkins was originally brought in as a

    witness of fact, who had in-depth knowledge of the system and was

    therefore in a position to assist the Court in relation to the matters within his

     knowledge. I recall that the Court effectively treated him as an expert

    witness due to his qualifications, knowledge and experience of the system.



197. I never gave Mr Jenkins any formal instructions but I liaised with him on

    certain issues to clarify points and to forward him information. It was John


                                  Page 66 of 89
                                                                                     W ITN04750100
                                                                                    WITNO4750100




     Longman, the Investigation Officer, who would ordinarily seek Mr Jenkins'

     input in relation to issues raised by the Defence.



198. Initially, I did not consider Mr Jenkins to be acting as an expert but to be

     brought in as a lay witness with technical knowledge who could respond to

     matters raised by the Defence expert. I do not know what information was

     given to Mr Jenkins as to his role as an expert or his duty to the Court. In

     normal circumstances, when instructing an expert, I would provide this

     information. However, this was an unusual case in that he was not regarded

     by the prosecution as an expert witness but from recollection went on to be

     treated as an expert by the court. I cannot recall who told him what his role

     as an expert was but I believe that this may have been done by Counsel.



199. No explanation was given to me by anyone from Fujitsu or the Post Office

     during the case of Mrs Misra of the position in relation to known bugs, errors

     or defects in the Horizon IT system, past or current.



200. I had limited contact with Mr Jenkins and am not in a position to comment

     on any views that he expressed in relation to the disclosure being sought by

     the Defence and the relevance of the material sought to the case. His main

     point of contact was John Longman.



201. In respect of the email from David Jones to Roger Williams and David

     Roberts dated 5 February 2010 (FUJ00122723), I was not aware at the time

     that I was involved in Mrs Misra's case that Fujitsu had concerns about the


                                  Page 67 of 89
                                                                                   W ITN04750100
                                                                                 WITNO4750100




    impact that "key issues about [Fujitsu's] systems" might have on "relations

    with POL if mishandled". Had I known about this email or its content, I would

    have wanted to know what the issues were. As a lawyer my main duty is to

    the Court.



202. I do not think that any of the comments made by Mr Jenkins in his email

    dated 1 March 2010 (POL00054250) were any different to the concerns

    previously raised about the need for specific issues to be particularised by

    the prosecution. Therefore, these comments did not have any influence on

    me.



203. In relation to the requests for access made by the Defence on 22 July 2010

    (UKG100014898), I believe that this issue related to a separate incident

    being reported and that the prosecution wished to adduce evidence in

    relation to this. I recall that there was concern regarding the relevance of an

    issue in a different branch being operated by different personnel to Mrs

    Misra's case. The request from the Defence was seen as too vague and, as

    noted in my memo of 11 August 2010 (POL00055146), I state that we will

    not provide this information and if the Defence wish to proceed with their




204. 1 have considered the document entitled "Correcting Accounts for "lost"

    Discrepancies" starting at page 6 of POL00028838. I do not recall having

    seen this document before the Inquiry provided it to me. If I had known

    about this document, I would have passed it to the Investigation and

                                                                                 WITNO4750100




    Security Team to try and understand what it meant, the implications of it and

    whether the problem was being resolved. Once it had been assessed, I

    would have considered the disclosure test and disclosed it.



205. I have considered the email from Mandy Talbot to me dated 8 October 2010

    (POL00055418). I do not recall any conversations with Mandy Talbot,

    although there may have been a brief call immediately prior to her sending

    this email. I was not involved in any wider briefings and, at the time, I did not

    know who Mike' or Rod' were who are referred to in the email.



206. I have considered my email dated 21 October 2010 (POL00055590) and my

    memo to Post Office Security and others dated 16 November 2010

    (POL00055759). At the time, I thought that the outcome of the case was a

    success and I was relieved that the case was concluded.



207. There is a comment in my email that "it is hoped the case will set a marker

    to dissuade other Defendants from jumping on the Horizon bashing

    bandwagon". I was asked to report back to the team and in doing so, I

    commented on the outcome and the fact that the Defence's criticisms of the

    Horizon IT system were dealt with and that the prosecution case was made

    out. I was aware that the case was of wider interest within the business and

    my comment in relation to other cases was made with this in mind. The

208. 1 have considered the Draft Order (POL00045051) and the telephone note

    dated 22 February 2012 (POL00094048). My role in relation to criminal

    enforcement proceedings against Mrs Misra was limited. I provided the

    Directions to the Accredited Financial Investigation Team for the

    confiscation proceedings. I would have also briefed Counsel on the case if

    required but cannot recall whether or not I did. As can be seen from my

    memo (POL00119318), I attended the Confiscation Hearing and reported

    back on it.



209. My understanding of the issues and outcome in the Lee Castleton case did

    not have any impact upon my assessment of Mrs Misra's case, on the basis

    that the evidence from Mr Jenkins dealt with the issue and he had explained

    to the Court why the outcome in the Lee Castleton case was irrelevant to

    the issues in Mrs Misra's case.



210. 1 have read the judgment of Josephine Hamilton and Others v Post Office

    Limited [2021] (POL000113278), paragraphs 75, 91 and 198 to 209 and I

    hope that I have answered the criticisms highlighted in this judgment in the

    above.



211. In terms of my reflections now on the way that the investigation and

    prosecution of Mrs Misra was conducted, I wish that the wrongful conviction

    had not occurred but, at the time, I felt that the case was conducted

    professionally based on the knowledge and information before us. I would

         like to extend my sympathies to Mrs Misra for the loss and distress that she

         suffered due to the wrongful conviction.



Action against Joan Bailey



   212. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the action taken

         against Joan Bailey. To assist me in answering the Inquiry's questions on

         this case, i have considered the following documents:



         i.    The Audit Report dated 5 2011 (POL00055918);

         ii.   The Record of Taped Interview dated 9 March 2011 (POL00056387

   213. To my knowledge, an audit, interview and investigation was done to

         establish the cause of the 'losses' which had been occurring at the branch.

                                                                                         W ITNO4750100

        My assessment of the case, based on the admissions made at interview,

        was that the appropriate offences were fraud / false accounting. Taking into

        account all of the factors in this case and applying the public interest test,

        my assessment was that a caution was appropriate. Because no other

        offences were being considered, it was not necessary as part of the legal

        process, and therefore I did not, further investigate or consider whether the

        losses in the branch might have been caused by the Horizon IT system.



   214. I do not recall whether any Horizon data (and in particular ARQ logs) were

        requested from Fujitsu in relation to this case, but it is unlikely given the

        decision to offer a caution on grounds of the admitted fraud. I do not know if

        the Investigation and Security Team, as part of any wider consideration of

        the matter, requested any information from Fujitsu.



   215. 1 have no specific recollection of this case and therefore do not feel in a

        position to provide any further reflections at this stage, other than to say that

        I am, of course, sorry that action was incorrectly taken again Joan Bailey

        and the loss and distress that this will have caused her.



R -v- Lvnette Hutchings



   216. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the case of Lynette

        Hutchings. To assist me in answering the Inquiry's questions on this case, I

        have considered the following documents:




                                      Page 72 of 89
                                                                                    W ITN04750100
                                                                                   WITNO4750100




      i.   The handwritten note (POL00046065);

     ii.   The Audit Report dated 31 March 2011 (POL00056292);

    iii.   The Record of Tape Recorded Interview dated 20 April 2011

           (POL00056417 (part 1),POL00044505 (part 2), POL00046625 (part

           3));

    iv.    The Investigation Report dated 5 May 2011 (POL00046706);

    v.     My memo dated 17 June 2011 (POL00046626);

    vi.    The memo from Graham Brander to you dated 9 December 2011

           (POL00046628);

   vii.    The Advice and Proposed Charge drafted by Martin Smith of

           Cartwright King (POL00057362).



217. I first became involved in the case of Mrs Hutchings on receipt of the file

     which, based on the date of my memo (POL00046626), would have been

     around early June 2011.



218. My initial assessment of the case and advice I gave is as per the memo

     (POL00046626). This notes that concerns were raised that the Horizon

     system was not working properly and therefore this needed to be

     investigated before final advice can be given.



219. 1 subsequently handed over the case to Martin Smith of CK, to take over.

     The advice given from CK on prosecution and charges is at document

     POL00057362. This states that there is very strong evidence to support the

     allegation that Mrs Hutchings had inflated the amount of cash held within


                                  Page 73 of 89
                                                                                    W ITN04750100
                                                                               WITNO4750100




    the branch. It notes that she admitted to altering the cash declarations and

    suggested that she had done so only since the migration to Horizon but

    prior to this, all accounts balanced. CK comment that this is clearly untrue.

    CK advise that Mrs Hutchings gave examples of problems which she

    alleged to have experienced with the Horizon system but these do not

    appear to be of any relevance and no explanation has been put forward as

    to how the deficit has arisen.



220. Following the advice, the Summons dated 21 February 2012

    (POL00057468) were issued. I assume that CK's advice was accepted by

    the Information and Security Team and that they authorised the prosecution

    based on this advice and their charging decision to prosecute on the fraud

    charge was also based on CK's advice.



221. My involvement with the matter at POL00057362 is purely administrative, in

    that I was sent a statement from Graham Brander which I subsequently

    forwarded to CK to deal with.



222. I have considered the documents provided to me by the Inquiry but, beyond

    the initial advice, I was not involved in the case and therefore I am unable to

    provide any meaningful answers to the Inquiry's questions beyond what is

    contained in the documents.



223. In reflecting on the way the investigation and prosecution of Mrs Hutchings

    was conducted by the Post Office and the outcome of the case, I have


                                 Page 74 of 89
                                                                                       W ITN04750100
                                                                                    WITNO4750100




         considered the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in Josephine Hamilton and

         Others v Post Office Limited [2012] EWCA Crim 577 (POL001 13278) (and

         in particular paragraphs 267 to 272).



   224. I understand entirely the points made in the Hamilton judgment in relation to

         there being no evidence or investigation into the Horizon IT system. At the

         time of dealing with the case I made my views clear in my advice note that

         more evidence was required to support the prosecution case. However, the

         case was subsequently taken over by CK who reviewed the evidence and

         advised on the appropriate charges. The defendant was advised by their

         Solicitor and Counsel and duly advised on their plea. I am sorry that no

         further evidence or investigation into Mrs Hutching's concerns were made

         and that this resulted her being wrongfully convicted. I extend my

         sympathies for the loss and distress that this must have caused her.



R -v- Grant Allen



   225. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the case of Grant

         Allen. To assist me in answering the Inquiry's questions on this case, I have

         considered the following documents:



         i.    The Audit Report dated 2 February 2012 (POL00089081):

         ii.   The Record of Taped Interview re. interview of 19 April 2012

               (POL00089670 (part 1), POL00089671 (part 2));

        iii.   The Investigation report dated 1 May 2012 (POL00089426);


                                      Page 75 of 89
                                                                                      W I TN04750100
                                                                                     WITNO4750100




                             "•     '1i1~'~'    "•   1i'1i 1    s "*   111'....

    v.    Gareth Jenkins' email dated 31 January 2013 (FUJ00153958).



226. At the outset I would like to flag that I had very limited involvement in the

     case as it was CK who provided and reviewed the investigation report and

     provided the initial advice.



227. My email dated 21 and 22 May 2012 (POL00089273) refers to various

     lawyers giving advice: Simon Clark, Paul Wright, Martin Smith and Chris

     Knight. I can confirm that these are CK lawyers.



228. 1 cannot now recall whether I conducted my own review of the documents

     provided by the Investigation and Security Team in this case. However, it is

     unlikely as it was the role of CK to advise the Investigation and Security




229. CK's advice is provided at POL00089057. This notes that, subject to a

     satisfactory answer in relation to the possibility of lost data, they would

     advise a charge of fraud by false representation. It notes that there is

     insufficient evidence to prove to the criminal standard who, if anyone,

     actually stole the money from the Post Office.

                                                                              WITNO4750100




230. In consideration of what action was taken by the Post Office following the

     advice from OK and what charges appeared on the final indictment, I have

     reviewed the following documents:



     i.    The Summary of Facts (POL00089562);

     ii.   The Summons dated 19 July 2012 at (POL00089072);

    iii.   The unsigned witness statement of Stephen Bradshaw dated 1 May

           2012 (POL00089560);

    iv.    The unsigned statements of Richard Cross and Andrew Wise dated 17

           September 2012 and 1 May 2012 respectively at (POL00089561);

    v.     The letter to me dated 8 August 2012 (POL00089477) and the email

           dated 9 August 2012 (POL00089329);

    vi.    The letter from Stephen Bradshaw to Cartwright King dated 24

                     "i►~IWZill7[1IiIi .T DI I I

   vii.    The list of witnesses (POL00089346) and the list of exhibits




231. Having reviewed these documents, I can see that following the advice,



     and 7 February 2012, dishonestly and intending thereby to make a gain for

     himself or another, or to expose another to a risk of loss, made

     representations to Post Office Ltd, which were and which he knew were

     untrue or misleading, namely that Winsford Post Office had more cash on

     the premises than was actually the case resulting in a shortage of £11,705,

                                                                                  WITNO4750100




    in breach of Section 2 of the Fraud Act 2006. The email dated 16 October

    2014 (POL00089050) confirms the Mr Allen subsequently pleaded guilty.



232. In relation to the Schedule of Non-Sensitive Unused Material dated 19

    September 2012 (POL00089348), the disclosure officer in this case was

    Stephen Bradshaw and CK were responsible for reviewing the disclosure

    schedules provided by Stephen as disclosure officer. I did not have any

    involvement in the disclosure process.



233. In relation to the letter from Andrew Bolc of CK to Martin Bloor of Maidments

    Solicitors dated 22 November 2012 (POL00089376), I have no recollection

    of having seen this document before the Inquiry provided it to me and I had

    no involvement in CK's response. I was not involved in, and therefore

    cannot comment on, whether any consideration was given to a stay or




234. Similarly, I do not know whether any call logs relating to calls made from Mr

    Allen's branch to the Horizon Service Desk and / or the Network Business

    Support Centre for the relevant period were ever requested.



235. 1 have considered the emails dated 16 and 19 November 2012



    nature of the report which had been prepared by Gareth Jenkins, which was



    dealt with the reliability of the Horizon system. I was not involved in any


                                 Page 78 of 89

                                                                               WITNO4750100




    correspondence between CK and Gareth Jenkins in relation to the use of

    this report. CK had care and conduct of the case and made the

    determination that the report could be used across a number of cases. From

    looking at the email chain, it appears that this was because it was a generic

    report and not specific to one particular case. There was not, as far as I am

    aware, any standard practice/process for using the same general

    report/evidence across cases.



236. As to what my understanding was of the concerns which were being raised

    by Fujitsu in this email chain (POL00089374), I can only comment on what

    is contained in the email chain. Here, it appears that the concerns were

    being raised largely in relation to the fact CK approached Mr Jenkins

    directly, when asking him whether they could use his report for multiple

    cases, as opposed to going through the usual process of contacting him

    through a member of the Investigation Team.



237. 1 can confirm that I have considered the following documents:



     i.   The emails dated 4 and 5 December 2012 (POL00089378) and 12

          December 2012 (POL00089380);

    ii.   The letter to the court from CK dated 18 December 2012

          (POL00089388), the Notice of Further Evidence dated 18 December

          2012 (POL00089063), the statement from Gareth Jenkins dated 17

          December 2012 (FUJ00124200), exhibit GIJ/1 (FUJ00080526) and

          exhibit GIJ/2 (POL00031801);

    iii.   The emails dated 5 and 19 December 2012 (POL00089390);

    iv.    The email from Gareth Jenkins dated 7 January 2013 (POL00089401);

    v.     The emails dated 31 January 2013 (POL00089427).



238. I have been asked by the Inquiry to provide an account of Fujitsu's

     involvement in these proceedings.



239. 1 was not involved in, and therefore cannot comment on, how Mr Jenkins

     came to be involved in these proceedings. However, it appears from the

     documents that his involvement stemmed from CK finding in their

     possession a report which comments on the reliability of the Horizon

     system. Given that this report was generic in nature, CK determined that it

     raised.



240. I was not involved in and therefore I did not have any say as to whether Mr

     Jenkins acted as an expert or a witness to fact. but i assume that CK would

     have wanted to have used him as an expert following the case against Mrs

     Misra. I did not give Mr Jenkins any instructions and I do not know what

     instructions he was given by CK.



241. I cannot recall whether Mr Jenkins ever conducted any analysis of the data

     specific to the case of Mr Allen. Document POL00089380 notes that Mr

     Jenkins said that he was able to retrieve the actual data from the time to see




                                  Page 80 of 89
                                                                                      W ITN04750100
                                                                                     WITNO4750100




     what actually occurred at this branch. However, I do not know whether this

     was actually completed.



242. It was for CK to decide whether Mr Jenkins should be instructed to examine

     case specific data, both in this case and more generally. i have noted my

     email of 1 February 2013 (POL00089427) where I ask whether we are in a

     position to provide Horizon data to Mr Jenkins and seek his input. I cannot

     recall the answer to this question and ultimately, it would have been a

     decision for CK.



243. No information was given to me by anyone from Fujitsu (or the Post Office)

     during the course of the criminal proceedings against Grant Allen as to any

     bugs, errors, or defects in the Horizon IT system, past or present.



244. Document POL00089427 details Mr Jenkins' concerns about the allegations

     made in the Defence. I do not feel that I am able to comment further on this,

     as I do not have any details of the allegation that he is referring to. As CK

     had conduct of the case, I would not have had these details at the time



     assumed that it would be dealt with by CK.



245. I have seen that I advise on the acceptability of the basis of plea. I do not

     know why and cannot recall why I would have got involved at this stage

     when this would have been for CK, together with the Investigation Officer, to

     consider as they would have had the background, knowledge and details of

                                                                                        WITNO4750100




        the case. I do not recall how it came for me to involved at this point. I can

        only assume that I was asked because I was the POL criminal solicitor.



   246. In reflecting now on the way the investigation and prosecution of Mr Allen

        was conducted, I have reviewed the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in

        Richard Hawkes & Others v Post Office Limited [2022] EWCA Crim 1197

        (RLIT0000039) (and in particular at paragraphs 16 to 24). This highlights

        the issues that sub postmasters were experiencing with Horizon. Had I

        known any of this information at the time, I am confident that the

        investigation and prosecution of Mr Allen, as with other sub postmasters

        would have been conducted differently, or not at all. I am sorry that the

        absence of this evidence resulted in the wrongful conviction of Mr Allen and

        the loss and distress that this must have caused him.



R -v- Angela Sefton and R -v- Anne Nield



   247. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the cases of

        Angela Sefton and Anne Nield.



   248. My involvement in these cases was very limited as CK had complete

        conduct of the prosecutions from initial advice through to conclusion. I

        therefore cannot comment on the action taken, including the charges,

        witness evidence or disclosure. I have read and reviewed the documents

        provided to me by the Inquiry in relation to these cases but do not feel I can

        add anything further than what is contained in these documents.

249. I have seen that I was sent an email from OK (POL000059313) asking me

     for an update on Insight2 (Second Sight) Report. Second Sight were

     brought in to review the prosecutions of the sub postmasters and were

     drafting a report which reviewed the Horizon system. I understand that the

     Defence solicitors were asking for this and CK's email was simply asking

     me for an update as to the report so that they could update the Defence.

     Other than this, I do not recall being involved in this case.



250. However, as with all of the cases, I understand the extent of the loss and

     distress that Ms Sefton and Ms Nield must have suffered and extend to

     them my sympathies.




251. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the case of

     Khayyam Ishaq. To assist me in answering the Inquiry's questions on this

     case. I have considered the following documents:



     i.    Martin Smith's email dated 31 May 2012 (POL001 19452);



    iii.   Rachael Panter's email dated 4 February 2013 (FUJOO153967);




                                   Page 83 of 89
                                                                                   W I TN04750100
                                                                                WITNO4750100




252. As can be seen in the above documents, as the only Criminal Lawyer at the

     POL, I was copied into this case for information only. I had no involvement

     in the actual prosecution of the case of Mr Ishaq and do not feel that I am

     able to expand on anything other than that contained in the documents.



253. However, I would like to extend my sympathy to Mr Ishaq for the loss and

     distress that he suffered due to the Horizon IT system.




254. In considering the Inquiry's questions in relation to the above subject matter,

     I can confirm that I have reviewed the following documents:

         (FUJ00152225) and 4 September 2014 (FUJ00152229);

    v.   The document entitled "Security Management Service: Service

            Description" (SVM/SDM/SD10017) dated 24 August 2006

         (FUJ00002033). 31 December 2008 (FUJ00080107), 15 October 2010

         2016 (POL00002666) (in particular paragraph 2.4).



255. My role as a member of the SLT did not include dealing with any contractual

     requirements between Fujitsu and POL. This was dealt with by a

    contract/commercial team and was not part of my responsibilities.



256. The only role I had in obtaining audit data was to request it as and when it

    was required through the Investigation and Security Team as happened in

    the case of Mrs Misra. The Investigation Officer would deal with the request

    internally and contact Fujitsu. In the case of Mrs Misra I contacted David

    Jones, Head of Legal, direct to escalate the request but it was primarily for

    the Investigation Officer to deal with requests. It was not usual for me to

    contact David Jones at Fujitsu but I did so here, due to the urgency of the

     request. I only obtained his name from Penny Thomas who provided it to

     me so that I could try to bypass the usual slow procedure for obtaining ARCS

    data.

257. In normal circumstances, I understand that David Jones in Fujitsu would be

     negotiating and communicating about ARQ requests with our contract and

    commercial team. I was not part of these negotiations and cannot comment

    on who was also responsible for the provision of data or how any data was

    obtained was presented by Fujitsu.




258. In answering the Inquiry's questions on this subject matter, I can confirm

    that I have reviewed the following documents:



     i.   Mark Dinsdale's email to Marilyn Benjamin and Juliet McFarlane dated

          2 July 2010 (F1JJ00122903);

    ii.   The emails between Juliet McFarlane and Mark Dinsdale dated 13 and

          16 September 2010 (FUJ00122980).



259. The first time that I had sight of these two emails was when the Inquiry

     provided them to me. I did not see them or have any knowledge or them

    during the time when I was involved in prosecutions of subpostmasters.

    Given that this is my first time seeing these emails, 1 do not feel in a position

    to answer the Inquiry's questions on them as I do not feel that I could

    expand on anything other than what is stated in the emails.

   261. Document POL00096983 refers to two `existing' reports called `Horizon' and

           `Horizon Online Integrity'. I cannot recall the specifics of these reports but

           presume that they were generic reports, giving information both about how

           the Horizon system operated and worked in practice and also about the

           integrity of the Horizon system. I understand that CK requested them

           because they wanted a report to be able to serve with all cases which

           assisted the Court and the Defence in understanding the working of the

           Horizon system in practical terms.



   262. I then requested another report. This was to assist Helen Rose, the

           disclosure officer, who was, at that time, dealing with 20 cases. The report

           was needed to deal with the issues in those cases. This email and the

           questions in it, were drafted following consultation with and assistance from

           CK.



   263. By this point. I did think that Mr Jenkins was providing evidence as an

           expert as he was seen as an expert by both POL and Fujitsu.



(;pnPral




   264. I did consider that a challenge to the integrity of Horizon in one case was

           relevant to other ongoing or future cases but I would also always deal with

           the specific issues in each case in front of me on a case by case basis.

                                                                                     WITN04750100




    265. Counsel were very experienced and had training on the Horizon system and

         dealt with multiple POL cases. if they were aware that an issue raised in

         one case was or could be relevant to another case, i was confident that they

         would highlight this to me in their opinions and advice.



    266. I cannot think of any other matters that I consider are of relevant to Phase 4

         of the Inquiry (Action against Sub-postmasters and others: policy making,

         audits and investigations, civil and criminal proceedings, knowledge of and

         responsibility for failures in investigation and disclosure).



    267. 1 have a lot of sympathy for these sub postmasters and the huge amount of

         loss they suffered. I genuinely thought that I was doing the right thing at the

         time. They are not criminals and I am sorry that the legal system failed them

         and treated them as such.




I believe the content of this statement to be true.
