POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF JARNAIL SINGH

|, Jarnail Singh, will say as follows:

1.

| am providing this statement following two requests for information dated 22
June 2023 and 18 August 2023, pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules
2006, regarding matters falling within Phase 4 of the Inquiry: action taken by

Post Office Ltd against Subpostmasters.

The requests contained a combined total of 224 questions, which | have
addressed below. Some of the questions are centred around cases or
subject matters to which | had limited involvement and the events of which
were over nearly 20 years ago. | have therefore found it difficult at times to
recall detailed information and have had to regularly rely on the information
contained in the documents given to me by the Post Office Horizon IT

Inquiry (“the Inquiry”) as part of the Rule 9 request. However, this statement

Page 1 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

is made to the best of my recollection and where | cannot remember

something or have had to rely on a document, | have made it clear.

3. | would also like to take this opportunity to express my sympathy to all
subpostmasters who were wrongly accused of offences due to the Horizon
IT system. As a criminal prosecutor, | always do my best with the knowledge
and evidence that | have in front of me and at the time of each sub-
postmaster case, | followed the relevant codes, policies and procedures and
genuinely thought that | was doing the right thing. | was therefore incredibly
shocked and saddened when | learnt that the subpostmasters who were

prosecuted were not at fault.

4. | can confirm that | am represented and have had legal assistance in writing
this statement. When seeking to obtain legal assistance, | was assisted by
the Post Office with the initial stage of confirming the availability of

insurance coverage, to cover the associated legal costs.

BACKGROUND

5. | have been asked to set out a summary of my career and qualifications. |

have attached a copy of my curriculum vitae, which provides these details

(WITN04750101).

WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

| was a senior lawyer in the Criminal Law Team (“CLT”) at the Royal Mail
Group Ltd (“RMG") and later at Post Office Ltd (“POL”). | joined the RMG as
a legal executive in December 1989 and then, upon qualification in around
1992, | became lawyer and was subsequently promoted to a senior lawyer
in the CLT. At RMG, | would deal with criminal prosecutions, the relevant
cases of which are given in this statement. On 1 April 2012, | was

transferred to POL.

When | transferred to POL, | was the only in-house criminal lawyer and POL
contracted all of their criminal prosecutions out to Cartwright King solicitors
(“CK”) who took over full responsibility for the lifetime of a case. At this
point, my role in relation to criminal prosecutions was limited. | would
provide input where requested and was copied into case correspondence
for information. However, in the main, | acted as a point of contact between
POL and CK and would request or forward information as and when
required. Although | would read the advice given by CK, | never made the

decision as or when to prosecute and under what charges.

| left POL around March 2015. | subsequently moved into commercial /

residential law.

POLICIES / PRACTICES IN PLACE AND THE CRIMINAL LAW TEAM’S ROLE

RELATING TO RELEVANT PROSECUTIONS

9. The below gives an account of the policies and practices in place and the

CLT’s role relating to the prosecution of subpostmasters.

10. By way of overview as to the procedure when criminal prosecutions were
conducted at RMG, following an investigation, an Investigation Officer within
RMG would send a ‘green investigation file’ to the CLT. The investigation
file and its papers would then be reviewed by the head of the CLT and the
file would be allocated to a criminal lawyer within the team to provide advice
on prosecution. Each case would be considered in accordance with the two
stages of the Full Code Test within the Code for Crown Prosecutors (“the
Code”) and RMG’s own internal policies and procedures on prosecuting
cases. | cannot comment on the procedure for cases which were dealt with

by CK.

The rationale behind the practice of bringing private prosecutions

11.At the time of my employment at both RMG and POL, all potential cases
were investigated and prosecuted by POL / RMG, rather than being referred
to the Police or Crown Prosecution Service. | was not involved in the
rationale behind the reasoning for this as it was put in place long before |

started, but | was aware that this was the common practice with other public

Page 4 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

services, such as the Department for Work and Pensions or HM Revenue

and Customs.

Policies governing prosecution and charging decisions and the conduct of

prosecutions

12.|n consideration of the policies governing prosecution and charging
decisions, and the conduct of prosecutions, | have reviewed the following

documents:

i. Post Office Internal Prosecution Policy (Dishonesty) (December 1997)
(POL00030659);

ii. Paragraph 3.3 of the Investigation and Prosecution Policy (March
2000) (POL00031012);

iii. $SO2 Royal Mail Group Ltd Criminal Investigation and Prosecution
Policy (1 December 2007) (POL00030578), which appears to be
substantially the same as the policy of the same date with a variation
on the title (POL00104812) (see, in particular, section 3);

xviii. Post Office Limited Prosecution Policy for England and Wales (version

1, 22 January 2016) (POL00030811).

13.1 can confirm that during my time as in-house criminal lawyer, | was familiar
with the policies listed above save for the final document listed as this post-
dates my employment with POL. At the time, | was primarily concerned with
the Prosecution Policy, but less familiar with the other policies. | can recall
that when we drafted the initial advice, we did so from a template, which
prompted you to review, stage by stage, every evidential aspect of the

Prosecution Policy and Disclosure Policy.

14.1 was not involved in contributing or developing any of the policies listed
above. | believe that on the separation of RMG and POL, POL adopted all

of RMG policies.

15.| am described as the owner of the ‘Post Office Prosecution Policy’ (version
1.0) (effective from 1 April 2012) (POL00031034). By being ‘owner’ of a
prosecution policy, it means that | adopted the policy on behalf of POL on its

separation from RMG.

16.It was the policy of POL to prosecute those suspected of committing theft,
fraud and / or false accounting, as it had been the policy of RMG
beforehand. The aim and rationale behind this was both to hold the offender

to account and to deter potential offenders. POL would, however, only

Page 7 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

prosecute if they were satisfied that the Full Code Test in the Code had

been met.

17.In terms of the organisational structure of the CLT, | can recall that around
1995 the structure was: Head of the Criminal Law Team, 7/8 criminal
lawyers, 3 legal executives, 3 support staff and 5 secretaries. To be clear, |

was one of the criminal lawyers.

18.The structure subsequently changed gradually over time with people leaving
and was reduced to: Head of CLT, 3 lawyers, 2 legal executives, 2
secretaries and 1 admin staff. To confirm, when RMG and POL separated
on 1 April 2012 and | was transferred to POL, | was the sole in-house
criminal lawyer. It was at this point that POL contracted CK to prosecute on

behalf of POL.

19.At RMG, investigations were carried out by the RMG Investigations and
Security Team. | note that the Inquiry have referred to a ‘Fraud Team’. From
memory, the Investigation and Security Team and the Fraud Team are one
and the same and therefore, going forward | shall refer to them as the

Investigation and Security Team.

20.Once received, the investigation papers (green sleeve file) were passed to
CLT who would assess the evidence and provide advice in relation to
prosecution and charges. The decision to prosecute was taken by the

Investigation and Security Team, for those cases where there was a

Page 8 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

decision to prosecute. If the case was local (in or around London), CLT
would continue to deal with the case and occasionally | would do the
advocacy for the administrative hearings in the Magistrates Court. If the
case was further afield, CLT would contract one of the agents on their panel

to deal with the case for them.

2

=

. The people responsible for supervision and conduct of prosecutions were
the Head of Security and Head of the CLT. Counsel, who was instructed on
the case and the lawyer with conduct over the case, would also keep it

continuously under review in accordance with the Code.

22.1 do not know what qualifications or training the Head of Security or Head of
CLT had although | can recall that Counsel and agents for each case would
have had training on the workings of the Horizon IT system. | also attended

training on the Horizon IT system, first in the late 90s and later in 2012.

23.At RMG, the Head of CLT and the lawyer dealing with that particular case,
was responsible for supervising and reviewing the conduct of the
prosecution. At POL, the supervision and review of a case was done entirely

by CK although they would occasionally ask for my input.

24.1 cannot recall that the Post Office policy regarding prosecution of Crown
Office employees was any different from the policy and practice regarding

prosecution of sub-postmasters and their managers / assistants.

Page 9 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

25.1 can confirm that | have reviewed the Separation Project — Criminal
Investigations Policy for Post Office Ltd (POL00104900) and the

Prosecution Policy Paper dated January 2013 (POL00039969).

26. These would have been used by the Investigation and Security Team when
conducting investigations. There were no changes to the policies when POL
and RMG separated as | recall that POL adopted all of RMG’s prosecution

policies.

27.1 can confirm that | am the ‘one in house Criminal Lawyer’ referred to, at
paragraph 2.4 of the January 2013 Prosecution Policy Paper
(POL00039969).

28.1 worked closely with Martin Smith and Simon Clark (both of CK) and we
would discuss any cases as and when needed. However, | was more

involved from an administrative, rather than legal, perspective.

29.| have been asked to describe the ‘network of external legal agents and
Counsel’ used to manage the prosecution process. These were used by
RMG and | can recall that we had a panel of agents throughout England,
Wales and Scotland to deal with cases when we didn’t have the resources
to deal with them or if the case was located a long way away from London. |
cannot recall the exact number and full list, but | remember that the main
Counsel chambers were Bell Yard Chambers in London, John Dove in

Birmingham (Solicitor advocate) and Cardiff Chambers. From 2012

Page 10 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

onwards, POL used CK exclusively who had their own in-house Counsel

and lawyers.

30.1 was not involved in the analysis conducted by POL and referred in the

Prosecution Policy Paper dated January 2013 (POL00039969).

Involvement of the Criminal Law Team in advising on investigations

31.1 did not have any involvement into the input or formulation of any policies or
guidance. At POL, previous RMG policies and guidance were simply
adopted. Due to my lack of involvement, | cannot confirm or deny whether
CLT approved advice on the application of relevant codes of practice issued

under statute guidelines, case law and any relevant material.

32.1 do not know whether the CLT had any role in the provision of training to
members of the Investigation and Security Team involved in criminal
investigations, although | personally did not give any training to the
Investigation and Security Team when | was in RMG. However, on
separation of the businesses, | made arrangements with CK to provide

training for the Investigation and Security Team.

33.When | was at RMG, my advice memos to the Investigation Team would
give advice as to what additional witness statements/evidence were
needed, but beyond this | cannot recall providing any advice on particular

cases as to what investigations to make or lines of enquiry to pursue.

Page 11 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

However, other members of the team may have done so. | cannot recall

providing any advice on this when | was at POL, although CK may have

done so.

Guidance provided to the Security Team on the conduct of investigations

34.1 can confirm that the Inquiry have provided me with, and | have reviewed,

the following documents in answering their questions on this subject matter:

The Casework management document (POL00104747 and
POL00104777)

David Posnett’s email dated 23 May 2011 (POL00118096) and the
documents contained within the attached compliance zip file
(POL00118108, POL00118109, POL00118101, POL00118102,
POL00118103, POL00118104, POL001181105, POL00118106 and
POL00118107)

David Posnett’s email dated 29 May 2011 (POL00115665) and the
documents contained within the compliance zip file (POL00115666,
POL00115667, POL00115668, POL00115669, POL00115670,
POL00115671, POL00115672, POL00115673 and POLO00115674).
David Posnett’s email dated 27 April 2012 (POL00118110) and the
attachments (POL00118120, POL00118121, POL00118122,
POL00118123, POL00118124, POL00118125, POL00118126,

POL00118127, POL00118128).

Page 12 of 89

v. David Posnett’s email dated 18 December 2012 (POL00118289) and
the indices attached (POL00118290 and POL00118377)

vi. The email dated 28 July 2016 (POL00118129) and the documents
contained within the attached compliance zip file (POL00118130,
POL00118131, POL00118132, POL00118133, POL00118134,

POL00118135 and POLO0118136)

35.At the outset, | would like to flag that | was not involved in any guidance
provided to the Security Team on the conduct of investigations and had no
input into it at all. My comments below are based on a review of the

documents.

36.1! cannot recall either the 2000 or 2002 version of the Casework
Management Document. | did not have any input into these documents and
| was not involved in the development, management or amendment of them.
My knowledge is that it was the Information and Security Team who would

have been responsible for them and would have used them.

37.1 did not deal with these documents and the instructions / guidance given in
them was for the Security Team as part of their training as to how to put
investigation reports together. My understanding of them now is therefore
not based on any prior knowledge. | have reviewed them and understand
that they are giving instructions as to the content and presentation of

Investigation Reports.

Page 13 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

38.As to the relevance of these instructions, in relation to Post Offices’
disclosure obligations, my view is that the instructions clearly required
investigators to put the separate report on Form CSOO6D and possibly
CS6006E when reviewing the case. My role would have then been to review
those documents and decide whether they were disclosable or not. Had the
documents disclosed Horizon bug errors and defects, my duty was to
disclose these documents to the Defence as they were documents which

would undermine the prosecution case and assist the defence case.

39.At the time the suite of compliance documents contained within the
compliance zip file was circulated (listed at ‘i’ above), | considered their
status as guidance, in that | understood that their purpose was to be used
as guides, given to investigators by senior managers of the Security Team.
To my knowledge and recollection, the CLT had no input and |, personally,

certainly did not have any input into them.

40. There are two documents, both entitled ‘Guide to the Preparation and
Layout of Investigation Red Label Case Files. Offender report and Discipline
reports’ (POL000118101 and POL00115671). As to how these relate to the
Offender Report Template (POL00118102), my understanding of paragraph
2.15 (on p.10) in the first of these documents (POL00118101), is that a
comprehensive list of all failures in security, supervision, procedures and
product integrity must be highlighted bold in a Suspect Offender Report. |
understand that both documents give guidance as to the preparation of

Suspect Offender Reports. | therefore assume that these documents

Page 14 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

informed the content and creation of the Offender Report Template. | do not
feel able to comment on these documents beyond what is stated in them as

| do not recall them.

41.The Inquiry refers to the email of 23 May 2011 (POL00118096) and email of
29 March 2012 (POL00115665) as my emails. However, these were emails

sent by Dave Posnett and | was not a recipient of either.

42.1 had no involvement in drafting the documents entitled identification codes
(POL00118128) attached to David Posnetts’ email of 25" May 2011
(POL00118128) and 29" March 2012 and (POL00118131) attached to

email dated 28" July 2016.

43.1 cannot say why the Security Team investigators were instructed to assign
identification codes to suspected offenders as | was not part of any decision
or conversation in this matter. | cannot recall reviewing the document

entitled ‘Identification Codes’.

Process for prosecution and charging decisions

44. The below considers the process that was followed by POL/RMG in relation
to prosecution and charging decisions once an initial investigation had been
conducted by the Security Team. In answering the Inquiry’s questions

around this subject matter, | have reviewed the following documents:

appears to be substantially the same as the policy of the same date
with a variation on the title at POL00104812);

xiii. | Section 6 of “Post Office Limited Prosecution Policy for England and

Wales” (version 1, 22 January 2016) (POL00030811).

45. The ‘nominated decision maker’ within the Security Team was responsible
for making prosecution and charging decisions in respect of
subpostmasters, managers, assistants and Crown Office employees alleged
to be responsible for shortfalls shown by data from the Horizon IT system.
At POL, the person responsible for this was the Head of Security, John
Scott. This decision would be taken after seeking input from the CLT and

subsequently by CK when they took over conduct of criminal prosecutions.

46. The legal advice and draft charges would be drafted by CLT/CK and sent to
the Investigation and Security Team. The decision maker would then read
the advice and decide, at that stage, whether or not to accept the advice
and prosecute. If they decided to proceed, they would get the Investigation

Officer to issue the summons at the local Magistrates’ Court.

47.| cannot comment as to what training or qualifications all those providing

legal advice on prosecution, draft charges and charging decisions had, but

Page 17 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

certainly within the CLT everybody was a qualified lawyer as far as | can

recall.

48.1 cannot recall whether those involved in investigating a suspected offence
ever input into advice on whether the test for prosecution was met.
However, any case that | looked at, | would have considered in line with the

Code and Post Office policies.

The test applied

and charging decisions. | can confirm that in answering the Inquiry’s

questions on this, | have reviewed the following documents:

Wales’ (version 1, 22 January 2016) (POL00030811).

50.1 cannot comment on others, but | can confirm that | would always consider

the evidential and public interest test in reviewing and drafting my initial

advice and throughout the subsequent lifetime of a case. In my view, the

test to be applied in making a prosecution/charging decision was adequate.

5

=

.At the outset, legal advice was all given internally by CLT / CK. When the

matter was committed to the Crown Court, once instructed, Counsel were

asked to draft the indictment and in doing so, look at the summons, and

also to provide advice on evidence. Essentially they would revisit and review

the whole case.

52.When | was asked to advise on a case, | would that the advice had regard

to both the Code and relevant POL policies. It was a matter of policy that all

Page 19 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

advice and decisions were made in line with the public interest and

evidential tests of the Code.

The conduct of prosecutions

53.When conducting a prosecution, during my time at both RMG and POL |
was alive to all of my responsibilities and duties under relevant legislations,

codes, policies and principles including, but not limited to:

i. The Code (and related CPS guidance)
ii. | Attorney General’s Guidelines on Disclosure
iii. | SRA Standards and Regulations
iv. Internal policies and procedures as listed at paragraph [15] above

v. Criminal Procedures and Investigations Act 1996

54. Initially, RMG had conduct of private prosecution and then, on separation of

the businesses, this was CK. The role of the agents was to attend Court on

behalf of the RMG and conduct the prosecution.

Disclosure

55.The Polices would incorporate the relevant legal legislations, codes, policies

and principles and give guidance on how to comply with them.

Page 20 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

56.1 was not involved in and therefore cannot comment on, what guidance was
given in the RMG / POL policies about disclosure from third parties, such as
Fujitsu. Any disclosure from a third party would have been requested from

the Investigation Officer who was assigned to that case.

57.As to my understanding of disclosure obligations, | am aware of the
obligations on a prosecutor to ensure that all relevant disclosure is given to
the defence, including that which may undermine the prosecution case. The
duty to review disclosure and subsequently disclose where necessary, is

ongoing.

58.1 have been asked whether the individual(s) who held the role of disclosure
officer also held the role of Investigation Officer and / or decision maker. |

am unable to answer this question as | have no personal knowledge.

59.In terms of disclosure when | was at CLT, an individual from the
Investigation and Security Team would prepare a disclosure schedule with a
list of the relevant and appropriate documents. This would be sent to CLT,
as part of the initial papers sent with the investigation report. The CLT
lawyer who received the papers, including me if | was allocated the file,
would review the disclosure and check that everything in it was relevant and
disclosable. If | felt that anything was missing, | would request it and, once
satisfied, serve the disclosure on the Defence as appropriate. My disclosure
duty was ongoing and therefore if | received or was made aware of a

relevant document at any point in the lifetime of a case, | would disclose it

Page 21 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

as appropriate. | would also deal with any disclosure requests received from
the Defence. To be clear, | was never the disclosure officer, as this was the

role of somebody within the Investigation and Security Team.

60.1 have been asked whether the individual(s) who held the role of

61.

Investigation Officer, officer in charge and / or disclosure officer, also made
decisions about the conduct of prosecutions. Due to lapse of time, | cannot
confirm or deny whether this was the case or not. However, if the
Investigation Officer had made the decision on conduct of prosecutions then

| would have had concerns about that.

| have been asked what advice | or the CLT more widely, gave to
investigators from the Investigation and Security Team about the disclosure
obligations in POL. | was the only in-house criminal lawyer at POL at the
time and | cannot recall specifically giving advice on disclosure obligations
to the Information and Security Team. However, had | been asked to give
such advice, | am confident that | would have emphasised the importance of
complying with the disclosure obligations and that it was a ongoing
obligation. | cannot confirm or deny whether CK provided such advice on

disclosure to the Investigation and Security Team.

62.1 never dealt with third parties and so my role never included giving any

advice in relation to disclosure to third parties. The only exception to this
was in the case of Mrs Misra, when the Security and Investigation Team

asked me to obtain answers raised by the Defence about the functioning of

Page 22 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

the Horizon system and | contacted the Head of Legal at Fujitsu to escalate
this request. Further information on this is given below and the contact did

not include giving any advice on disclosure, other than to request it.

63.Once a case was committed to the Crown Court, Counsel were briefed to

draft the indictment and provide advice on evidence.

64.When | was at RMG, | did not seek any external advice on the Horizon IT

system, with the exception of the case of Mrs Misra.

65. Once the Defence Case Statement or Defence Statement were received, |
would ensure that it was dealt with appropriately and that any further
disclosure that was raised, was also disclosed where relevant. | would
ensure that the statements and enclosures were sent to Counsel to advise
on and the Investigation Officers to deal with and provide. This was before
separation of the businesses. On separation, CK took over control of the

disclosure as well as all aspects of prosecution.

66.In addition and as noted in the cases below, for example the case of Mr
Wilson, where potential issues were raised about the Horizon IT system, |
would always request a witness statement to address the IT issues.
However, as happened in Mr Wilson’s case, the sub postmaster pleaded
guilty to the false accounting offence while the collation and service of such

further evidence was still pending.

Page 23 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

67.1 cannot provide any further comments where it was alleged in a Defence
Case Statement or Defence Statement that a discrepancy was attributed to
problems with the Horizon IT system as, other than the case of Mrs Misra, |

cannot recall dealing with any cases where this was alleged.

Experts

68.In the cases that | personally dealt with, no experts were instructed and |
was not made aware by any other members of CLT or external agents, of

any experts being instructed in respect of any other cases either.

69. In the case of Misra, the Defence expert Report raised questions and |
contacted the Investigation and Security Team to ask whether they could
answer these questions. | was told that the request needed to be made in
writing and it could take weeks for a response. | was worried that the normal
systems and procedures for obtaining information from Fujitsu would be too
slow and so | also contacted David Jones, Head of Legal at Fujitsu, to
escalate the request so that it would be dealt with as quickly as possible to
comply with the Court Order. Subsequently, Gareth Jenkins was put forward
to deal with the Defence’s requests as someone who was in a position to
deal with the issues raised by the Defence expert, but | understand that his
role was initially limited to that of a lay witness who knew the Horizon
system well. As far as | can recall the Post Office did not seek to rely on him
as an expert witness, or at least not initially. Subsequently, due to his

expertise and qualifications, the Court considered him an expert.

Page 24 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

70. Document UKGI00015008 references a meeting which | attended with
Gareth Jenkins, Warwick Tatford and John Longman in October 2010. | do
not recall this meeting or ever discussing Gareth Jenkins’ witness statement
with him. As far as | recall, | had very limited involvement with Mr Jenkins. |
cannot recall any discussions where he was informed of his duties to the
Court, although | would have assumed Counsel would have informed him of

the same.

71.1 am not aware of and | do not recall any policy or guidelines in place

regarding the provision of evidence by employees of Fujitsu.

72.Given that the Horizon IT system was a unique system, | felt that the
questions from the Defence should be answered by somebody who knew
the system well. Mr Jenkins was put forward as such a person and my
understanding was that he had the most experience and knowledge of the
system to provide full answers and analyse the data in full and | therefore
considered him to be an appropriate witness. | understood that it was made
clear that Mr Jenkins was an employee of Fujitsu. | knew that his Section 9
statement told him that he had to be truthful otherwise he would be liable for
prosecution. With the benefit of hindsight, | can see that it would have been
more appropriate for somebody from outside of the organisation to have
been utilised who could have been relied on as an expert witness. However,
| feel that it would have been difficult to find somebody who was an

independent expert, who had the experience and knowledge of the Horizon

Page 25 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

IT system, but did not work at Fujitsu. | did not feel that a person without
such knowledge or expertise of the Horizon IT system would be in as good

as position to assist the court as a lay witness with that specific knowledge.

Criminal enforcement proceedings

73.| have been asked in what circumstances steps were taken to restrain a
suspect's assets by criminal enforcement methods such as confiscation
proceedings. | am unable to answer this question as the decision to start

confiscation proceedings was made by the Confiscation Department.

74.1 have also been asked who decided whether criminal enforcement
proceedings should be pursued and what factors were considered when
making decisions around this. Again, decisions as to whether enforcement
proceedings should be pursued were made by a different department and

therefore | am unable to comment on this.

75.| have also been asked about the process that was followed by the
Financial Investigation Unit and what part the CLT played in this process in
criminal enforcement proceedings. In answering this question, | have
reviewed the Financial Investigation Unit process documentation

(POL00084988 and POL00084989).

76.My understanding is that when a sub postmaster was found guilty,

repayment directions were given by the Court. Counsel would forward these

Page 26 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

to CLT who would make sure that they were complied with by the Defence.
If enforcement proceedings were needed because the directions were not
complied with, the Investigation and Security Team would approach us and
we would make the appropriate application the Court. To clarify, this was
before the separation of the businesses. When the businesses separated,

enforcement proceedings were dealt with by CK.

INVOLVEMENT IN CRIMINALPROSECUTION CASE STUDIES

77.The below deals with the following cases in turn:

i. Rv David Blakey
ii. Rv Suzanne Palmer
iii. | Rv Susan Rudkin
iv. Rv Julian Wilson
v. Rv Seema Misra
vi. Action against Joan Bailey
vii. Rv Lynette Hutchings
viii. Rv Grant Allen
ix. Rv Angela Sefton and R v Anne Nield

x. Rv Khayyam Ishaq

78.Before | begin, | would like to express my deepest sympathies to each and
every sub postmaster whose case | dealt with and to confirm that | have

read all of their Impact Statements. | took my role as a criminal prosecutor

Page 27 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

seriously and always thought that | was following the correct course of
action based on the information and evidence | had in front of me. To learn
that the Horizon system was not reliable and that these sub postmasters
were wrongly convicted is deeply saddening. In particular, | would like to
express my deepest sympathies to Julian Wilson’s wife, upon learning that

Mr Wilson passed away before his conviction was overturned.

R -v- David Blakey

79.To assist me in answering the Inquiry’s questions in relation to this case, |

have considered the following documents:

i. The Record of Tape Recorded Interview with David Blakey dated 13
May 2004 (POL00044830 (part 1) and POL00044831 (part 2));
ii. |The summary of key points from an interview with Gillian Blakey
(POL00044829);
iii. |The Investigation Report dated 25 May 2004 (POL00044818);
iv. The Notification of Proceedings to Police forms relating to Mr Blakey
(POL00044821 and POL00044822);

v. My memo to S & A Casework dated 23 June 2004 (POL00044835).

80.1 can confirm that | was the solicitor who had conduct of this case for POL.

81.1 first become involved in the case of Mr Blakey when the file was allocated

to me by the Head of CLT. The Head of CLT would receive the file from the

Page 28 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

Investigation and Security Team, review the investigation papers and
evidence relating to the case, and allocate it to a member of the CLT which,

in this case, was me.

82.Normally, | would get involved in a case around 2 weeks before providing
the advice. From the documents, it appears that this would have been
around June 2004 as per my advice to S and A case work dated 23 June

2004 (POL00044835),.

83.Due to the passage of time, | cannot recall what papers were considered
and were before me when | wrote this advice. However, in principle, an ideal
file should contain the investigation report, tapes of recorded interviews,
audit report, disclosure schedule, contract of the sub-postmaster and
witness statements, including one giving an account of the operation of the

Horizon system.

84.My advice was written prior to the issue of any criminal proceedings against

Mr Blakey.

85.As with all cases, in giving my advice, | would apply the two-stages of the
Full Code Test of the Code; the evidential test and the public interest test.
My advice would be drafted from a template advice note which would give a
list of the factors that | needed to take into consideration when applying this
test. For example, when considering if prosecution was in the public

interest, | would look at the period of offending, any admission and the

Page 29 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

amount of loss that had incurred. | also recall that the Post Office Policy was
contained in the template advice so that | could easily run through and apply

it.

86.My advice (POL00044835) states that, in my opinion, there is sufficient
evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction. My assessment of the
evidence is that there was a low prospect of securing a conviction for theft
and a high prospect for false accounting. It notes that Mr Blakey has not
made any admissions of theft and | therefore identify that further evidence is

needed, in particular from staff members.

87.1 cannot recall the name, but an individual within the Investigation and
Security Team who was responsible for making the decision for

prosecutions, would have authorised the prosecution of Mr Blakey.

88.Due to the passage of time, | cannot recall who made the charging decision
in this case. However, it would not have been the CLT as our role did not
involve charging the individual. Although the charges were drafted by us, it
was for the Investigation and Security Team to make the decision as to
whether or not they accepted the drafted charges and, ultimately issue

summons.

89. There was no Horizon data or ARQ logs requested from Fujitsu in this case.
However, the statement from Jane Kay (POL00044825) sets out the

workings of the Horizon system.

Page 30 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

90.1 have considered the draft Schedule of Non-Sensitive Unused material
(POL00044817). | cannot recall this document but it is likely that | would
have reviewed it when | provided the advice. As detailed above, the
disclosure schedule would usually be sent with the initial investigation report

for the lawyer to review when they provided the advice.

91.Due to the passage of time, | cannot recall who the disclosure officer was in

this case.

92.My role in relation to disclosure was initially to review the disclosure
schedule and to confirm that all the material disclosed was relevant and that
there were no missing documents that | was aware should be disclosed.
The schedule would then have been sent to the Defence along with the
evidence. As disclosure is an continuous obligation, | had an ongoing
obligation to review disclosure throughout the case. However, | cannot recall
specifically whether any additional disclosure was disclosed in the lifetime of

this case.

93.In respect of what witness evidence was provided in this case, | can confirm

that | have reviewed the following:

i. The unsigned witness statement of Glen Morris dated 23 November

2004 (POL00044819);

Page 31 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

ii. |The unsigned witness statement of Paul Whitaker dated 24 November
2004 (POL00044824);

ii. | The unsigned witness statement of Jayne Kaye dated 18 November
2004 (POL00044825);

iv. The unsigned witness statement of Natasha Beck dated 18 November
2004 (POL00044826);

v. The unsigned witness statement of Patricia Brown dated 15 November
2004 (POL00044827);

vi. The unsigned witness statement of Samantha Callaghan dated 15

November 2004 (POL00044828).

94. These witness statements were obtained to address issues including the
fact that it was Mr Blakey who was responsible for entering the data on the
Horizon system, the workings of the system and that no other staff had
actually stolen money from the Post Office or falsified the Post Office

accounts.

95. The purpose of obtaining each of these witnesses was as followed:

i. | Glen Morris (POL00044819) provided evidence in relation to the audit
he carried out which proved that there was a shortage of cash at Mrs
Blakey's Post Office.

ii. Paul Whittaker (POL00044824) was the Investigation Officer who
carried out an interview under caution of both Mr and Mrs Blakey and

provided evidence in relation to the same.

Page 32 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

iii. | Jane Kay (POL00044825) was a retail manager at a Post Office store
and gave evidence as to how the Horizon system worked.

iv. Natasha Beck (POL00044826) was a Post Office Clerk and gave
evidence as to her role at a sub Post Office.

v. Samantha Callaghan (POL00044828) was a member of staff at Riby
Square in Grimsby and gave evidence confirming that it was Mr Blakey

who would enter the information on the Horizon system.

96.In reflecting on the way that the investigation and prosecution was
conducted by the Post Office and the outcome of the case, | have reviewed

the following documents as provided by the Inquiry:

i. |The memo from Phil Taylor to Paul Whitaker dated 24 March 2005
(POL00044357);

ii. | The judgment of the Court of Appeal in Josephine Hamilton & Others v
Post Office Limited [2021] EWCA Crim 577 (POL00113278) (in

particular, paragraphs 347 to 352).

97.It is apparent that the Court of Appeal have accepted that Mr Blakey was
wrongly convicted and for that, | can only apologise and express my
sympathies. Had | become aware of any information/evidence or had
knowledge, at any stage of the prosecution case, that the prosecution
should not continue, | would have flagged this and advised POL and the
Court to discontinue and offer no evidence in respect of the charges faced

by Mr Blakey.

Page 33 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

98. The judgment of Josephine Hamilton and Others v Post Office Limited
[2021] (POL000113278), paragraphs 347 — 352 note the case of Mr Blakey.

In particular, paragraph 351 notes:

“POL accepts that this was an unexplained shortfall case and that evidence
from Horizon was essential to Mr Blakey’s case. There is nothing to indicate
that any ARQ data was obtained at the time of the criminal proceedings.

There was no evidence to corroborate the Horizon evidence. There was no
investigation into Horizon reliability. There was no proof of an actual loss as

opposed to a Horizon-generated shortfall.”

99. From my recollection and from reviewing the documents, the workings of
the Horizon system were never raised as an issue and ARQ data was never
requested by the Defence. | cannot comment on any investigation as this
would have been carried out by the Investigation and Security Team, prior

to me receiving the file.

100. Mr Blakey was represented by solicitors and Counsel who were entitled to
request any evidence that they needed to support his defence. |n addition,
the Defence are able to make a Section 8 application under the Criminal
Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 for disclosure should his legal
representatives have thought that evidence was being withheld from him. Mr

Blakey pleaded guilty and no such a request was made.

Page 34 of 89
WITNO04750100

WITN04750100

101.As with all cases, | was shocked when | heard of the Court of Appeal

judgement and my full sympathy goes out to Mr Blakey for all the loss and

distress that he suffered.

R -v- Suzanne Palmer

102. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the case of

Suzanne Palmer. To assist me in answering the Inquiry’s questions on this

case, | have reviewed the following documents:

vi.

vii.

viii.

The Record of Tape Recorded Interview of Suzanne Palmer on 6
February 2006 (POL00053009);

The Investigation Report by Lisa Allen dated 20 February 2006

September 2006 (POL00052993);

xiii. | The memo from Jennifer Andrews to the Investigations Team dated 20

September 2006 (POL00052998).

103.1 first became involved in the case of Mrs Palmer when | received the file for
it. Again, | cannot recall exactly when this was but it is likely to have been a

couple of weeks before writing my memo of 10 March 2006 (POL00052990)

104.1 can also not remember what information | was provided with prior to writing
this advice but please see above in relation to Mr Blakey as to what an ideal

file should contain.

105. My advice states that | was of the opinion that there was sufficient evidence
to afford a realistic prospect of conviction of Mrs Palmer for the offences of
false accounting. | also advise on what additional evidence/statements may

be needed.

Page 36 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

106.As confirmed with the case of Mr Blakey, | would have considered both the
evidential and public interest test from the Full Code Test when drafting my
advice. Please see my answer above to Mr Blakey as to what this would

have involved.

107.1 cannot recall my reasoning at the time, but having reviewed my advice, it
appears that my reasoning for prosecution and recommendation for the
Crown Court was based on the seriousness of the offence and the high
deficiency in the account. In considering whether it was in the public interest
to prosecute, | would also have taken into account the fact that Mrs Palmer

was in a position of trust and the losses related to public money.

108. The Investigation Report by Lisa Allen dated 20 February 2006

(POL00053007) confirms that Tony Utting was the designated prosecution

authority in Mrs Palmer’s case. Therefore, | understand that it would have

been him who authorised her prosecution. In terms of the charges, we (the

legal team) would draft the charges and Tony Utting would approve them.

109. No Horizon data was requested in this case.

110.1 can confirm that | have considered the following documents:

i. The memo from Jennifer Andrews to the Investigations Team dated 11

October 2006 (POL00052992);

Page 37 of 89
WITNO04750100

My memo to the Investigation Team dated 19 January 2007
(POL00052997);

My memo to the Investigation Team dated 23 January 2007

(POL00053000).

111.1 cannot recall who the disclosure officer was in this case.

112. In terms of my role in relation to disclosure in these proceedings, they were

the same as above in relation to Mr Blakey.

113. In reflecting on the way that the investigation and prosecution of Mrs Palmer

was conducted and the subsequent outcome of this case, | have reviewed

the following:

The memo from Jennifer Andrews to the Investigation Team dated 31
January 2007 (POL00052982);
The Casework Management Initial Tick List for the Palmer case

(POL00052984).

Page 38 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

114.Mrs Palmer was found Not Guilty by the jury. However, | appreciate that she
still suffered loss and distress from the incorrect accusations from the Post

Office and my full sympathies are extended to her.

R -v- Susan Rudkin

115. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the case of Susan
Rudkin. To assist me in answering the Inquiry’s questions on this case, |

have considered the following documents:

i. Letter from Mr Rudkin to Paul Hemley dated 14 January 2004
(POL00060416);
ii. Letter to Mr Rudkin dated 18 January 2005 (POL00061521);

iii. Incident report from 2004 (POL0006526).

116.1 have reviewed the Incident Report from 2004 (POL00065265) which
confirms that an error had been identified in Giro bank withdrawals of
£48.96 being erroneously entered twice. | have no specific recollection of
‘phantom’ banking transactions being reported by Miss Rudkin at the branch
in January 2005 and there is no mention of it in my memo to the Fraud

Team dated 3 October 2008 (POL00046488).

117.1 have considered the following documents:

i. The handwritten notes (POL00045243 and POL00045246);

WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

The Record of Tape Recorded Interview of 20 August 2008
(POL00050026);

My memo to the Fraud Team dated 3 October 2008 (POL00046488);
The Schedule of Charges (POL00045220);

The memo from Mike Wilcox to me dated 29 January 2009
(POL00046505);

My memo to the Fraud Team dated 6 February 2009 (POL00046506);

The Summons dated 12 February 2009 (POL00046537).

118. | first became involved in the case of Susan Rudkin when | received the

‘green file’, after it was allocated by the Head of CLT. As with the other

cases, this would have been a couple of weeks before my report, so roughly

around mid-September.

119. Following my review of the file, | reported back to the Fraud Team by way of

a memo dated 3 October 2008 (POL00046488). | cannot recall, and the

documents do not assist me in recalling, what information/evidence |

considered prior to writing my advice memo on 3 October 2008. However,

please refer to my comments in respect of Mr Blakey as to what an ideal file

should contain.

120.As confirmed with the case of Mr Blakey and Mrs Palmer, | would have

considered both the evidential and public interest test as required by the

Code when drafting my advice.

Page 40 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

121.1 cannot recall my reasoning, but based on the memo, my advice states that
the evidence is sufficient to afford a realistic prospect of conviction. My
advice confirms that although | have recommended a charge for the offence
of theft, the case may also be considered for false accounting charges at a
later stage. | have also recommended what further evidence / witness

statements are required.

122.| cannot recall who authorised the prosecution of Mrs Rudkin, although it is
likely that it would have been somebody senior to Mike Wilcox, Investigation

Officer. | also cannot recall who made the charging decision in this case.

123.No Horizon data was requested in this case.

124.1 can confirm that | have considered the following documents:

i. |The emails from March 2009 (POL00051044 and POL00059762);
ii. |The letters from Mr Rudkin dated 25 February 2009 (POL00044916)

and 3 April 2009 (POL00060421).

125.| have been asked what, if any, impact Mr Rudkin’s letters had on decisions
relating to the prosecution of Mrs Rudkin. | do not recall having seen them
or having had any knowledge of them at the time of prosecution and | note
that they post-date the prosecution decision. Had | received them at the
time, | would have reviewed them in light of the public interest test. | cannot

say now whether | would have considered this correspondence alone, in the

127.

128.

WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

absence of medical evidence, to have caused me to reach a different view,
but | certainly would have raised this with Counsel and the Investigation and

Security Team for their consideration.

| have considered the letter from Richard Nelson solicitors to Mike Wilcox
dated 7 April 2009 (POL00046524). This confirms that Mrs Rudkin is
declining to attend Loughborough Police Station on a voluntary basis and
encloses a copy of a letter from Dr A T Peded dated 22 February 2009,
which confirms that she is not fit to be interviewed (POL00050993) due to
her poor mental health. | cannot remember being aware of the extent of Mrs
Rudkin’s poor mental health. From the documentation, the only information
relating to her health was contained in the memo from Mike Wilcox to me
(POL00046505) which states “/ have since been in contact with Richard
Nelson solicitors...who have notified me that Mrs Rudkin does not wish to
attend a further interview as they have concerns over her deteriorating
mental health.” \f | had had sight of Mrs Rudkin’s doctor's letter
(POL00050993), | would have certainly considered it and raised with the

Investigation and Security Team for their consideration.

| can confirm that | have considered the letter to Richard Nelson solicitors
dated 19 February 2009 (POL00050990). | cannot recall who the disclosure

officer was in this case.

My role in relation to disclosure in these proceedings was the same as

described above in relation to Mr Blakey.

WITN04750100

129. In terms of what criminal enforcement proceedings were taken against Mrs
Rudkin and what my involvement was in these proceedings, | have had to
refresh my memory with the documents that the Inquiry provided me with
(detailed in the following paragraphs). A summary of the events of the case

are detailed in the Financial Investigation Log (POL00057602).

130. Document POL00050242 is a Restraint Order to prevent the disposal of
assets. This would have been done at the outset of prosecution by the

Financial Investigation accredited officers, not the CLT.

131.Document POL00051380 is a memo from Rob Wilson to the Fraud Team
dated 6 May 2009, which confirms that Mrs Rudkin was charged with
stealing £43,894.15 belonging to Post Office Limited, contrary to Section
1(1) of the Theft Act 1968, for which she was sentenced to 12 months
imprisonment suspended for 2 years with a Community Order of 300 unpaid
work and electronically monitored curfew for 6 months requiring her to stay

indoors between the hours of 10pm and 5am.

132.On 8 July 2009 | sent a letter enclosing the Prosecution Statement under
Section 16 together with supporting documents to the Defence

(POL00052029).

133.On 24 July 2009, Counsel were briefed to attend the Confiscation Hearing

at Stratford Crown Court on 21 August 2009 (POL00052094).

On 12 August 2010 | received a letter (POL0055156). This lays out the
financial circumstances and difficulties of Mr and Mrs Rudkin and ultimately
asks me to consider whether a variation on the basis of inadequacy would
be a suitable way forward. Upon receipt of this letter, | passed it on to the
Financial Investigation Department to consider and for their further
instructions. It would not have been a matter for me to decide. | cannot
recall the response of the Financial Investigation Department. | would also

have forwarded it onto Counsel / the agents for their information.

Document POL00055203 is a letter written from me on 31 August 2010
which confirms that a further hearing for a Confiscation Order will be heard

at Birmingham Magistrates Court on 30 November 2010.

Document POL00057602 gives a summary of the case. This a document

created for internal administrative purposes and | had no input into it.

| can recall very little about this case, as | did not carry out the investigation
of Mrs Rudkin, or attend her Court hearing. | have therefore relied heavily
upon the documents provided to me by the Inquiry. From reviewing the
documents, it appears that the prosecution case itself was relatively
straightforward and concluded by way of an early guilty plea with the Court
imposing a sentence. However, as with the other subpostmasters who were
wrongly convicted, | extend my sympathies to Mrs Rudkin for her wrongful

conviction and in particular, the effect that this had on her mental health.

R -v- Julian Wilson

138. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the case against

the late Julian Wilson.

139.To assist me in answering the Inquiry’s questions on this case, | have

considered the following documents:

i. |The Record of Tape Recorded Interview dated 15 September 2008
(POL00050140 (part 1) and POL00050128 (part 2));
ii. | My memo to the Fraud Team dated 6 January 2009 (POL00044806);
iii. |The Schedule of charges (POL00047083);
iv. The email dated 23 January 2009 (POL00050763);

v. My letter to Mr Wilson's solicitors dated 2 April 2009 (POL00051265).

140.1 cannot recall exactly when | became involved in this case. My memo
(POL00044806) is dated 6 January 2009 and therefore, taking into account
Christmas and New Year, | would have likely become first involved around

mid-December.

141. Again, | cannot recall, and the documents do not assist me in recalling, what
information/evidence | considered prior to writing this advice memo.
However, as with the other cases, please see my comments in relation to

Mr Blakey as to what an ideal file would contain.

Page 45 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

142.1 advised the Investigation and Security Team that there was sufficient
evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction for the offences of theft
and false accounting. | advised that if the Defendant offered a guilty plea to
false accounting then it is advisable that the prosecution should accept this
plea and not proceed with the theft charge. The memo confirms that this
advice is in view of Mr Wilson’s admissions to false accounting in interview

under caution and denial of theft.

143.As with all cases, when drafting this advice, | would have considered the full
code tests as required by the Code, including whether it was in the public

interest to prosecute Mr Wilson.

144.1 cannot recall who authorised the prosecution of Mr Wilson. | assume that
the Team Leader within the Investigations Team or else a designated
decision maker within the Investigation and Security Team would have done

so. It would not have been the Investigation Officer.

145. Similarly, | cannot recall the name, but the decision maker would have

requested summons be issued in this case.

146.No Horizon data was requested from Fujitsu in this case. However, in my
advice note to Counsel dated 22 May 2009 (POL00044751) it notes that |
have requested further witness statements, including a statement

addressing the IT system.

147.1 can confirm that | have considered the following documents:

The Schedule of Non-Sensitive Unused Material dated 18 March 2009
(POL00051194);

The memo from Rob Wilson to me dated 6 May 2009 (POL00051385);

handwritten comments (POL00051920);

My letter to Richard Nelson Solicitors dated 19 May 2009
(UKGI00012555);

Counsel's Advice dated 22 May 2009 (POL00044751) and the draft
Case Summary (POL00044809);

My memo to the Fraud Team dated 28 May 2009 (POL00051720);

My letter to Mr Wilson’s solicitors dated 28 May 2009 (POL00051715);

The Hearsay Notice (POL00047026) (page 2 onwards).

148. My role in relation to disclosure in these proceedings was the same as

detailed above in the case of Mr Blakey.

149. The information that was requested by Mr Wilson's solicitors is contained in

their letter of 14 May 2009 (POL00051920). This requests a draft indictment

and a schedule of unused material. It also notes that there are a number of

prosecutions being pursued by The Royal Mail Group Ltd which are similar

Page 47 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

to that of Mr Wilson’s and asks for the details of the number of prosecutions

that are currently ongoing and details as to the geographic location of such

prosecutions.

150.1 cannot recall whether | considered the request by the time | wrote to Mr

Wilson's solicitors on 19 May 2009 but it is likely that | did as it encloses one

of the requested items; the schedule of unused material. Furthermore, three

days after writing this letter, Counsel write an advice note (POL0004751)

referring to the request on 14 May 2009 at paragraph 7. It is likely that |

would have sent them this information a few days prior to writing the advice

note, which means | would have also considered it a few days prior to

receiving the advice note.

151. Following Counsel's advice, | forwarded the same to the Investigation and

Security Team and asked them to make further enquiries and deal with the

matters set out in it (POL00051720).

152.| have considered the following documents:

Counsel's Brief endorsed following the hearing on 15 June 2009
(POL00051459);
Counsel's endorsed copy of the Indictment (POL00044800);

John H. Dove's letter to me dated 17 June 2009 (POL00051936).

Page 48 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

153. Based on these documents, there does not appear to have been any further
disclosure provided to the Defence following receipt of Counsel's advice
before the Plea and Case Management Conference on 15 June 2009

although it is not clear and | cannot specifically recall.

154. John Dove's letter dated 17 June 2009 (POL00051936) summarises what
happened at the Plea and Case Management Hearing on 15 June 2009.
This notes that Mr Wilsons’ Counsel was anxious to reach some form of
acceptable compromise to avoid a trial. A deal was subsequently struck
whereby Mr Wilson would plead guilty on a basis of plea of an acceptance
of the false accounting in the years 2007 and 2008, but for the full amount
of the shortfall of £27,811.98. On arraignment, Mr Wilson pleaded Not Guilty
to Counts 1, 2 and 3 but Guilty to Counts 4 and 5. These pleas were

accepted and Counts 1, 2 and 3 were dismissed.

155. Document POL000119134 is a memo, confirming that in the Sentencing
Hearing, Mr Wilson was sentenced to 200 hours of community order on
account of both counts. He was also ordered to pay prosecution costs and a

Confiscation timetable was set.

156. In relation to what criminal enforcement proceedings were taken against

Julian Wilson and what my involvement was in these proceedings, | have

considered the following documents:

The letter from Richard Nelson Solicitors dated 14 January 2008

The memo from Miss Andrews dated 11 January 2010

(POL001 19126);

My memo dated 21 December 2010 (POL00119206).

157. These documents confirm that Mr Wilson was subject to a Restraint Order.

The same as with Mrs Rudkin, this was dealt with by the Financial

Investigation accredited officers, not the CLT.

158. Mr Wilson was also ordered to provide, and serve, financial information and

document POL00052047 confirms that | forwarded details of a registration

of a charge on Mr and Mrs Wilson's re-mortgage of their property to the

Fraud Team. | am unable to comment on Mr Wilson’s criminal proceedings

Page 50 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

beyond what is contained in these documents, but document POL00044749
provides a Financial Investigation Events Log which provides an overview of

the case, including what aspects | was involved in.

159. The memo of Jenny Andrew of 11 January 2010 (POL00119126) confirms
that Mr Wilson agreed to pay £28,434.95 within 6 months of the hearing i.e.
before 17 June 2010. A Compensation Order was also made for this
amount. My memo (POL00119206) confirms that the Order was postponed

by 6 months, giving a maximum statutory period of 12 months.

160. The Inquiry have directed me to the judgment of Josephine Hamilton and
Others v Post Office Limited [2021] EWCA Crim 577 (POL00113278),

paragraphs 175 — 178. In particular, | have noted that paragraph 177 states:

“POL accepts that this was an unexplained shortfall case and that evidence
from Horizon was essential to Mr Wilson’s case. Based on the papers
available from the criminal proceedings, there is nothing to suggest any
ARQ data was obtained. POL did not investigate any of the criticisms of
Horizon made by Mr Wilson historically and during his detailed interview.
There was no evidence to corroborate the Horizon evidence. There was no

proof of an actual loss as opposed to a Horizon-generated shortage.”

161. From the documents, it appears that the request for further disclosure was
taken seriously with the relevant information requested, but | acknowledge

that this was not available at the time of the Plea and Case Management

Page 51 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

Hearing. The case was not adjourned but instead, a basis of plea was

agreed meaning the case was concluded prior to any further disclosure

being obtained and disclosed which may have been relevant to the outcome

of this case. | cannot comment on the investigation process as this was

conducted by the Investigation and Security Team of which | was not

involved.

162.1 am saddened that Mr Wilson did not learn of his conviction being

overturned prior to him passing and extend my sympathies to his family for

the distress and loss that the conviction had upon them and Mr Wilson.

R -v- Seema Misra

163. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the case of Seema

Misra. To assist me in answering the Inquiry’s questions on this case, | have

considered the following documents:

vi.

The Audit Report dated 16 January 2008 (POL00058550);
The Investigation Report (POL00044541);

My memo to the Investigation Team dated 1 April 2008
(POL00049658);

The emails from April 2008 (POL000497 16);

My email dated 21 April 2008 (POL00049717);

My memo to the Fraud Team dated 18 November 2008

(POL00044539);

vii. | The Schedule of Charges against Seema Misra (POL00045010);
viii. | The Summary of Facts (POL00044613);

ix. The signed indictment (POL00051149).

164. The Inquiry have also provided me with the supplementary documents

listed below which | can confirm that | have reviewed:

i. |The correspondence involving Fujitsu legal (FUJ00152928,
FUJ00152935, FUJ00152936, FUJ00152937, FUJ00152938,
FUJ00152943, FUK00152948, FUJ00152950, FUJ00152954,
FUJ00152964, FUJ00152966, FUJ00152993, FUJ00153005,
FUK00153014 and FUJ00157863);

ii. My email dated 15 July 2010 (FUJ00153141);

iii. |The emails dated 5 February 2010 (FUJ00152940);
iv. The emails dated 8 February 2010 (POL0054051);

v. The emails dated 8 February 2010 (FUJ00153382);

vi. |The email sent on my behalf dated 8 February 2010 (FUJ00152958);
vii. | The email from Gareth Jenkins to me and the email chain below

(FUJ00152962) and attachment (POL00053992);

viii. | My email dated 24 February 2010 (FUJ00152985);

ix. |My emails dated 26 February 2010 (FUJ00152992);

x. |My email dated 3 March 2010 (FUJ00153019);

xi. The Audit Record Query (FUJ00155189);

xii. | Gareth Jenkins’ email dated 11 October 2010 (FUJ00153390);

xiii. | My memo dated 29 March 2010 (POL00119318);

Page 53 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

xiv. My email dated 1 July 2013 (FUJ00154223).

165. As with the other cases, my involvement with the case of Mrs Misra started
on receipt of the file, which would have been roughly two weeks before my
advice memo dated 1 April 2008 (POL00049658). Therefore, it is likely that

my involvement would have started around mid-March.

166. As with the other cases, | cannot recall what information | received prior to
giving this advice but refer the Inquiry to my comments in relation to Mr
Blakey as to what an ideal file should contain. | cannot remember and am
therefore unable to confirm whether or not any of the documents at

POL00094011 formed part of the information that | received.

167. The advice that | gave to the Investigation and Security Team is laid out in
my memo of 1 April 2008 (POL00049658). This states that in my opinion,
there is sufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction for the
charges. It notes that | have recommended a charge of theft of £74,609.84
in view of the fact the losses were accrued for a period of over a year. | also
suggested a charge of false accounting. | recommend that if Mrs Misra
pleaded Guilty to the false accounting than the prosecution in respect of the
theft is not proceeded with. | recommend that all relevant accounts and
documentation should be produced in full. My advice then lists further

statements which | think are needed.

Page 54 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

168.As with the other cases, my advice was based upon consideration and
application of the Code, including whether the prosecution of Mrs Misra was

in the public interest.

169. | believe that it was David Pardoe who authorised the prosecution of Ms

Misra. David Pardoe also made the charging decision in this case.

170. As to whether there was any disagreement between individuals within the
Investigation and Security Team or between me and the Investigation and
Security Team as to what the appropriate charges were, | can see from the
correspondence (POL00049716) that | have been asked whether | will be
changing my advice on the charges, to which | respond “No. Please
proceed as advised.” The final charges were always a subject of discussion
between teams and | cannot remember there being any specific

disagreement over the charges for Mrs Misra.

171.1 cannot recall being aware of any allegations made by Mrs Misra relating to
the reliability of the Horizon IT system when | advised the Investigation and
Security Team in April and November 2008. However, | have noted that
neither the Audit Report (POL00058550), nor the Investigation Report
(POL00044541) make reference to any issues with the Horizon IT system,
with the Investigation Report noting that Ms Misra attributes the losses to
staff theft. | believe that the issue was raised just before trial, causing an

adjournment of the trial.

Page 55 of 89
172.| have considered the letter dated 13 May 2009 (POL00051441) and the

emails dated 22 May 2009 (POL00051539). The letter of 13 May 2009

notes that Mrs Misra has indicated that she will plead Guilty to False

Accounting and Not Guilty to Theft. It requests Counsel's advice as to

WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

whether we should proceed on the account of theft as we have been unable

to locate the three employees who could speak to the count. Counsel's

subsequent email of 22 May 2009 advises that there is strong evidence to

proceed with the theft charge and we should not accept the plea. | recall

that it was felt that it would not be possible to pursue a Confiscation Order

without a theft conviction. Counsel also notes that the Defendant may have

given false details in relation to the whereabouts of the employees.

173.\In addition to the memo of 1 April 2008 (POL00049658), | have considered

the following documents:

The list of statements and evidence sent to me on 23 January 2009
(POL00050738);

The Schedule of Non-Sensitive Unused Material dated 23 January
2009 (POL00050750);

The Schedule of Sensitive Material dated 23 January 2009
(POL00050751);

My draft instructions to Counsel to settle indictment and advise on
evidence and brief for the Prosecution dated February 2009
(POL00044585) and the letter to Counsel's clerk dated 17 February

2009 (POL00050950);

Page 56 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

v. Counsel's email dated 10 March 2009 (POL00051092);
vi. My letter to the Castle Partnership dated 17 February 2009
(POL00050942);
vii. | The letter from the Castle Partnership dated 2 March 2009

(POL00051045).

174.1 cannot recall who the disclosure officer was in this case.

175. My role in relation to disclosure is the same as described in relation to Mr

Blakey.

176.1 would have reviewed everything handed to me, including the Schedule of
Non-Sensitive Unused Material dated 23 January 2009 and would have
considered my disclosure obligations at every stage of the proceedings as

part of my continuous duty.

177.Counsel would have advised on disclosure in response to my instructions in
February 2009. However, without the documents | cannot recall what this

would have said.

178.| have considered the attendance note dated 3 June 2009 (POL00051773).
The Inquiry have asked me to explain the circumstances in which the
challenge to the integrity of the Horizon IT system first arose in this case.
From my recollection, the challenge arose at trial and the defence material

only consisted of computer magazine articles describing issues with

Page 57 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

Horizon, although | do not recall being given a copy. The case was

therefore adjourned and directions were made for the Defence to take steps

to set out and instruct an expert. The case was then listed for a mention

hearing.

179.| have considered the email chain from August 2009 (POL00052202). It

appears that the email was sent to me on 4 August 2009 but then forwarded

to Phil Taylor on 11 August 2009 and so it is not clear what involvement |

had with this. The email within this chain from David Posnett on 4 August

2009 at 09:38 outlines the issues with obtaining the ARQ log showing

transaction data for the relevant period. It states that due to the size of the

ARQ request, he cannot authorise Fujitsu to proceed at this stage. The

email notes that the request from the Defence equates to approximately 31

ARQs and they have an annual allowance of 670 ARQs so the request

represents a large chunk of their quota. It also notes that they can only

request 60 ARQs a month, so the Defence request could be detrimental to

other Prosecution requests.

180.1 confirm that | have considered the following documents:

The letter from Coomber Rich dated 1 October 2009 (POL00052487)
and the enclosed application for disclosure (POL00052462) and further
request for disclosure (POL00058503);

The emails from December 2009 (POL00053723),

xx. | The Schedule of Non-Sensitive Unused Material dated 8 September
2010 (POL00055217) (the covering letter from Rob Wilson sending this
to the Defence is dated 15 September 2010 (POL00055236));

xxi. The emails dated 6 and 8 October 2010 (POL00055421).

181. The Inquiry have asked me to provide a full account of the disclosure
requests made by the Defence after the hearing on 2 June 2009 and the

Post Office’s response to those requests.

182. With reference to POL00053723, my view in December 2009 was that the
disclosure request which had been made by the Defence was very wide, not
focused and their relevance was not clear as this was not properly set out in

a Defence Case Statement.

183.1 cannot recall the extent to which | advised directly on the merits of the
disclosure request. | can recall that | sought Counsel’s input at this stage
and John Longman and Phil Taylor were also heavily involved. | believe that
Counsel advised as to what the parameters of the request should be and

we progressed accordingly.

184. The Defence's expert report raised a number of issues/question and in
order to respond, as stated above, | spoke to the Head of Legal at Fujitsu.
Fujitsu put forward Gareth Jenkins as the best person to assist and |

understand that he met with the Defence expert and also responded to the

Page 60 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

Defence expert’s report and email requests. He also gave evidence in Court

and was cross-examined by the Defence.

185. Document POL00044557 is the advice given by Counsel in January 2010
on the disclosure requests made by the Defence. The advice notes that
although we have been put on notice that the Defence are challenging the
reliability of Horizon, this has been done in very general terms, with no
Defence Statement served mentioning this issue. The advice states that our
response to the disclosure requests should raise this failing and request a
detailed Defence Case Statement which fully particularises any problems
with Horizon which are alleged and upon which the Defence will seek to rely
upon at trial. The advice note then goes through each disclosure request in

turn.

186. Juliet MacFarlane's raises a concern about paragraph 23 of Counsel's
Advice in her letter dated 2 February 2010 (POL00053954). Paragraph 23
of Counsel's Advice (POL00044557) notes that there is a Brief in the case
of Hosi which should be disclosed. From recollection, the case of Hosi was
one of Juliet MacFarlane’s cases. Her concerns appear to arise from the
fact the case was ongoing and therefore there was no determination of the

evidence and the expert evidence was in draft format.

187. Document POL00053849 is an attendance note which discusses disclosure
and confirms that Counsel have advised we should disclose everything we

can disclose at this stage. | cannot remember whether the report in the case

Page 61 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

of Hosi was disclosed. However, it looks like it was not. | understand in
January 2010 that there was still an issue with how wide the Defence
Request was but there was a willingness to disclose and work was ongoing

by Investigation Officer, John Longman, to process the request.

188. Beyond what is detailed in the documents listed above, | am not ina
position to comment, as | cannot recall, whether Counsel advised on the
further requests for disclosure made by the Defence after January 2010 as |

cannot remember.

189. Similarly, | am not in a position to comment on the position taken by the
Post Office in relation to the Defence disclosure requests insofar as they
related to data from the Horizon IT system or information about the Horizon
IT system. From my perspective, | believed that the Post Office understood
that in its capacity, as a Prosecuting Authority, it had responsibilities relating
to disclosure. From the perspective of the legal team, all cases were kept

under review, including the ongoing disclosure obligations.

190.1 have considered the email from Issy Hogg dated 1 March 2010
(POL00054248), the notification of fixture dated 2 March 2010
(POL00054275), the email from Warwick Tatford dated 8 March 2010 and
the draft skeleton argument (POL00054335 and POL00054346) and the

emails dated 11 and 16 March 2010 (POL00054430).

191.1 can recall reading the Defence argument but due to the passage of time, |

cannot recall what the arguments were in specific terms and do not feel that

| am able to add anything beyond what is contained in these documents.

192. In relation to the transcripts from 11 and 18 October 2010 (UKGI00014994

and UKGI00014845), there was a half-time submission and a pre-trial

submission. On both occasions, the Judge ruled that the case could be put

before the jury. The submissions are as per the two transcripts and again, |

do not feel that | am able to add anything beyond what is contained in these

documents.

193. In giving my account of Fujitsu’s involvement in these proceedings, | can

confirm that | have considered the following documents:

194.Penny Thomas worked for Fujitsu and, | understand, was the POL contact

for Fujitsu. She came to be involved in the proceedings when the

Page 65 of 89
195.

196.

197.

WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

Investigation Officer requested information from Fujitsu in order to respond

to the Defence expert report.

Penny Thomas said that we needed to follow the usual procedures for a
data request. | was conscious that this was a very slow procedure and so to
speed things up, | contacted Penny Thomas and she gave me the number
of David Jones, Head of Legal at Fujitsu. | explained the situation to him

and he identified Gareth Jenkins as an individual who had the appropriate

knowledge and experience to assist.

In normal circumstances, expert witnesses should be independent. | recall
that the input of an independent expert was considered but no suitable
expert was identified as nobody from outside of Fujitsu had suitable
knowledge of the Horizon system. As | have stated above, given that the
Horizon IT system was unique | felt that the questions from the Defence
should be answered by somebody who knew the system well. At all times,
the main consideration was which evidence would best assist the Court in
determining the issues in dispute. Mr Jenkins was originally brought in as a
witness of fact, who had in-depth knowledge of the system and was
therefore in a position to assist the Court in relation to the matters within his
knowledge. | recall that the Court effectively treated him as an expert

witness due to his qualifications, knowledge and experience of the system.

| never gave Mr Jenkins any formal instructions but | liaised with him on

certain issues to clarify points and to forward him information. It was John

Page 66 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

Longman, the Investigation Officer, who would ordinarily seek Mr Jenkins’

input in relation to issues raised by the Defence.

198. Initially, | did not consider Mr Jenkins to be acting as an expert but to be
brought in as a lay witness with technical knowledge who could respond to
matters raised by the Defence expert. | do not know what information was
given to Mr Jenkins as to his role as an expert or his duty to the Court. In
normal circumstances, when instructing an expert, | would provide this
information. However, this was an unusual case in that he was not regarded
by the prosecution as an expert witness but from recollection went on to be
treated as an expert by the court. | cannot recall who told him what his role

as an expert was but | believe that this may have been done by Counsel.

199.No explanation was given to me by anyone from Fujitsu or the Post Office
during the case of Mrs Misra of the position in relation to known bugs, errors

or defects in the Horizon IT system, past or current.

200.1 had limited contact with Mr Jenkins and am not in a position to comment
on any views that he expressed in relation to the disclosure being sought by
the Defence and the relevance of the material sought to the case. His main

point of contact was John Longman.

201. In respect of the email from David Jones to Roger Williams and David
Roberts dated 5 February 2010 (FUJ00122723), | was not aware at the time

that | was involved in Mrs Misra’s case that Fujitsu had concerns about the

Page 67 of 89
202.

203.

204.

WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

impact that “key issues about [Fujitsu’s] systems” might have on “relations
with POL if mishandled”. Had | known about this email or its content, | would
have wanted to know what the issues were. As a lawyer my main duty is to

the Court.

| do not think that any of the comments made by Mr Jenkins in his email
dated 1 March 2010 (POL00054250) were any different to the concerns
previously raised about the need for specific issues to be particularised by
the prosecution. Therefore, these comments did not have any influence on

me.

In relation to the requests for access made by the Defence on 22 July 2010
(UKGI00014898), | believe that this issue related to a separate incident
being reported and that the prosecution wished to adduce evidence in
relation to this. | recall that there was concern regarding the relevance of an
issue in a different branch being operated by different personnel to Mrs
Misra’s case. The request from the Defence was seen as too vague and, as
noted in my memo of 11 August 2010 (POL00055146), | state that we will
not provide this information and if the Defence wish to proceed with their

request, they can do so by means of a Section 8 application to the Court.

| have considered the document entitled “Correcting Accounts for “lost”
Discrepancies” starting at page 6 of POL00028838. | do not recall having
seen this document before the Inquiry provided it to me. If | had known

about this document, | would have passed it to the Investigation and

Page 68 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

Security Team to try and understand what it meant, the implications of it and
whether the problem was being resolved. Once it had been assessed, |

would have considered the disclosure test and disclosed it.

205.1 have considered the email from Mandy Talbot to me dated 8 October 2010
(POL000554 18). | do not recall any conversations with Mandy Talbot,
although there may have been a brief call immediately prior to her sending
this email. | was not involved in any wider briefings and, at the time, | did not

know who ‘Mike’ or ‘Rod’ were who are referred to in the email.

206.1 have considered my email dated 21 October 2010 (POL00055590) and my
memo to Post Office Security and others dated 16 November 2010
(POL00055759). At the time, | thought that the outcome of the case was a

success and | was relieved that the case was concluded.

207. There is a comment in my email that “it is hoped the case will set a marker
to dissuade other Defendants from jumping on the Horizon bashing
bandwagon”. | was asked to report back to the team and in doing so, |
commented on the outcome and the fact that the Defence’s criticisms of the
Horizon IT system were dealt with and that the prosecution case was made
out. | was aware that the case was of wider interest within the business and
my comment in relation to other cases was made with this in mind. The

wording of the email also had some input from Counsel.

Page 69 of 89
WITNO04750100

WITN04750100

208.1 have considered the Draft Order (POL00045051) and the telephone note
dated 22 February 2012 (POL00094048). My role in relation to criminal
enforcement proceedings against Mrs Misra was limited. | provided the
Directions to the Accredited Financial Investigation Team for the
confiscation proceedings. | would have also briefed Counsel on the case if
required but cannot recall whether or not | did. As can be seen from my
memo (POL00119318), | attended the Confiscation Hearing and reported

back on it.

209. My understanding of the issues and outcome in the Lee Castleton case did
not have any impact upon my assessment of Mrs Misra’s case, on the basis
that the evidence from Mr Jenkins dealt with the issue and he had explained
to the Court why the outcome in the Lee Castleton case was irrelevant to

the issues in Mrs Misra’s case.

210.1 have read the judgment of Josephine Hamilton and Others v Post Office
Limited [2021] (POL000113278), paragraphs 75, 91 and 198 to 209 and |
hope that | have answered the criticisms highlighted in this judgment in the

above.

211.In terms of my reflections now on the way that the investigation and
prosecution of Mrs Misra was conducted, | wish that the wrongful conviction
had not occurred but, at the time, | felt that the case was conducted

professionally based on the knowledge and information before us. | would

Page 70 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

like to extend my sympathies to Mrs Misra for the loss and distress that she

suffered due to the wrongful conviction.

Action against Joan Bailey

212. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the action taken

against Joan Bailey. To assist me in answering the Inquiry’s questions on

this case, | have considered the following documents:

vi.

vii.

viii.

The Audit Report dated 5 2011 (POL00055918);

The Record of Taped Interview dated 9 March 2011 (POL00056387
(part 1), (POL00056388 (part 2) and POL00056389 (part 3));

The record of forms / exhibits shown at interview (POL00056365);
The Investigation Report dated 11 April 2011 (POL00057198);

The memo from Maureen Moors to the Criminal Law Team dated 14
April 2011 (POL00056390);

My memo to Post Office Security dated 3 May 2011 (POL00056477);
My memo to Post Office Security dated 17 May 2011 (POL00056547);
The case closure report dated 1 December 2011 (POL00057282);
The Royal Mail Group Caution dated 23 November 2011
(POL00061539);

The case file event log (POL00057285).

213. To my knowledge, an audit, interview and investigation was done to

establish the cause of the ‘losses’ which had been occurring at the branch.

Page 71 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

My assessment of the case, based on the admissions made at interview,
was that the appropriate offences were fraud / false accounting. Taking into
account all of the factors in this case and applying the public interest test,
my assessment was that a caution was appropriate. Because no other
offences were being considered, it was not necessary as part of the legal
process, and therefore | did not, further investigate or consider whether the

losses in the branch might have been caused by the Horizon IT system.

214.1 do not recall whether any Horizon data (and in particular ARQ logs) were
requested from Fujitsu in relation to this case, but it is unlikely given the
decision to offer a caution on grounds of the admitted fraud. | do not know if
the Investigation and Security Team, as part of any wider consideration of

the matter, requested any information from Fujitsu.

215.| have no specific recollection of this case and therefore do not feel in a
position to provide any further reflections at this stage, other than to say that
| am, of course, sorry that action was incorrectly taken again Joan Bailey

and the loss and distress that this will have caused her.

R -v- Lynette Hutchings

216. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the case of Lynette

Hutchings. To assist me in answering the Inquiry’s questions on this case, |

have considered the following documents:

Page 72 of 89
vi.

vii.

WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

The handwritten note (POL00046065);

The Audit Report dated 31 March 2011 (POL00056292);

The Record of Tape Recorded Interview dated 20 April 2011
(POL00056417 (part 1),POL00044505 (part 2), POLO0046625 (part
3));

The Investigation Report dated 5 May 2011 (POL00046706);

My memo dated 17 June 2011 (POL00046626);

The memo from Graham Brander to you dated 9 December 2011
(POL00046628);

The Advice and Proposed Charge drafted by Martin Smith of

Cartwright King (POL00057362).

217.1 first became involved in the case of Mrs Hutchings on receipt of the file

which, based on the date of my memo (POL00046626), would have been

around early June 2011.

218. My initial assessment of the case and advice | gave is as per the memo

(POL00046626). This notes that concerns were raised that the Horizon

system was not working properly and therefore this needed to be

investigated before final advice can be given.

219.1 subsequently handed over the case to Martin Smith of CK, to take over.

The advice given from CK on prosecution and charges is at document

POL00057362. This states that there is very strong evidence to support the

allegation that Mrs Hutchings had inflated the amount of cash held within

Page 73 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

the branch. It notes that she admitted to altering the cash declarations and
suggested that she had done so only since the migration to Horizon but
prior to this, all accounts balanced. CK comment that this is clearly untrue.
CK advise that Mrs Hutchings gave examples of problems which she
alleged to have experienced with the Horizon system but these do not
appear to be of any relevance and no explanation has been put forward as

to how the deficit has arisen.

220. Following the advice, the Summons dated 21 February 2012
(POL00057468) were issued. | assume that CK’s advice was accepted by
the Information and Security Team and that they authorised the prosecution
based on this advice and their charging decision to prosecute on the fraud

charge was also based on CK’s advice.

221.My involvement with the matter at POL00057362 is purely administrative, in
that | was sent a statement from Graham Brander which | subsequently

forwarded to CK to deal with.

222.| have considered the documents provided to me by the Inquiry but, beyond
the initial advice, | was not involved in the case and therefore | am unable to
provide any meaningful answers to the Inquiry’s questions beyond what is

contained in the documents.

223.\n reflecting on the way the investigation and prosecution of Mrs Hutchings

was conducted by the Post Office and the outcome of the case, | have

Page 74 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

considered the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in Josephine Hamilton and
Others v Post Office Limited [2012] EWCA Crim 577 (POL00113278) (and

in particular paragraphs 267 to 272).

224.1 understand entirely the points made in the Hamilton judgment in relation to
there being no evidence or investigation into the Horizon IT system. At the
time of dealing with the case | made my views clear in my advice note that
more evidence was required to support the prosecution case. However, the
case was subsequently taken over by CK who reviewed the evidence and
advised on the appropriate charges. The defendant was advised by their
Solicitor and Counsel and duly advised on their plea. | am sorry that no
further evidence or investigation into Mrs Hutching’s concerns were made
and that this resulted her being wrongfully convicted. | extend my

sympathies for the loss and distress that this must have caused her.

R -v- Grant Allen

225. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the case of Grant
Allen. To assist me in answering the Inquiry’s questions on this case, | have

considered the following documents:

i. The Audit Report dated 2 February 2012 (POL00089081);
ii. |The Record of Taped Interview re. interview of 19 April 2012
(POL00089670 (part 1), POL00089671 (part 2));

iii. The Investigation report dated 1 May 2012 (POL00089426);

Page 75 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

iv. The email from Andrew Bolc dated 4 July 2012 (POL00089294) and
the attachments (POL00089454, POL00089057 and POL00089455).

v. Gareth Jenkins’ email dated 31 January 2013 (FUJ00153958).

226. At the outset | would like to flag that | had very limited involvement in the
case as it was CK who provided and reviewed the investigation report and

provided the initial advice.

227.My email dated 21 and 22 May 2012 (POL00089273) refers to various
lawyers giving advice: Simon Clark, Paul Wright, Martin Smith and Chris

Knight. | can confirm that these are CK lawyers.

228. | cannot now recall whether | conducted my own review of the documents
provided by the Investigation and Security Team in this case. However, it is
unlikely as it was the role of CK to advise the Investigation and Security

Team and | was only copied into correspondence for information purposes.

229.CK’s advice is provided at POL00089057. This notes that, subject to a
satisfactory answer in relation to the possibility of lost data, they would
advise a charge of fraud by false representation. It notes that there is
insufficient evidence to prove to the criminal standard who, if anyone,

actually stole the money from the Post Office.

Page 76 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

230. In consideration of what action was taken by the Post Office following the
advice from CK and what charges appeared on the final indictment, | have

reviewed the following documents:

i. The Summary of Facts (POL00089562);
ii. |The Summons dated 19 July 2012 at (POL00089072);
iii. | The unsigned witness statement of Stephen Bradshaw dated 1 May
2012 (POL00089560);
iv. The unsigned statements of Richard Cross and Andrew Wise dated 17
September 2012 and 1May 2012 respectively at (POL00089561);
v. The letter to me dated 8 August 2012 (POL00089477) and the email
dated 9 August 2012 (POL00089329);
vi. The letter from Stephen Bradshaw to Cartwright King dated 24
September 2012 (POL00089061);
vii. The list of witnesses (POL00089346) and the list of exhibits
(POL00089351);

vii. |The emails of 16 October 2014 (POL00089050).

231.Having reviewed these documents, | can see that following the advice,
Summons were issued to Mr Allen for the offence of: between 1 April 2010
and 7 February 2012, dishonestly and intending thereby to make a gain for
himself or another, or to expose another to a risk of loss, made
representations to Post Office Ltd, which were and which he knew were
untrue or misleading, namely that Winsford Post Office had more cash on

the premises than was actually the case resulting in a shortage of £11,705,

Page 77 of 89

234.

235.

WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

in breach of Section 2 of the Fraud Act 2006. The email dated 16 October

2014 (POL00089050) confirms the Mr Allen subsequently pleaded guilty.

In relation to the Schedule of Non-Sensitive Unused Material dated 19
September 2012 (POL00089348), the disclosure officer in this case was
Stephen Bradshaw and CK were responsible for reviewing the disclosure
schedules provided by Stephen as disclosure officer. | did not have any

involvement in the disclosure process.

In relation to the letter from Andrew Bolc of CK to Martin Bloor of Maidments
Solicitors dated 22 November 2012 (POL00089376), | have no recollection
of having seen this document before the Inquiry provided it to me and | had
no involvement in CK’s response. | was not involved in, and therefore
cannot comment on, whether any consideration was given to a stay or

adjournment of the Plea and Case Management Hearing.

Similarly, | do not know whether any call logs relating to calls made from Mr
Allen’s branch to the Horizon Service Desk and / or the Network Business

Support Centre for the relevant period were ever requested.

| have considered the emails dated 16 and 19 November 2012
(POL00089374). The Inquiry have asked me about the background to and
nature of the report which had been prepared by Gareth Jenkins, which was
proposed to be used in the cases identified by Rachael Panter. This report

dealt with the reliability of the Horizon system. | was not involved in any

Page 78 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

correspondence between CK and Gareth Jenkins in relation to the use of
this report. CK had care and conduct of the case and made the
determination that the report could be used across a number of cases. From
looking at the email chain, it appears that this was because it was a generic
report and not specific to one particular case. There was not, as far as | am
aware, any standard practice/process for using the same general

report/evidence across cases.

236.As to what my understanding was of the concerns which were being raised
by Fujitsu in this email chain (POL00089374), | can only comment on what
is contained in the email chain. Here, it appears that the concerns were
being raised largely in relation to the fact CK approached Mr Jenkins
directly, when asking him whether they could use his report for multiple
cases, as opposed to going through the usual process of contacting him

through a member of the Investigation Team.

237.1 can confirm that | have considered the following documents:

i. The emails dated 4 and 5 December 2012 (POL00089378) and 12
December 2012 (POL00089380);

iii. | The emails dated 5 and 19 December 2012 (POL00089390);
iv. The email from Gareth Jenkins dated 7 January 2013 (POL00089401);

v. The emails dated 31 January 2013 (POL00089427).

. | have been asked by the Inquiry to provide an account of Fujitsu’s

involvement in these proceedings.

| was not involved in, and therefore cannot comment on, how Mr Jenkins
came to be involved in these proceedings. However, it appears from the
documents that his involvement stemmed from CK finding in their
possession a report which comments on the reliability of the Horizon
system. Given that this report was generic in nature, CK determined that it
could be used in evidence in a number of cases where Horizon issues were

raised.

| was not involved in and therefore | did not have any say as to whether Mr
Jenkins acted as an expert or a witness to fact, but | assume that CK would
have wanted to have used him as an expert following the case against Mrs
Misra. | did not give Mr Jenkins any instructions and | do not know what

instructions he was given by CK.

| cannot recall whether Mr Jenkins ever conducted any analysis of the data

specific to the case of Mr Allen. Document POL00089380 notes that Mr

Jenkins said that he was able to retrieve the actual data from the time to see

Page 80 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

what actually occurred at this branch. However, | do not know whether this

was actually completed.

242. \t was for CK to decide whether Mr Jenkins should be instructed to examine
case specific data, both in this case and more generally. | have noted my
email of 1 February 2013 (POL00089427) where | ask whether we are in a
position to provide Horizon data to Mr Jenkins and seek his input. | cannot
recall the answer to this question and ultimately, it would have been a

decision for CK.

243.No information was given to me by anyone from Fujitsu (or the Post Office)
during the course of the criminal proceedings against Grant Allen as to any

bugs, errors, or defects in the Horizon IT system, past or present.

244. Document POL00089427 details Mr Jenkins’ concerns about the allegations
made in the Defence. | do not feel that | am able to comment further on this,
as | do not have any details of the allegation that he is referring to. As CK
had conduct of the case, | would not have had these details at the time
either and would have been copied in for information purposes only and

assumed that it would be dealt with by CK.

245.1 have seen that | advise on the acceptability of the basis of plea. | do not
know why and cannot recall why | would have got involved at this stage
when this would have been for CK, together with the Investigation Officer, to

consider as they would have had the background, knowledge and details of

Page 81 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

the case. | do not recall how it came for me to involved at this point. | can

only assume that | was asked because | was the POL criminal solicitor.

246. In reflecting now on the way the investigation and prosecution of Mr Allen
was conducted, | have reviewed the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in
Richard Hawkes & Others v Post Office Limited [2022] EWCA Crim 1197
(RLIT0000039) (and in particular at paragraphs 16 to 24). This highlights
the issues that sub postmasters were experiencing with Horizon. Had |
known any of this information at the time, | am confident that the
investigation and prosecution of Mr Allen, as with other sub postmasters
would have been conducted differently, or not at all. | am sorry that the
absence of this evidence resulted in the wrongful conviction of Mr Allen and

the loss and distress that this must have caused him.

R -v- Angela Sefton and R -v- Anne Nield

247. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the cases of

Angela Sefton and Anne Nield.

248. My involvement in these cases was very limited as CK had complete
conduct of the prosecutions from initial advice through to conclusion. |
therefore cannot comment on the action taken, including the charges,
witness evidence or disclosure. | have read and reviewed the documents
provided to me by the Inquiry in relation to these cases but do not feel | can

add anything further than what is contained in these documents.

Page 82 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

249.1 have seen that | was sent an email from CK (POL000059313) asking me

for an update on Insight2 (Second Sight) Report. Second Sight were

brought in to review the prosecutions of the sub postmasters and were

drafting a report which reviewed the Horizon system. | understand that the

Defence solicitors were asking for this and CK’s email was simply asking

me for an update as to the report so that they could update the Defence.

Other than this, | do not recall being involved in this case.

250. However, as with all of the cases, | understand the extent of the loss and

distress that Ms Sefton and Ms Nield must have suffered and extend to

them my sympathies.

R v Khayyam Ishaq

251. The below deals with my recollection and involvement in the case of

Khayyam Ishaq. To assist me in answering the Inquiry’s questions on this

case, | have considered the following documents:

vi.

Martin Smith’s email dated 31 May 2012 (POL00119452);

The emails from February 2013 (POL00059808);

Rachael Panter’s email dated 4 February 2013 (FUJOO153967);
My email dated 6 February 2013 (POL00119434);

Martin Smith’s email dated 8 March 2013 (POL00119381);

My email dated 31 July 2013 (POL00119407).

Page 83 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

252. As can be seen in the above documents, as the only Criminal Lawyer at the

POL, | was copied into this case for information only. | had no involvement

in the actual prosecution of the case of Mr Ishaq and do not feel that | am

able to expand on anything other than that contained in the documents.

253. However, | would like to extend my sympathy to Mr Ishaq for the loss and

distress that he suffered due to the Horizon IT system.

Audit data from Horizon to support investigation, prosecution and/or other

legal proceedings

254. In considering the Inquiry’s questions in relation to the above subject matter,

| can confirm that | have reviewed the following documents:

The document entitled “Conducting Audit Data Extractions at CSR”
dated 4 May 2000 (POL00029176);

The document entitled “Conducting Audit Data Extractions at Live”
dated 27 November 2001 (FUJ0015276);

The versions of the document entitled “Management of the Litigation
Support Service” dated 27 October 2009 (FUJ00152212), 14 February
2012 (FUJ00152220) and 23 April 2012 (FUJ00152225) as well as the
version marked “withdrawn” (FUJ00152235);

The versions of the document entitled “Audit Data Extraction Process”

dated 13 September 2010 (FUJ00152216), 1 March 2011

Page 84 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

(FUJ00152218), 14 February 2012 (FUJ00152221), 3 September 2014
(FUJ00152225) and 4 September 2014 (FUJ00152229);

v. The document entitled “Security Management Service: Service
Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0017) dated 24 August 2006
(FUJ00002033), 31 December 2008 (FUJ00080107), 15 October 2010
(FUJ00002264), 25 November 2013 (FUJ00088868), 4 December
2013 (FUJ00002555), 4 April 2014 (POL00002572) and 19 February

2016 (POL00002666) (in particular paragraph 2.4).

255. My role as a member of the CLT did not include dealing with any contractual
requirements between Fujitsu and POL. This was dealt with by a

contract/commercial team and was not part of my responsibilities.

256. The only role | had in obtaining audit data was to request it as and when it
was required through the Investigation and Security Team as happened in
the case of Mrs Misra. The Investigation Officer would deal with the request
internally and contact Fujitsu. In the case of Mrs Misra | contacted David
Jones, Head of Legal, direct to escalate the request but it was primarily for
the Investigation Officer to deal with requests. It was not usual for me to
contact David Jones at Fujitsu but | did so here, due to the urgency of the
request. | only obtained his name from Penny Thomas who provided it to
me so that | could try to bypass the usual slow procedure for obtaining ARQ

data.

Page 85 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

257.\n normal circumstances, | understand that David Jones in Fujitsu would be
negotiating and communicating about ARQ requests with our contract and
commercial team. | was not part of these negotiations and cannot comment
on who was also responsible for the provision of data or how any data was

obtained was presented by Fujitsu.

ARQ data issues

258. In answering the Inquiry’s questions on this subject matter, | can confirm

that | have reviewed the following documents:

i. | Mark Dinsdale’s email to Marilyn Benjamin and Juliet McFarlane dated
2 July 2010 (FUJ00122903);
ii. | The emails between Juliet McFarlane and Mark Dinsdale dated 13 and

16 September 2010 (FUJ00122980).

259. The first time that | had sight of these two emails was when the Inquiry
provided them to me. | did not see them or have any knowledge or them
during the time when | was involved in prosecutions of subpostmasters.
Given that this is my first time seeing these emails, | do not feel in a position
to answer the Inquiry’s questions on them as | do not feel that | could

expand on anything other than what is stated in the emails.

The creation and development of standard Horizon Integrity reports

260. In addressing the Inquiry’s questions on the above subject matter, | can

ii. |My email dated 20 September 2012 (FUJ00155085);

x. | Gareth Jenkins’ email to Martin Smith, me and others dated 5 October

FUJ00124016, FUJ00080526, FUJ00124020);

261.Document POL00096983 refers to two ‘existing’ reports called ‘Horizon’ and
‘Horizon Online Integrity’. | cannot recall the specifics of these reports but
presume that they were generic reports, giving information both about how
the Horizon system operated and worked in practice and also about the
integrity of the Horizon system. | understand that CK requested them
because they wanted a report to be able to serve with all cases which
assisted the Court and the Defence in understanding the working of the

Horizon system in practical terms.

262.1 then requested another report. This was to assist Helen Rose, the
disclosure officer, who was, at that time, dealing with 20 cases. The report
was needed to deal with the issues in those cases. This email and the
questions in it, were drafted following consultation with and assistance from

CK.

263. By this point, | did think that Mr Jenkins was providing evidence as an

expert as he was seen as an expert by both POL and Fujitsu.

General

264.1 did consider that a challenge to the integrity of Horizon in one case was

relevant to other ongoing or future cases but | would also always deal with

the specific issues in each case in front of me on a case by case basis.

Page 88 of 89
WITNO04750100
WITN04750100

265. Counsel were very experienced and had training on the Horizon system and
dealt with multiple POL cases. If they were aware that an issue raised in
one case was or could be relevant to another case, | was confident that they

would highlight this to me in their opinions and advice.

266.1 cannot think of any other matters that | consider are of relevant to Phase 4
of the Inquiry (Action against Sub-postmasters and others: policy making,
audits and investigations, civil and criminal proceedings, knowledge of and

responsibility for failures in investigation and disclosure).

267.1 have a lot of sympathy for these sub postmasters and the huge amount of
loss they suffered. | genuinely thought that | was doing the right thing at the
time. They are not criminals and | am sorry that the legal system failed them

and treated them as such.

Statement of Truth

| believe the content of this statement to be true.
