BUSINESS SOLUTION DESIGN ENHANCED USER HELP AND SUPPORT V2.0

Management Summary

1.1. Business Problem

On-line Help is currently not regarded as the first port of call for branches to resolve customer/product queries due to the clunkiness of the functionality
and the lack of a search engine. Branches default to ringing the NBSC. This results in:

1. A poor in-branch experience for customers as they wait for the postmaster to obtain the answer from the helpline.

2. Increase costs into Support Services as they manage high call volumes.

1.2. Drivers for Change

The Branch Technology Transformation Programme has made the decision to retain and evolve the existing Horizon functionality provided by Fujitsu.

Prior to this decision a procurement exercise was performed during which a number of requirements and improvement opportunities were captured and
shared with potential bidders. These, along with recommendations from Project Sparrow and the Branch Support Programme have formed the basis of the
driver for change and have been discussed in workshops with stakeholders and SME’s which has resulted in the requirements documentation being
produced (See Section 3).

The purpose of this document is to:-
« Ensure the business and programme stakeholders can:
o Clearly communicate to a technology service provider what the solution needs to do to satisfy the customer's and business’ needs
© Provide input into the design phase with the supplier
« Define the scope of the work package
e Detail the business requirements.
1.3. Summary of Findings

The solution should provide:

+ An intuitive search engine that enables the in-branch user to quickly get to the information they need therefore building the trust of branches in the
content and encouraging self-service

+ Organise information in such a way that it facilitates the smooth running of branches in recognition that branches are busy and their primary focus
should be providing excellent service to our customers.

+ The ability to publish information instantly (subject to internal approval) to ensure help content is current

+ Strengthened business processes which ensure help content is owned and managed.

+ Management information down to branch and user level which allows an understanding of how help is being used

1.4. Recommendations

4.4.1, Impact on Core Operating Processes & Management & Support Services

Customer Positive + Quicker responses in branch to resolve customer queries or complete transactions
compared to ringing through the NBSC. XX% of calls into NBSC are where the branch
has a customer waiting at the counter [ST - Awaiting figures from KD]

Cost Positive + Initial high-level estimate of 10 FTE savings if Online Help can be delivered alongside
product simplification and branch uptake of the self service options is encouraged and
supported by the business

Efficiency Positive + Simpler publishing and maintenance of Online Help content, including the ability to
(Simpler To Run) publish content instantly to branches

+ Utilising Online Help to actively assist Manager/Postmaster in the management of their
branch (e.g. using weekly task lists)

Controls Positive + Better control of Online Help content, with audit trail and approval for all changes and an
easily accessible archive to view content that was live at a particular point in time

+ Management information about Online Help usage at a branch and user level giving an
understanding of which branches are using the system, the areas which need
improvement and providing support on any potential mediation cases

+ Meets one of the Project Sparrow recommendations

1.5. Next Steps

Enhanced User Help and Support is one of the Candidate Opportunities that the BTTP wish to take into Release 1. This outline document will be presented

to the Senior User Forum followed by the Solution Design Authority for assessment and shall be a part of the Summary for Approval pack.

1.6. Owner

This document is owned by Dawn Brooks who is responsible for approval of this document and all related feedback should be directed to them.

2. Business Context

There is an operational need to provide transactional and procedural information to support branches when completing their day to day tasks. It is
essential that branches have instant access to the information and answers can be quickly retrieved, especially if this is to complete a transaction whilst a
customer is waiting. The information must be kept up to date to ensure branches do not follow incorrect or out of date procedures, which may have a
financial impact on the branch.

2.1. Background

2.2. Business Problem
2.2.1. Problem Statement

On-line Help is currently not regarded as the first port of call for branches with customer/product queries due to the clunkiness of the functionality and the
lack of a search engine. Branches default to ringing NBSC resulting in a poor in-branch experience for customers as they wait for the postmaster to obtain

Ability to access transactions screens to enable guidance to be provided to users
on specific problems

This has to be the easiest feature to use so that the best support is available.

Search is useless.

An area of the screen should be dedicated to tips/important information on the
relevant transaction, for instance country specific mail rules, transaction
requirements etc.

Horizon Help is hopeless, merely typing out paper manual onto a computer does
not provide a useful help system. Replace with something similar to the many
wiki available online (you do not have to allow everyone to alter it) and use the
structure as a guide i.e. pages, the way they are linked and information is
presented.

Ticket based/email help system for non urgent enquires direct through horizon.

Helpline Page — Requires overall updating and made more ‘user friendly’ (certain
processes need to be checked internally, for accuracy before transference of
data) A bookmarking facility would be helpful to aid easier navigation. In respect
of dangerous good procedure the information could be presented in an improved
format (on similar lines to RMDG3 Business booklet, which for instance uses a
table to show exceptions to the rule; in respect of electronic items containing
lithium batteries.)

On-line help is too long winded — can’t find what you are looking for e.g. stock
codes or answers to difficult mails questions. Need a search facility similar to

Google

Not very helpfull!
*needs more info about how to put things right rather than how to do the
transaction. If I make a mistake there is nothing that shows me how to correct it.

Not user friendly
*could be vastly improved with instant messaging or direct link to a helpline
advisor

Currently cannot read instructions and carry out the transaction
* need to be able to see both at the same time.

Each section of the new help solution will have a business owner, who will be responsible for creating and maintaining the content on an on-going basis to

ensure it remains up to date.

2.3.2. Out of Scope

2.4, Problem Impact on Business

The following issues exist with Online Help today:

The help solution is not content driven i.e. if a user is having problems with a specific transaction / part of the system, the help is not completely
tailored to the problem the user is having. The current help solution isn’t contextualised sensitive help — i.e. you can’t search by key words - you
end up at a main menu from which you then have to select the correct topic.

There is no clear business owner for each of the sections of Online Help today (Changes not necessarily made to the exact request of the Product
Manager)

Branches don't use it because it's not user friendly

Unable to report on how help is used (to support with on-going training)

Not one version of the truth - various systems hold different information (Knowledge Base, Horizon Help)
Cannot view help / horizon at the same time

The current solution is not intuitive

Help is not updated consistently, many sections of help haven’t been updated for 12 months plus

No instantaneous publishing (requirement for real-time content management)

Can only change once a week, can only change a certain number of cases/characters/pages

The current browser doesn’t scroll. (We are only allowed text and images in the content pages (no scripting); the lack of scripting on the web pages
greatly hinders the development of a better user experience such as improvements to site navigation and organisation of content.)

Whenever changes are made to help content today they are not version controlled.

In order to view help within Horizon today, you have to abandon any transaction that you are currently doing and start the transaction again, once
you have exited help. This not only wastes time for the counter colleague but more importantly the customer.

As part of the move to the new help solution, all current help Open
content will be re-written by the product owners and Risk 04

below will help to mitigate the content going out of date.

Each section of help on the new solution will have a dedicated Open

business owner who will be responsible for ensuring the content
remains up to date. New Operational procedures will be put in
place to ensure this happens.

Once this BSD has been signed off by the Senior Sign-Off
stakeholders there will be a session organised with Fujitsu to
discuss our requirements.
