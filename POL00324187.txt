If a claim or demand is made or action brought to which Clause 18.1 may apply or in
the reasonable opinion of Fujitsu Services is likely to be made or brought, Fujitsu
Services may at its own expense either:

18.6.1 modify any or all of the Horizon Service Infrastructure or the documentation or
the Services (as the case may be) without reducing the performance and
functionality of the same, or substitute alternative products or services of
equivalent performance and functionality for any or all of the Horizon Service
Infrastructure or the documentation or the Services (as the case may be), so as
to avoid the infringement or the alleged infringement but without disrupting the
performance of the Services, provided that the terms herein shall apply mutatis
mutandis to such modified or substituted items or services and such modified
or substituted items shall be acceptable to Post Office (whether by passing any
form of acceptance testing or otherwise), such acceptance not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, and shall reimburse Post Office all
reasonable costs directly incurred by them; or

18.6.2 procure a licence to use the Horizon Service Infrastructure or the
documentation or Services (as the case may be) on terms which afford to Post
Office no more extensive rights than those originally applicable hereunder and
which are acceptable to Post Office and shall reimburse Post Office all
reasonable costs directly incurred by it.

The foregoing provisions of this Clause 18 shall not apply insofar as any such claim or
demand or action is in respect of:

18.7.1 any use by or on behalf of Post Office of the Horizon Service Infrastructure or
the documentation or Services (as the case may be) in combination with any
item not supplied or approved (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) by Fujitsu Services where such use of the Horizon Service
Infrastructure or the Listed Documentation or Services (as the case may be)
directly gives rise to the claim, demand or action; or

18.7.2 any modification carried out by or on behalf of Post Office to any item supplied
by Fujitsu Services under this Agreement if such modification is not authorised
by Fujitsu Services in writing; or

18.7.3 any use by Post Office of the Horizon Service Infrastructure or the
documentation or Services (as the case may be) in a manner not reasonably to
be inferred from the specification or requirements of Post Office.

If Fujitsu Services has availed itself of its rights to modify the Horizon Service
Infrastructure or the documentation or the Services (as the case may be) or to supply
substitute products or services pursuant to Clause 18.6.1 (or Post Office has
unreasonably withheld its acceptance of such substitute products or services) or to
procure a licence under Clause 18.6.2 and such exercise of the said rights has avoided
any claim, demand or action for infringement or alleged infringement, or if Post Office

action.

If a modification or substitution in accordance with Clause 18.6.1 above is not possible
so as to avoid the infringement and Fujitsu Services has been unable to procure a
licence in accordance with Clause 18.6.2, Clause 18.1 shall apply.

Post Office hereby warrants and represents that any instructions given in relation to
Fujitsu Services’ use of any third party item supplied directly or indirectly by Post Office
shall not cause Fujitsu Services to infringe any third party's Intellectual Property Rights
in such item. Post Office shall, to the extent reasonably possible, assign to Fujitsu
Services any indemnity in its favour in relation to the Intellectual Property Rights in
such third party items.

The foregoing states the entire liability of Fujitsu Services with regard to the

The decision of Post Office as to whether any person is to be refused admission to any
premises occupied by or on behalf of the Post Office Group or to a Branch shall be final
and conclusive.

FUJITSU SERVICES’ KEY PERSONNEL

The Parties acknowledge that the Key Personnel are essential to the fulfilment of
Fujitsu Services’ obligations hereunder.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Clause 50, Post Office shall keep the CCD
entitled “Fujitsu Services Key Personnel” (HR/CON/001) confidential in accordance
with the provision of Schedule 6.

Fujitsu Services undertakes to use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Key
Personnel are not removed or replaced for the duration of the activities relevant to
them (described as “Tasks” in the CCD entitled “Fujitsu Services Key Personnel”
(HR/CON/001). However, in the event that any of the Key Personnel become
unavailable for any reason (including without limitation death, injury, sickness,
promotion or resignation), Fujitsu Services shall have the right upon giving thirty (30)
days’ notice in writing (or such shorter period of notice as may be reasonably
practicable) to Post Office to replace such an individual with another individual whose
abilities and qualifications are appropriate for the services to be performed by such
individual.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that in order for Fujitsu Services to successfully
complete its obligations under this Agreement, additional key personnel may be
identified after the date of this Agreement. It shall be a responsibility of the Forums to
identify and agree any such additional key personnel (together with any activities which
are relevant to them).

LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND POST OFFICE ADDITIONAL COST

Fujitsu Services shall pay Post Office liquidated damages and Post Office Additional
Costs (such payment to be in the form of credit notes unless Post Office directs

Management Report for the period to which the liquidated damages relate and Post
Office Additional Costs within thirty (30) days of the Parties agreeing the amount of the
same.

The Parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages referred to in this Clause are a
reasonable and genuine pre-estimate of the loss likely to be suffered by Post Office.

Without prejudice to Clause 34.2 and paragraph 7 of Schedule 15:

29.4.1 liquidated damages payable in respect of any LDT failure (which is not an ARL
failure to which paragraph 2.5.2 applies), whether that LDT failure occurs at,
above or below the corresponding SLT, shall be Post Office’s exclusive remedy
in respect of any failure of that LDT and/or SLT; and

29.4.2 Post Office's Additional Costs or liquidated damages payable in respect of any
ARL failure shall be Post Office’s exclusive remedy in respect of that failure.

INJURY TO PERSONS; LOSS OF PROPERTY

Subject always to Post Office's proper observance of its obligations under this Clause,
Fujitsu Services shall fully indemnify Post Office in respect of any personal injury or
loss of or damage to Property incurred by Post Office, its contractors or their respective
employees and authorised agents to the extent that such personal injury or loss of
Property is caused by any Default of Fujitsu Services, its employees or agents in
connection with the performance or purported performance of this Agreement.

In the event of any claim or demand being made or action brought to which Clause
30.1 applies, Fujitsu Services shall be promptly notified thereof and Fujitsu Services
shall at its own expense conduct all negotiations for settlement of the same and any
legal proceedings that may arise therefrom. Fujitsu Services shall consult with and pay
due regard to the interests (including the commercial interests of the Post Office Group
and the public interest) and views of Post Office in the conduct of any defence to any
claim or demand hereunder, and shall, where it is reasonable to do so, comply with
such interests and views. Post Office, its employees and agents, shall at the request of
Fujitsu Services afford all reasonable assistance for the purpose of contesting any such
claim or demand or action and shall be repaid any reasonable expense incurred in so
doing and shall not make any admissions which may be prejudicial to the defence of
such claim or demand or action.

Notwithstanding Clause 30.2, Post Office shall have the option to take over the conduct
over any claim, demand or action to which this Clause applies. Should Post Office
exercise the aforementioned option it shall indemnify Fujitsu Services against any loss,

Office prior to Post Office exercising its option) at which Fujitsu Services was prepared
to settle said claim, demand or action.

LIABILITY

Subject to the remaining sub-clauses of this Clause 31, Fujitsu Services shall be liable
for all losses and shall indemnify Post Office against all costs, expenses, losses and
damages incurred, including any legal costs (together referred to in this Clause 31 only

If and to the extent that Fujitsu Services proves that any of the matters referred to in
Clause 31.1 have been caused by Post Office's non-performance of any of its
obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement upon the performance of which
Fujitsu Services’ obligations depend the provisions of Clause 31.1 shall not apply. The
foregoing is in place of the general rule stated in Clause 26.3.

Where an act of fraud relates to the PostShop Solution, Clause 31.1.4 shall not apply
unless the fraud in question was perpetrated by a:

31.3.1 person who was at the time in question an employee, agent or sub-contractor of
Fujitsu Services (or an employee or agent of its sub-contractors);

31.3.2 third party whose fraudulent actions resulted from or were made possible by
Fujitsu Services’ failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

In the case of NBS or in relation to the operation of the NBS, Clause 31.1.4 shall not

to the extent that such loss, theft or compromise or such costs, expenses, losses, or
damages arise as a result of the fraud or Default of Fujitsu Services or of its
employees, agents or subcontractors.

In this Clause 31, the "Information Condition" means that the person concerned either:

In this Clause 32, the “POL FS Services Charge” for a Financial Year means the sum
of the POL FS Services elements of (i) the Operational Charge and (ii) the SI Support
Services component of the SI Commitment Fee in that Financial Year. Subject to
Clause 32.1, the aggregate liability of Fujitsu Services under the SAP RTU (including,

32.11.1 subject to Clause 32.11.2, the annual POL FS Services Charge shall be
deemed to be £1,200,000 unless the Parties agree a different amount under a
CCN; and

POL FS Services Charge in that Financial Year, and that Financial Year only,
shall be deemed to be the aggregate of:

32.11.2.1 that proportion of the POL FS Services Charge amount stated in
Clause 32.11.1 immediately prior to such amendment as the
number of days in that Financial Year prior to the date of such
amendment bears to 365; and

32.11.2.2 that proportion of the POL FS Services Charge amount stated in
Clause 32.11.1 immediately following such amendment as the
number of days remaining in that Financial Year on and after the
date of such amendment bears to 365.

The liability of Fujitsu Services in connection with the SAP RTU is as set out in Clauses
32.10 and 32.11 and paragraph 22 of the SAP RTU. In the event and only to the extent
of any conflict between: (i) Clauses 32.10 and 32.11 and paragraph 22 of the SAP

of liquidated damages and not by way of penalty the Solicitation Fee.

Nothing in this clause is intended to prevent or frustrate the right of any individual to
seek employment as he thinks fit.

FORCE MAJEURE

For the purposes of this Agreement the expression "Force Majeure" shall mean any
cause affecting the performance by a Party hereto of its obligations arising from acts,
events, omissions, happenings or non-happenings beyond its reasonable control
including (but without limiting the generality thereof) (i) Governmental Regulations
(subject to Clause 49.7), (ii) fire, (iii) flood, or (iv) any disaster or an industrial dispute
affecting a third party. Any act, event, omission, happening or non-happening will only
be considered Force Majeure if it is not attributable to the wilful act, neglect or failure to
take reasonable precautions of the affected Party, its agents or employees, and only if
a substitute third party is not reasonably available (having regard, without limitation, to
the cost and quality of such substitute) to perform the affected obligation. In no event
shall any fraudulent act or omission by any third party or Party in relation to the
Services for which Fujitsu Services is liable under Clause 31.1 constitute a force
majeure event.

Neither Party hereto shall in any circumstances be liable to the other Party hereto for
any loss of any kind whatsoever including but not limited to any damages or abatement
of Charges whether directly or indirectly caused to or incurred by the other Party by
reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement which is due to Force Majeure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party
shall use all reasonable endeavours to continue to perform, or resume performance of,
such obligations under this Agreement for the duration of such Force Majeure event. In
the case of Fujitsu Services, the Parties shall agree an orderly process for such
continuation or resumption of performance (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), and Fujitsu Services shall comply with such process. Fujitsu
Services shall remain liable to perform the Business Continuity Services, save where
such Business Continuity Services are themselves also affected by Force Majeure, in
which case Fujitsu Services shall be required to use all reasonable endeavours to
perform such Business Continuity Services.

If Fujitsu Services shall become aware of circumstances of Force Majeure which give
rise to or which are likely to give rise to any such failure or delay on its part it shall
forthwith notify Post Office within one (1) Working Day and shall inform Post Office of
the period which it is estimated that such failure or delay shall continue. If Post Office
shall become aware of circumstances of Force Majeure which give rise to any such
failure or delay on its part, it shall forthwith notify Fujitsu Services within one (1)
Working Day and shall inform Fujitsu Services of the period which it is estimated that
such failure or delay shall continue.

50.13

It is expressly agreed that any failure by Fujitsu Services to perform, or any delay by
Fujitsu Services in performing, its obligations under this Agreement which results from
any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations by any person, firm or
company with which Fujitsu Services shall have entered into any contract, supply
arrangement or sub-contract or otherwise shall be regarded as a failure or delay due to
Force Majeure only in the event that such person firm or company shall itself be
prevented from or delayed in complying with its obligations under such contract, supply
arrangement or sub-contract or otherwise as a result of circumstances of Force
Majeure and there is no substitute person, firm or company reasonably available
(having regard, without limitation, to the cost and quality of such substitute) to perform
the affected obligation.

If any Force Majeure event prevents any Party from performing its obligations
hereunder for a period in excess of ninety (90) consecutive days, Post Office may after
consulting with Fujitsu Services and taking into account Fujitsu Services’ views,
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Clause 34.1.5.

Extension of Time

If the performance of this Agreement by either Party be delayed by reason of any Force
Majeure event (as defined in Clause 49.1), both Parties shall be entitled to a
reasonable extension of time subject to there being no entitlement to any additional
costs or expenses incurred as a result of the delay. The Party so delayed shall notify
the other Party in writing within one (1) Working Day of becoming aware of the Force
Majeure event.

Political Risk

Notwithstanding the provisions of Clauses 49.1 to 49.5, a change of, or new,
Governmental Regulation:

49.19.1 shall not entitle Post Office to terminate this Agreement under Clause 49.5, and
any such purported termination shall be treated as a termination for
convenience in accordance with Clause 34.6; and

49.19.2 shall not require Fujitsu Services to perform any additional obligations, or any
reduced or modified obligations resulting in increased cost to Fujitsu Services,
without its agreement in accordance with the Change Control Procedure.

CONFIDENTIALITY

Without prejudice to the application of the Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989 (where
relevant) to any Confidential Information Fujitsu Services acknowledges that any
Confidential Information (other than its own Confidential Information) obtained from or
relating to Post Office, or its servants or agents, is the property of Post Office.

under no obligation restricting its disclosure;

50.14.13 which is independently developed without access to the Confidential
Information; and

50.14.14 as may be required under the FOIA or the EIR, in respect of which
paragraph 2.9 of schedule 2 shall apply.

in relation to the provision of services equivalent to the Services. Post Office shall
ensure that prior to any Confidential Information being disclosed to any such potential
Next Supplier, such potential Next Supplier shall enter into an Agreed Form NDA and
shall immediately inform Fujitsu Services if it has reason to believe that the potential
Next Supplier is in breach of the undertakings contained in that confidentiality
agreement.

50.16.1 each Party (and any person employed or engaged by it in connection with this
Agreement in the course of such employment or engagement) shall only use
Confidential Information of the other Party for the purposes of this Agreement;

50.16.2 each Party receiving Confidential Information from the other Party shall take all
necessary precautions to ensure that no Confidential Information of the other
Party is used other than for the purposes of this Agreement by the receiving
Party's employees, servants, agents or sub-contractors including, without
limitation, obtaining from any such agent or sub-contractor a signed
confidentiality undertaking on substantially the same terms as are contained in
this Clause; and

50.16.3 without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing:

50.16.3.1 neither Fujitsu Services nor any person engaged by Fujitsu Services
(whether as a servant or a consultant or otherwise) shall use the
Confidential Information of Post Office for the solicitation of
business from any third party or away from Post Office; and

50.16.3.2 Post Office may discharge the obligation imposed on it by Clause

Clause relates to individuals who are provided to the Post Office to
perform the tasks of Post Office employees under a framework

(such individuals being referred to in this Clause as “Contractors”)
by including within such Framework Agreement:

(i) an obligation of confidentiality in respect of Fujitsu Services’
Confidential Information which shall be binding on such third
party and each Contractor and continue in effect until at least
three years after the Framework Agreement is terminated or
expires; and

(ii) a provision requiring all of Fujitsu Services’ Confidential
