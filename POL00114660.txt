Dear Steve and Mark,

POL00114660

re AD

POL00114660
POL00114660

lease find attached a letter which we have received from Messrs. Musa Patels today enclosing an
=ddendum Defence Case Statement.

I note that the Addendum DCS sets out the reference numbers of numerous reports which the
defendant apparently made. It is the last working day before the trial and am I somewhat
suspicious that the information was not disclosed at an earlier stage. Steve, could you please go
through the Addendum DCS and make such enquiries as you are able to today.

So far as the letter itself is concerned, I note that Musa Patels confirm which witnesses are
required to give oral testimony.

Ihave no intention of providing details of previous cases in which there has been "an
unsuccessful challenge" to Horizon. That information does not undermine the Crown's case or
assist the Defence.

Steve, so far as Dennis Watson is concerned, could he prep a brief S9 which we could serve witha
NAE? Would he be available on Monday to attend court?

Kind Regards,

Martin.
