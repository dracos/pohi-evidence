Welcome to The Code

It outlines the expectations we have for
how we act and how we make decisions

It sets out what we stand for, the
principles we hold ourselves accountable
to, and what we expect from every single
person working for and with Post Office,
helping us all make informed decisions
and good choices.

And if I am a manager, I will also:
