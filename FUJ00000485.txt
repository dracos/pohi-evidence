THIS SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT, being Change Control Note (CCN) 550, is made
the 20th day of August 1999

BETWEEN:

(1)

Post Office Counters Ltd whose registered office is situated at
Gavrelle House, 2-14

Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8HQ (“POCL”); and

(2) ICL Pathway Limited whose registered office is at 26 Finsbury Square,
London EC2A
1DS (“the Contractor”)

RECITALS

WHEREAS :

(A) This Supplemental Agreement is supplemental to the Codified Agreement
between the parties dated 28th July, 1999 and constitutes CCN 550 of
that agreement.

(B) The Contractor and POCL have been carrying out the Operational Trial
and the other Acceptance Procedures in accordance with the Codified
Agreement.

(Cc) It is agreed that as at the end of the CSR Operational Trial Review

Period (16 August 1999) there were:-

9 faults (the “Agreed Category B Faults”) which both parties agree

are medium

severity (category (b)) faults (A.I.
390, 395, 314 and 408);

342, 361, 371, 211, 372,

3 faults (the “Disputed Category A Faults”) which the Contractor
considers to be category (b) faults but which POCL believes are

high severity (category (a)) faults (A.I.’s: 376, 298 and 218);

2 faults (the “Disputed Category B Faults”) which the Contractor
considers to be of

low severity but which POCL believes are category (b) faults

s: 378 and 391);

1 alleged fault (the “Unagreed Fault”) which the Contractor
believes is not an Acceptance Incident but which POCL believes is

a category (b) fault (A.I.: 369)

(together the “Outstanding Faults”).

207738/10582 CCNSS0a.doe JRT 200899: 1528
FUJ00000485
FUJ00000485

(D) It is agreed that there is no CSR Acceptance Specification in respect

of which there are more than 10 category (b) faults.

(E) Under paragraph 2.1 of Schedule All to the Codified Agreement
(“Schedule All”), four conditions for CSR Acceptance have to be
satisfied. The parties agree that the CSR Acceptance Tests have been
carried out and that the CSR Core Observation Period and the CSR
Operational Trial Review Period have expired. If the Contractor is
correct that
the Disputed Category A Faults are of medium severity then the
thresholds in paragraph 2.2 of Schedule All of the Codified Agreement
have been met. The remaining
condition for CSR Acceptance is that a timetable has been agreed to

resolve all outstanding category (b) faults.

(F) If, as at the end of the CSR Operational Trial Review Period, any one
of the Disputed Category A faults is a category (a) fault then CSR

Acceptance has not been achieved as

at the end of the CSR Operational Trial Review Period.

(G) If, as at the end of the CSR Operational Trial Review Period, a
timetable has not been agreed between the parties to resolve all
outstanding category (b) faults, then CSR Acceptance has not been
achieved as at the end of the CSR Operational Trial Review Period.

Such a timetable has not been agreed.

It is Agreed as follows:

1. CSR Acceptance

1.1 The parties agree that CSR Acceptance was not achieved as at the end

of the CSR Operational Trial Review Period.

1.2 Under paragraph 3.1 of Schedule All the Contractor is entitled to a
period of three
months from 16th August 1999 in which to remedy the outstanding
defaults at its own expense (subject to paragraph 6.9 of Schedule All
if applicable) and to re-submit the
Core System Release in its entirety for the second CSR Acceptance

Test.

Remedy of Outstanding Faults

With a view to facilitating the obtaining of CSR Acceptance in the
Second CSR

Acceptance Test, the parties agree as follows:

In the period between the date of this Agreement and 175th September
1999 (the

“Limited Trial Period”), the parties will set up and conduct a
programme of joint

workshops for the purpose of agreeing (to the extent not already

agreed) :-
(i) resolution plans for the Agreed Category B Faults, the Disputed
Category A

Faults, the Disputed Category B Faults (if agreed or determined
to be category
(b) faults), and (if appropriate) the Unagreed Fault; and

(ii) a single timetable for resolution of outstanding category (b)
faults (including any Disputed Category A Faults determined to

be, or recategorised as, category (b) faults).

The joint workshop will be chaired by Keith Baines of POCL and Tony
Oppenheim of the Contractor and will be charged with the production
of agreed resolution plans, the agreement of a timetable for their
implementation, and general project management of

the resolution process.

Agreement as to resolution of faults having been hampered by
differences as to the

data, the parties will agree as soon as possible within the Limited
Trial Period an appropriate set of measures (including data gathering

and testing) to determine:

the extent of the disputed faults and

the efficacy of any agreed resolution plans.

207738/10582 CCNSS0a.doe JRT 200899: 1528
FUJ00000485
FUJ00000485

The Contractor shall make available to POCL as soon as possible all
data available to

the Contractor relevant to any of the Outstanding Faults, including,
without limitation, all system recorded data relating to the
incidence of rebooting of counter terminals

(relevant to AI 298).

The parties will involve Peter Copping as Expert in the activities
referred to in this paragraph 2. There may be occasions on which the
Expert is asked to determine an

issue as between the parties in accordance with the provisions of
Schedule All (for example he may be required to determine the status
of the Unagreed Fault) but

otherwise (save as expressly contemplated in this letter) his role
will be as facilitator and adviser to the parties in their efforts to
achieve successful resolution of outstanding

issues.

Second Acceptance Test

The provisions of Schedule All relating to the Second Acceptance Test
shall be varied

as follows:-

Notwithstanding paragraph 3.1 of Schedule All, the only elements of
the Core System Release required to be re-submitted for testing in
the Second CSR Acceptance Test

shall be those relating to the Outstanding Faults.

The following faults may be raised as Acceptance Incidents in
relation to the Second

CSR Acceptance Test:-

3.2.1 any fault arising upon the re-testing referred to in paragraph

3.1 above;

3.2.2 where any corrective work is carried out by Pathway in relation
to any of the Outstanding Faults, any fault which may be caused
by that corrective work or

may come to light only as a result of that corrective work; and

207738/10582 CCNSS0a.doe JRT 200899: 1528

FUJ00000485
FUJ00000485

3.2.3 (subject to paragraph 3.3 below), any other substantive fault
(a “Substantive
New Fault”) which arises in the live environment prior to CSR
Acceptance and which in the reasonable opinion of Keith Baines
or John Meagher is material in

the context of CSR Acceptance.

All such which faults shall be categorised according to paragraphs 7.1(a),
(b) and (c) of
Schedule All.

3.3. The parties agree the following in relation to Substantive New

Faults:-

3.3.1 no fault which was observed and categorised as a fault prior to
the end of the
CSR Operational Trial Review Period shall be raised as a
Substantive New Fault thereafter unless, in the reasonable
opinion of POCL, the nature of the fault
shall have changed or its effect, impact, seriousness or
frequency shall have become greater since the end of the CSR
Operational Trial Period, in each case
so as to have, in the reasonable opinion of POCL, a material

adverse effect on POCL’s business or operations;

3.3.2 no Substantive New Fault which is categorised as a category (b)
fault shall

count towards the threshold in paragraph 2.2(ii) of Schedule

3.3.3 notwithstanding paragraph 2.1(iv) of Schedule All, the failure
to agree a
timetable to resolve a Substantive New Fault which is a
category (b) fault
arising after 3 September 1999 shall not prevent CSR

Acceptance; and

3.3.4 for the avoidance of doubt CSR Acceptance will not occur if

there is a

207738/10582 CCNSS0a.doc JRT 200899:1528
a

FUJ00000485
FUJ00000485

Substantive New Fault which is categorised as a category (a)

fault.

If upon CSR Acceptance there remains any Substantive New Fault which
is a category

(b) fault arising after 31 September, 1999 and in respect of which a
timetable has not

been agreed for its resolution, the parties shall agree such a
timetable by 15th

November, 1999, in default of which either party shall be entitled to
request the Expert to specify such a timetable, which shall then be

binding on both parties.

If by 17% September, 1999 there remains any Substantive New Fault
which is a category (b) fault reported to the Contractor on or prior
to 34 September, 1999 and in respect of which a timetable has not

been agreed for its resolution, POCL shall not withhold its agreement
to the timetable proposed by the Contractor if the Expert shall have

stated in writing, prior to CSR Acceptance, that:-

3.5.1 the Contractor’s proposed rectification plan is in the Expert’s
opinion likely to resolve the Substantive New Fault by the date
specified by the Contractor

therein; and

3.5.2 resolution of the Substantive New Fault by that date would, in
the Expert’s
opinion (having listened to the representations of both
parties), be likely to mean that the Substantive New Fault
would not have a material adverse effect on POCL’s business or

operations.

POCL warrants that none of its employees or contractors directly
involved in the CSR Acceptance process is aware of any fault in
relation to the Core System which has not already been reported to
the Contractor and which that employee or contractor knows would
constitute a Substantive New Fault, categorised as category (a) or

category (b), if and when so reported.

schedules), indemnify POCL on demand against all costs and expenses
