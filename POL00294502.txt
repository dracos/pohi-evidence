PRE-HORIZON ON-LINE CASE

Offence and Case History

1. On the 22™ March 2010 at the Bolton Crown Court before HHJ Knott, this
defendant was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment suspended for 2
years. She also received a supervision requirement for 12 months and an
unpaid work requirement of 200 hours. A compensation order for
£13,188.89 was made with costs of £2,000. The defendant was originally
charged with Theft of £13,188.89 belonging to Post Office Ltd. However,
this was amended by prosecution counsel to 2 counts of Theft and False
Accounting between 30" August 2005 - 4" July 2008. The particulars of
the offences were that on Count 1 she falsified the Final Branch Trading
Accounts for Fishpool Post office, and that on Count 2 she stole an

unspecified amount of cash belonging to Post Office Limited.

2. The defendant was born on the! She was summonsed
for Theft and appeared at Bury Magistrates Court on 19" November 2008.
The magistrates refused jurisdiction and committal took place on 14"

January 2009.

3. She pleaded not guilty to both counts at her Plea and Case Management
Hearing on 30" April 2009 and her trial was originally fixed for 16"
November 2009. On 10 November 2009 the fixture was broken by

Prosecution case

4. The defendant was then 52 years old and had been officer in charge of
Fishpool Post Office for 2 years and 10 months. During the summer of
2008 Helen Rose identified a number of questionable stock adjustment
transactions being conducted at Fishpool, dating back to at least
November 2007. It started with a stock adjustment of £7,500 and similar
transactions continued throughout and steadily increased to £13,000 by
27" June 2008. A routine security visit was then conducted to establish

whether fraudulent activity was being conducted at the branch.

5. On 2" July 2008 Post Office Auditors attended Fishpool in the afternoon
and were met by the defendant and another staff member. The defendant
confirmed she was the officer in charge and that the sub postmaster, Mr
Masood, rarely attended r GRO. I The branch was due to close at
1300 hours that day. Mr Masood did attend upon request and explained
that he left everything to the defendant and had little involvement since
April 2007. The officers informed him of the suspect transactions and the

amount and arranged for an audit the following day.

6. The defendant asked to speak to one of the officers in private. She then
told him that she had been manipulating the cheque figures to hide a
shortage. During the short period the officers had been in the Fishpool
office she had in fact managed to remit out £14,000 of cheques so that the

cash would balance. j GRO

7. The following morning the audit took place and the financial audit
revealed a total shortfall of £13,188.89 which was made up as follows:
- Difference in cash figures +£913.27
- Difference in stock figures - £102.16

- Transaction errors revealed to documentation -£14,000

8. There were also a number of missing Green Giros but these did not form

part of the case against the defendant.

9. A search was then made of the defendant’s home address and it was

apparent that she had financial problems. She had

home.

10. The defendant was interviewed under caution on 3" July 2008. She said

as follows:

- She had full responsibility for running the office which included
weekly and monthly balances.

- There were a number of unexplained losses she had hidden from Mr

I these started at around April 2007 when

- She conducted all the fraudulent entries under her own user i/d.

- She expected the losses to come back as transaction corrections.

- No other worker in the office knew about her actions.

- She denied paying personal bills with the money or taking any money

from the office.

Defence case

11.The defendant pleaded not guilty at her plea and case management
hearing and in due course served a defence case statement. In it she
accepted that she completed irregular transactions but had no certainty
of the exact details or regularity. She did, however, concede that she acted
in a manner which caused loss to Post Office. This seems to be a full

admission to the false accounting charge that she faced. She denied that
POL00294502
POL00294502

any false accounting was for her own gain and could not explain the
losses. She also alleged that Mr and Mrs Masood would regularly remove
cash sums to use in the Pharmacy and National Lottery, that they were
very poor at following accounting practices, which was an on-going
problem. She referred to there being no supervision and adequate staff
training, and said she had been paid with cash rather than obtaining pay
slips. She sought disclosure of the Fishpool Office accounts and various

other items of disclosure relating to Mr Masood.

Discussion

12.The defendant, whilst entering a not guilty plea to false accounting,
admitted the offence to the auditors, in interview and in her defence
statement. She ultimately pleaded guilty on a full facts basis to theft. I
have not seen any basis of plea, and a compensation order was made in

relation to the full amount of the discrepancy of £13,188.89.

13. The defence advanced in the defence statement positively asserts that the
postmaster and his wife were removing POL funds for their own use and
the Post Office was being run in a shambolic fashion and an employee had

left after money had gone missing.

14. It is my view that had we had the material contained in the Second Sight
Interim Report that we would, certainly on receipt of the defence
statement, have disclosed it to the defence. Whilst the Second Sight
Interim Report deals, in the main with Horizon on Line it does deal in

passing with the system operated by this defendant.

15.In my view the defendant’s guilty plea and her putting forward of a
positive assertion that the Postmaster had stolen at least some of the
money as had other employees and that the money might have been lost
through shambolic accounting practices make the successful founding of

an appeal against conviction in relation to the count of theft unlikely. Her
POL00294502
POL00294502

admissions at every stage to false accounting would render a successful
appeal virtually impossible. The sentence passed would be a generous one
for the false accounting alone and any appeal against sentence again

would be unlikely

Conclusion

16.In my view, whilst we would probably have disclosed the matters
contained in the Second Sight Interim Report to the defence had we had
them at the time, the positive defence advanced by the defendant that
losses were (rather than might have been) generated by the
dishonesty/incompetence of others and her own plea to theft on a full
facts basis, renders any arguable grounds of appeal beyond any realistic

chance of success. No further disclosure in this case is warranted.
