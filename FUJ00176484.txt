It cannot connect to this workstation to find the new value of the MaxReanimation parameter.

II expect ISD wish this to go to Audit Dev for information rather than for any action as this is an exceptional case.

A problem remains with the installation of the RQuery application. When trying to status/gap check the messagestore the
application would bomb out saying that the object in CheckStatus (gap check) "Failed to create RiposteBroker object in
checkstatus - typically and install error”

Isoth the RIPOS'TEBROKER.DLL & RIPOSTEBROKER.TLB were missing from the C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32. I then added them to try to get the
status check to run on RQUERY to test our MessageStore but I could not register the DLL although I was able to register the TLB.

[There seemed to be a problem in the registering of the "RIPOSTEBROKER.DLL" with regsvr.dll, with my login it kept failing. Please
investigate.

It presume she means she cannot register using regsvr32.exe.
Ir cannot believe it is a permissions problem as she could register the type library.

'EBROKER. DLL.

I still do not have access to this box, therefore could ISD please try to register the C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\RIPOS'
