1 Introduction

1.1 Process Owner
The owner of this process is the RMG BU Lead SDM, Service Operations.

1.2 Process Objective

The key objective of the process is to ensure effective and efficient management of Major Incidents,
through:

e Improvements of communication channels.

e Clarify the need to communicate awareness of potential incidents

e Improved accuracy of reporting against status of incident

e Allowing technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident
e Avoid unnecessary alerting of the customer

e Demonstrate to the Post Office a more professional approach

e Provision of clear defined roles and responsibilities

e Defined reporting/update timelines through duration of a major incident.

e Improved governance

e Assessing which incidents are major and which are ‘Business as Usual’

1.3. Process Rationale

This document outlines the communication and management process and guidelines to be followed in
relation to Major Incidents impacting the live estate.

The methodology defined within this document augments the existing SMS framework process presently
deployed within the live estate.

The aim of the document is to provide a pre-defined process on which future major incident
communication and management will follow and that any parties involved in that process provide
updates /receive updates at defined intervals from inception to closure of any major service impacts.

Mandatory Guidelines

Whilst it is important to maintain a balance between:

a) Allowing the technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident

b) Avoid unnecessary alerting of the customer

c) Assessing which incidents are major

The following guidelines should be adhered to.

During HSD IMT Core Hours (Monday — Friday 08:00 — 18:00 and Saturday 08:00 - 14:00) HSD.
IMT should be the first point of contact for operational contact between Fujitsu and the end user.
Outside these hours SMC acts as the first point of contact.

Any activity detailed in this document which is assigned to the HSD IMT is handed over to SMC
outside the HSD IMT Core Hours.

The relevant technical teams who are monitoring and aware of a potential major incident must
page/call the appropriate Major Incident Manager (Duty Manager out of hours) as soon as
possible, rather than wait This is not limited to major incidents alone, but must be delivered
wherever a state other than Business as Usual has been detected. The Major Incident Manager
must in turn communicate the potential incident, to POL SD for awareness and monitoring in
POL. This is usually done via the HSD IMT in hours.

The Major Incident Manager (or Duty Manager out of hours) is responsible for communicating
both up the Fujitsu Organisation and across (see appendix 10.3) to their counterpart in POL.
Where this is impractical (i.e. leave, out of hours, unavailable), the initiative should be taken to
jump up the organisation. The important fact is that the customer is informed in a timely manner
and at the correct touch point. This communication should be by voice or direct SMS. The
communication should include the date, time, name, nature of problem, severity, if service
affecting, likely impact, and the owner for contact.

The Major Incident Manager (Duty Manager OOH) should also initiate communication using
SMS via HSD IMT, 08.00 to 18.00 Monday to Friday, and Saturday 08.00 to 14.00. Outside of
these hours, SMS should be via SMC.

3 Definition of a Major Incident

3.1 Incident Classification

As a general rule a Major Incident will always be an incident rated as severity level A (critical) in the
RMG BU Customer Service Incident Management Process Details document (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018)
version 2.0, or a series of connected lower severity rated Incidents which combine to have a significant
business impact. However not all incidents rated at severity level A qualify. This is because the severity
levels do not necessarily translate to the global business impact on POL’s business. For example a
single counter post office which is unable to transact, regardless of its business volumes is rated as a
Severity A.

For simplicity, Incidents are classified into three impact levels: High, Medium and Low.

High — An Incident that has occurred with a significant and potentially prolonged adverse impact on POL
business. Typically these Incidents will initially require a significant amount of reactive management
before they can be controlled and resolved.

Medium — An Incident that has the potential to cause significant impact to POL business but can be
controlled and mitigated against through effective management.

Low — An Incident that requires business attention but if managed effectively will not have significant
impact on POL business.

3.2 Influencing Factors in calling Major Incident

It is important that a major incident is defined as such, because of its business impact on the day when it
occurs, rather than simply being defined as a major incident because it appears on a list. The following
parameters will also feed into the consideration of whether a major incident exists, as follows:

e Duration i.e. how long has the vulnerability to service already existed

e Impact across the estate, including consideration of whether a service is merely degraded or
actually stopped

e Time at which the event occurs in relation to the 24 hour business day
e Time of year - eg Christmas / Easter / End of month/quarter DVLA

e Anticipated time before service can be resumed

e Impact to POL Branches, customers, clients or brand image

e Business initiatives e.g. product launches

3.3 Major Incident Triggers

The criteria below could trigger a major incident, however as detailed in 3.2, the influencing factors must
be considered. As such the list below can never be exhaustive, whilst if an incident occurs which is not
detailed, this should not be precluded from being a major incident.

4 Calling the Major Incident

During business hours the Major Incident Manager declares and manages Major Incident (with
handovers to the Duty Manager where applicable.)

Where the impact of the incident is not immediately obvious, and it is not clear if Major Incident should
be called, escalation and discussion with the RMG BU Lead SDM, Service Operations, RMG BU Head of
Service Operations or RMG BU Service Director should occur, and a collective decision made. If Major
Incident is not called, the incident should be monitored until closure, to ensure that the impact does not
increase to Major Incident.

In the event that multiple Services are impacted, multiple Major Incident Managers will be appointed by
RMG BU Lead SDM, Service Operations, RMG BU Head of Service Operations or RMG BU Service
Director, who will remain in this role until incident closure.

Out of hours the Duty Manager is responsible for declaring Major Incident.

The Tech Bridge follows a set agenda which covers:

Roll call, Summary of Incident, Incident Overview,
Current Impact, Current Investigation / Recovery Action,
Remedial Actions, Actions to carry forward to Major
Incident Review

The agenda template is stored on

7 nder Service Support > Major Incident -
Management Templates

Following the Tech Bridge, a further SMS will be sent,
providing an update on the Incident

If the outcome of the Tech Bridge is that the Incident is
determined Business As Usual (low) then an SMS
communication will be sent stating that the Incident is not a
Major Incident.

From this point forward, SMS communication, timing and
delivery requests, becomes the responsibility of the Major
Incident Manager. 30-minute updates should be the norm

The Major Incident Manager will also distribute minutes
following the conference call.

TRM will provide summary minutes to the MIM who will
distribute the minutes.

At the time agreed at the first Tech Bridge, the subsequent
Tech Bridges are held. The same agenda is followed, and
progress on actions / recovery is provided.

If no clear recovery path is identified, the decision is then
taken on whether to escalate for Service Bridge direction

7 Formal Incident Closure & Major Incident Review

The purpose of a Major Incident Review is:

1. To understand the Incident that prevented a Service or Services from being delivered.
2. To confirm impact to the business, during and after the Incident and agree number of branches
impacted and duration of Major Incident.
3. To confirm the end-to-end recovery process & timeline and identify that all documented
processes were followed.
4. To analyse the management of the Incident & the effectiveness of the governance process.
5. To identify corrective actions to:
i. prevent recurrence of Incident
ii. minimise future business impact
iii, improve management of Incidents
6. To formally close the Major Incident

Output: To confirm details provided in the draft MIR provided to POL, update with corrective actions and
redistribute. The agreed impact of Major Incident must be sent to Branch Network Service Delivery
Manager for inclusion in the Counter Availability SLT Figures.

If this review highlights areas where improvements can be made, an agreed Service Improvement Plan
will be produced with appropriate actions, owners and timescales. Service Management will track all
actions to resolution. Third party actions will be reviewed at Service Review meetings.

__IRRELEVANT. under Service Support

Templ

It is critical that the number of branches impacted and the duration of the Major Incident is agreed at the
Major Incident Review and this agreement must come from POL. If for some reason POL is not present
at the Major Incident Review meeting, a separate conversation must take place. This information is
required because Major Incidents affect Counter Availability and Liquidated Damages (LDs) are paid on
Counter Availability as detailed in 7.1 below.

7.1 Calculating Liquidated Damages payable on Major
Incidents.

Liquidated damages are payable on Major Incidents which qualify as Failure Events as detailed in the
Branch Network Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD0011). Failure Event is defined in this document as
an event or series of connected events which causes one or more Counter Positions to be deemed to be
Unavailable due to a Network Wide Failure or a Local Failure. Ongoing failures will be deemed to be part
of such Failure Event until the Failure Event is closed in accordance with the Incident closure and Major
Incident Review process as detailed in section 7.0.

For a Failure Event the Incident Closure & Major Incident Review Process will require Post Office and
Fujitsu Services to agree the number of Branches and Counter Positions affected and the duration of the
outage;

The duration of the Incident must be agreed with Post Office & rounded to the nearest 30 minutes as
detailed in the Network Wide Rounding Table below
