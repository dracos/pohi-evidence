Tony

Please find attached the letter of 1 September 2017 — the relevant paragraph is 1.5.

Andy may say differently, but I don't think in this letter we used the word "document" in the CPR sense but, instead, to
explain that the KEL is not a fixed log or a printed handbook but a live electronic database.

In terms of control, Andy — are any issues raised by the fact that ATOS (who I believe act as POL's agent) have
access to the database?

Kind regards

Amy

Thanks for sending the 13 October 2016 letter, Amy.

I'ma little concerned that we may be playing into their hands by provoking a CPR 31.14 application for
inspection of the KEL. Unless we play our cards right, this could give them the chance to portray us as
unnecessarily (and therefore suspiciously) defensive, obstructive and possibly even evasive about the KEL.

Could you also send over our letter dated I September 2017 — if their summary of it is fair (which I doubt) I
would like to understand why we seem to have claimed that the KEL is not a document, when it plainly is,
and why we don't seem to have mentioned that it is not in our control, which seems to me to be a critical
point.

On the question of control, we need to be absolutely clear that we have no right to inspect or take copies of
the KEL, either under the Fujitsu contract or under the law of agency (is Fujitsu holding it as our agent?),
and that there is no practice under which we are habitually or usually allowed to inspect documents of this
sort if we want to see them.

Best wishes,

Tony
