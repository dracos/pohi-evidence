Dear Mr Jones,

I refer to our telephone conversations of 4th and 5th February 2010 with
regards to obtaining a witness statement of the Defence challenging the
reliability of Horizon. I understand that Mr Jenkins has been identified
as an experienced person to give this statement. I would be grateful,
after your meeting this morning, if you could confirm to me when Mr
Jenkins would be back to return to duty
apply to Guildford Crown Court to get an extension to serve his evidence.
As you are aware there is a Court Order for this evidence to be served by
Monday 8th February 2010 at 4pm.

Thank you for your kind assistance and look forward to hearing from you.
