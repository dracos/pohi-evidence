Hi All,

Please find the requests attached - FO1201612201017 is still live and due on 20 January, the current drafted response is
attached.

We are waiting for feedback from IT, can you let me know who will be handling the management of the response? I have
attached the position so far with the remainder of the search regarding the unanswered question in the draft.

Regards,

Thanks Andy — that is fine by me.

Kerry ~ can you pull together all the live and historic FO! requests (together with our responses} that relate to what is
being referred to as the “Known Errors Log”. As per the below, they appear to be being driven by the Group Litigation.

Andy & Paul ~ If you could still provide us with the answers provided to date by Pete N, that would be useful. Further,
do you want us to progress the live FO! requests that relate to the KEL, or will this now be passed to BD?

Many thanks

Paul's email is connected with a question from the CCRC. Freeths have also asked for the KEL but we have refused to
disclose it so far.

I think we need to pull all these enquiries under one roof otherwise we might be asking the same questions of FJ. Also,
given the need to preserve privilege, I think this should be led by the lawyers.

Can I propose that Paul takes the lead, coordinates input from POL IT and FJ, gathers all the necessary info into one
place and then disseminates the answers as needed?

Mark / Rodric — do you agree?

Hi Paul & Rod,

POL-0021837
POL00025358
POL00025358

is this as a result of an FOI request or to do with the Group Litigation? If the latter, we have also had a FOI request come
in, that I have been trying to, get to the bottom of (see attached).

As such, could I see the info provided to date on this by Pete Newsome?
Many thanks

Mark

As discussed, here is a draft email to go to Fujitsu setting out the CCRC’s queries on the KEL.

I don’t know when is the appropriate time to send it given the ongoing discussions with FJ of ways of working — please
can you let me know when it has gone to FJ or, alternatively, if and when you want me to send it.

My previous correspondence with FJ on this point has been with Pete Newsome.
Many thanks

Paul

Dear Pete

Following on from the helpful information you provided previously on the KEL, the CCRC have asked some follow-up
questions which I have set out below.

e How far back does the available KEL go?

e How easy is it to search? For example, is it searchable by branch, by area or by date
parameters?

e sit searchable by issue? We have already explained to the CCRC that most of the entries are
not connected to branch accounting. Is it possible to say how many entries are related to
branch accounting?

« What is the retention policy that’s applied to the KEL?

Would you be able to provide answers to these questions please? Thanks again for all your help on this.

Kind regards
