A short e mail to check we are "at one" on forward facing actions. As I see it the running order is as follows:

- We get Neuberger QC recusal comment/advice this eve"

-  If'a runner’ we need to decide between Grabiner QC & Mark Howard QC. That decision could be made
tomorrow or early next week. From e mails I sense that you are leaning towards MHQC

- We then instruct the QC who would "do" the recusal advocacy (assuming they too concur with the

Neuberger view of the world)

- Alongside the above work stream we will also get input from Neuberger QC over Common Issues appeal

at some point next week (I hope. That is the timeframe I'll push for)

- We then take decisions next week (post Neuberger QC advice) over steps in Common Issues appeal (as

to who/when etc).

No reply needed to this unless you have a different view.
