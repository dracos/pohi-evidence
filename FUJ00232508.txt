Without Prejudice

Dear Mike
{ Re BIMS Incidents
I am writing in response to your letters of 16 July 2002 and 30 August 2002.

Thank you for your agreement to Case Law Nos. 2, 3, 7 and 8 and I will arrange for a
credit note for £9,558.63 to be raised being the sum of £5,156.60 in respect Case
Law 7 and £4,402.03 in respect of Case Law 8.

St

With regard to Case Law Nos. 4&5 (related), I have previously set out Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Limited’s view of the circumstances. I just do not understand how
the TIP interface process would have prevented these instances from occurring as
you suggest. At this time, Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Limited is still prepared to offer
a payment of £9,075.00 in respect of these two Case Law items.

As for Case Law 6, as there is no effect on the Cash Account, there can be no cash
account error. This matter relates to harvesting and despite Fujitsu Services
(Pathway) Limited resubmitting the transactions electronically following an agreed
process, TIP was not in a position to accept the re-transmitted files. Fujitsu Services
(Pathway) Limited does not accept any liability for this Case.

I trust that you will be able to accept the position set out above in order that these
incidents may now be closed.

Yours sincerely

COLIN LENTON-SMITH
Commercial and Finance Director, Pathway
