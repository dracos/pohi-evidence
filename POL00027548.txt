Horizon claims

POL/HF/RW

Simon Baker

POL has received various claims from
subpostmasters (SPMs) alleging wrongful
termination of contract and/or damages based
on alleged defects in the Horizon system and
POL's internal processes.

These allegations were initially made in 5
claims brought through the SPMs'’ solicitors,
Shoosmiths. I Shoosmiths is not currently
progressing these claims through the courts.

Similar allegations are also being made through
SPMs’ MPs, through the “Justice for
Subpostmasters Alliance” (JFSA), and in
defences to court proceedings brought by POL
to recover debts from SPMs.

‘An independent investigator Second Sight
Support Services Ltd (Second Sight) has been
reviewing these allegations in consultation with
James Arbuthnot MP and JFSA.

On 08.07.13, Second Sight provided an
interim report on its review. This is the
subject of a stand-alone report to the Board.

Second Sights initial findings (based on its
review of 4 of the 47 cases being considered)
conclude that while there are no systemic
problems with Horizon, there are two specific
“bugs”, which gave rise to errors in a number
of branches’ accounts. Second Sight also
highlighted shortcomings in POL’s internal
training and support to SPMs in relation to
the Horizon system

Second Sight is continuing to investigate the
SPMs’ concerns. POL is cooperating with
Second Sight’s investigation and conducting
a review of the criminal and civil proceedings
it has issued against SPMs where issues with
the Horizon system have been raised to
establish which cases may be vulnerable to
challenge.

POL is asking the Court to dismiss the claim
on the grounds that it is a commercial matter
which the Court cannot review, and in any
event POL did not breach the SPM’s rights.
