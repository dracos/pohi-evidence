The decision to prosecute will be reached by applying the general principles and
guidance offered by ‘The Code for Crown Prosecutors’, in particular ‘The Full Code
Test’.

‘The Full Code Test’ will be applied and adhered to before commencing a criminal
prosecution. The ‘Test’ has two stages. If the evidence passes the evidential stage,
the Prosecutor must proceed to the second stage and decide if a prosecution is
needed in the public interest. A prosecution will be required if it is in the public
interest to do so.

Where a criminal investigation identifies an ernployee’s behaviour that falls short of
requiring a criminal prosecution the employee will normally be subject to the relevant
HR processes,
