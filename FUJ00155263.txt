Subject: Riposte Timeout waiting for lock events

Penny,

We discussed this event when it occurred while CABSProcess was running (at 7pm) but we didn't explain why
it might be seen at other times - and if you were ever questioned about it, it might confuse you.

Basically it happens when one process has locked the messagestore (usually only very briefly) and:another
process tries to access the messagestore at precisely the same time.

The worst offender for doing the locking is CABSProcess, but it can happen at other times too.

Whether it causes a problem or not depends on a) what the second process is trying to do and b) whether
that process handles the.error situation in a sensible way.

All the checks we have made have shown that, in the. vast majority of cases, what is being done has no
financial impact and doesn't affect the integrity of the system in any way, and/or the error situation is handled
sensibly.

So when I check these ARQs you are sending over,
e first! try to identify the two processes involved
« then I assess whether the second process could conceivably have failed to handle the situation, and

if so would it have any financial or operational impact

Hope this isn't too much information.
