vFINAL.docx

OFFICIAL - SENSITIVE
Hi Nicol,

There will be a call between Lisa Harrington, POL’s RemCo Chair, and the Permanent Secretary this
Thursday where the following POL pay issues will be addressed:
1. STIP 21-22 MPM breach - steps taken to address this
2. Retrospective approval of a change in the structure of the 2021/22 STIP.
3. Approval of changes in metrics for the 2021-24 LTIP
4. Future pay proposals (STIP 2022-23 and LTIP 2022-25) where metrics are not yet finalised
and proposals are not ready.

UKGI has set up the call between the RemCo Chair and the Permanent Secretary to manage POL’s
expectations on their pay proposals and set up the framework for next steps.

I have attached the briefing note ahead of the Pre-Brief Meeting this week between UKGI and Perm
Sec.

Next steps
Lisa meeting Perm Sec 27 October 2pm (Tom Cooper & David Bickerton to attend from
UKGI/BEIS)
 Pre-brief meeting between UKGI and Perm Sec 26" October 4.30pm (Roshana Arasaratnam
and Tom Cooper to attend from UKGI)

Thanks again for your help. Please let me know if any questions.

Best,

Siv

Hi James,
Thanks for sending through.

Perm sec has reviewed the sub. In its current form she thinks ministers are likely to reject the
retrospective approval so it need some further work. She also wasn’t clear on the reasons behind
delegation to UKGI - to note she doesn’t necessarily disagree here. Grateful if you can revise with this
in mind drawing on BEIS pol team as needed.

Hi Nicol

Please find attached submission for the Permanent Secretary on the request from POL’s RemCo Chair
to approve the bonus schemes.

Given the sensitivities, we are initially sending this for Perm Sec’s approval and, pending her views,
we will send to Minister Russell for approval. This is not super urgent, but given the potential for this
to be un-straightforward, we ask for views by mid or later next week please.

All the best

Hi James,

Thanks for the draft, Sarah fed back with some minor tweaks — removing the line on nick read (given
his potential flight risk) and some additional, softer wording. As they're handwritten notes I will
update the version sent through and send back to Lisa.

Best,

Morning Nicol

Please find attached draft letter for Sarah to send to Lisa for now. Obviously very happy to adjust if
you've any thoughts on this.

We’re working through a draft submission and triangulating views on the recommendation before
finalising. It is not super urgent to get this approved (though it will need to be sorted by early-mid
November) and we will get a sub to you next week.

All the best

We are putting a submission together on the case for retrospective approval which we will give to

We’re happy to draft Perm Sec’s response to Lisa’s apology if that’s helpful Nicol?

I asked them to separate the governance issue from the case for the payment into 2 letters so we can
deal with them separately. It also avoids the awful look of a single letter saying “We (POL) got the
governance wrong but the outcome is correct”.
So I suggest option C — we acknowledge both letters separately.
* In response to the Governance apology I suggest we write back saying that we note it and
look forward to hearing what they have done to improve the approval process.
* In response to the retrospective approval request (which makes the case that Sarah was
asking for), we ignore the governance point (as that is dealt with in the other chain) and assess
the case that they have made.

Kind regards

Hi all,

POL have sent through two letters following the Remco/Bonus debacle. Perm sec was clear that we
should request a proper case very rapidly with a hard deadline and that whilst we don't need to
require repayment at this time we do need to flag that repayment would be required if the case is not
approved.

Grateful for quick view tomorrow on whether we:

a. send a combined response to both letters and follow up with mtg to discuss
b. acknowledge letters and discuss the issues in mtg with Lisa and/or Ben

My assumption is (a) is most sensible (?). If individuals on chain agree can UKGI lead on drafting a
response, with input from POL policy team, so we are in position to send Friday pm. Also if there is an
option (c) im missing then do shout!

Thanks,
Nicol
