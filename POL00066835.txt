Simon,

During the conf with BAQC he

asked that a further line be put in the letters providing disclosure post conviction to say
that...the prosecution recognises its obligation post conviction to disclose any information
which may affect the safety of a conviction”

Said that he was worried about Hutchings.

I have just put on 37142 draft letters for Della Robinson and Lynette Hutchings - in the
usual form but with the extra line in. However I note that in the Full Review of Della
Robinson you said at para 25, “I will draft a letter to the defence for Post Office Ltd’s
approval...”

Given that we have received an e-mail today (also on 37142) containing questions raised by
BAQC - I am tempted to explain that the disclosure letters previously sent have all been in
the same format and that the format has been amended given the advice of BAQC in conf. I
am also minded to send the draft letters for his approval, but thought I would ask whether
you wish to further amend the letters first.

Martin.
