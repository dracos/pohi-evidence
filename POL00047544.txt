Post Office® branch auditing — Period 6 report (2004/05)

1 Introduction

This report provides a summary of the issues revealed at the audits undertaken by
Audit & Inspections at Post Office® branches by the end of the sixth period of
2004/05. The report will be used as an input to Rod Ismay’s report to the Post Office
Ltd Board or Executive Committee (as appropriate) and the newly formed Risk &
Compliance Committee.

Further to the comments in the last report, and following further feedback, it has
been decided that this report will be produced quarterly, with interim reports
(covering significant changes to findings outlined in previous reports or reporting on
emerging issues) supplied in single screen e-mail. The appendix to this report has
also been streamlined and, while it will only be circulated with each quarterly report,
an updated version will remain available each month, on request. Details of the level
of audit activity, by audit type and against plans, will be reported annually, but is also
available on request, monthly.

2. Executive summary

The total of all cash account losses revealed at audit in the first six months of the
year has amounted to £2.8m (from approx. 1000 audits). While the shortages
revealed at the majority of these audits would be made good by the subpostmaster
or might be rectified by error notices, £1.9m of the total amount is based on the
POL00047544

findings of just 20 branches audited. Although in some of these cases, there were
indications of errors being made, which would be rectified by an error notice, there is
also a significant risk that the losses identified in most of these cases will not be
recovered. It is also a concern that, in spite of the size of amounts of discrepancies,
a precautionary suspension was not made in 35% of these cases.

Following the audit of Blackwood, which confirmed a loss of £436k, a post incident
review took place, led by Rod Ismay. The output of this review was to put forward a
number of recommendations. This included a review of exception reporting, to aid
the earlier identification of significant financial concerns, and more through follow up
processes to reported issues (including the type of financial concerns that are visible
and do not require an audit to initiate action), covering escalation and reporting
processes.

A programme of cash check audits at direct managed branches, with the aim of
auditing 5% of these branches by the end of November, has not revealed any
financial irregularities to date but has continued to expose failures by branch
managers to deploy supervisory controls of stocks. This provides a clear opportunity
for misuse of funds to occur. There is also continued concern that there are branch
managers who are falsely declaring full compliance to controls (as part of the self
assessment process within the Annual Certificate of Compliance).

While the level of conformance against a range of controls tested at audit rose to
93%, the conformance to anti-money laundering controls dropped in period six (to
76%, compared with 80% in periods four and five).

Some actions from previous reports remain outstanding, with recommendations
detailed in section 6.

3. Summary of findings at audits of Post Office® branches - Financial
The findings in period six are consistent with those described in previous periods,
with £717k revealed at 150 audits in the period. Blackwood branch accounted for
61% of this total with the result of the audit and the circumstances of the loss
reaching a level of £436k prompting a post incident review and subsequent
recommendations, led by Rod Ismay, Head of Risk Control (his report dated 8
October refers).

The following table details the 20 audits, undertaken in 2004/05, that have revealed
losses in excess of £25k.

4 Summary of findings at audits of Post Office® branches —- Conformance

The overall conformance score across all controls tested was 93.9%. This compares
to 92.5% in period 5 and 91.6% for last year.

The levels of conformance against the areas tested as core at all audits were
generally consistent with that report in previous months except for compliance to
anti-money laundering controls. This dropped in period six to 75.6%, compared with
80.8% in period four and 80.2% in period five, although this is an improvement
against the results last year (of 62.9%).

5 Annual Certificate of Compliance — Directly managed branches

Up to the end of period six, 263 branches had been involved in this self-assessment
process (which means that 422 branches have been involved since it was introduced
in January 2004). However, around 10% of those branches involved have failed to
submit a completed self-assessment form (these branches are detailed in the
appendix to this report).

15% of branch managers, who returned a self-assessment, have declared full
conformance to all the controls within the assessment exercise. However, during the
recent programme of financial audits at directly managed branches, sample checks
of the self-assessment were carried out and revealed that some declarations were
either incorrectly or falsely declared.

Considering both the responses in the self-assessment exercise and the examination
made in follow up visits, there is a significant concern at the levels of non-compliance
to the policy on supervisory control of stocks. The programme of surprise checks of
counter stocks, by branch managers, is a key financial control at directly managed
branches and failure to deploy this control not only creates an environment where
POL00047544
POL00047544

Page 5of7

there is an opportunity to steal cash but increases the risk of internal theft going
undetected until a significant amount has accumulated.

A review of the Annual Certificate of Compliance form is currently being finalised,
with a view to highlight the key controls and for this to be re-communicated to branch
managers when the rolling programme of the Annual Certificate of Compliance is re-
launched in January 2005.
