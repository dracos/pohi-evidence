Subject: REGINA v SEEMA MISRA - GUILDFORD CROWN COURT - TRIAL - ATTACK ON HORIZON
Dear All,

After a lengthy trial at Guildford Crown Court the above named was found Guilty of theft. This case
turned from a relatively straightforward general deficiency case to an unprecedented attack on the
Horizon system. We were beset with unparallel degree of disclosure requests by the Defence. Through
hard work of everyone, Counsel Warwick Tatford, Investigation Officer Jon Longman and through the
considerable expertise of Gareth Jenkins of Fujitsu we were able to destroy to the criminal standard of
proof (beyond all reasonable doubt) every single suggestion made by the Defence.

It is to be hoped the case will set a marker to dissuade other Defendants from jumping on the Horizon
bashing bandwagon.

Dear All

I have been made aware of the fact that many of us are on annual leave next week because of half term. In the
circumstances it seems likely that we will have to reschedule again. Please accept my apologies for this. I will
get my secretary to reschedule.

Regards
Mandy Talbot
