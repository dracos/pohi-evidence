Angela — as you were an RMN in the late 90s, could you confirm that Paul's statement accurately reflects your
understanding?

Rod — Paul is on holiday next week so we would like this signed on Friday if possible.

Thanks

A revised version attached, which accepts all your changes and adds a few more changes from us. Would you mind
reviewing this again? I think we're nearly there.

Also... do you have a copy of any Subrem or ACC from the 1990s about the appointment process for
Subpostmasters. We've got a number of these from 2000 onwards but nothing frorn the 1990s.

Thanks
Andy

Paul

Thanks for your time earlier. Please find attached your draft statement for your comments. I've also attached a few
documents referred to in the statement for you to consider.

POL-0038403
POL00041921
POL00041921

I'd also be grateful for your thoughts on the Subrem attached. In particular...

Para 11 that reads... When the letter accepting appointment is returned, Sub Office Services should notify the outgoing
SubPostmaster in writing of the date of

transfer, with a reminder to have the SubPostmaster contract document (Red book) ready for passing on to the incoming
Subpostmaster. You should also notify all other interested parties (e.g. Payroll, National Savings Bank, Girobank etc.)
confirming date of transfer.

What is the Red Book? ~ The first version of the Subpostmaster Contract document was a loose leaf document issued to
branches in a red ring binder — hence the reference to the “Red Book” ~ which is the Subpostmaster Contract. As I
explained when we spoke, the contract was, at first passed from postmaster to postmaster, so this line in the subrem is a
sensible requirement that the outgoing subpostmaster is reminded of the need to have this ready to pass on to his/her
successor.

Para 14 that reads.... At the transfer it is most important that signed copies are obtained of the form P.13 (Official Secrets
Act), and acknowledgement of appointment. P250 and P272 should be completed for any new assistant which may be
employed also for completeness of identification of Sub office assistants we would suggest a new P356 be raised. The
officer responsible for the transfer should be careful to clearly show which operational equipment and Rules Book are on
hand. Completed forms P301 are required from outgoing Subpostmasters and assistants.

What is the Rules Book? in the days before on-line systems like Horizon the Rules Book (actually a set of ring binders)
contained ail the detailed operational instructions that might be needed in a branch. So although the on-site and off-site
training would teach an incoming postmaster how to conduct transactions, deai with collecting postmen etc, the rules
wouid be ieft on site so that there was set of reference material that could be consulted should the need arise (e.g.a rare
or uncommon transaction).
