The spmr is actually out of contract now as she had submitted her resignation before she was suspended.
She is alleging that the loss has been caused by the Horizon system and I am currently awaiting a decision
from Jason Collins as to whether this is going to be investigated.

Just received the HORIZON data and will send it out to her next week.
To be honest there is no evidence of any criminal activity although the losses are suspicious.

We need to see if she comes back on any problems with the data but I will be looking at
closing the case from a criminal point of view.

Subject: Mrs Stubbs....Barkham Post Office

I met with Mrs Stubbs yesterday and discussed the outstanding debt with her. (This
was not a suspect interview under caution).

The £7000 rem shortage on 25" May 2010. she was aware of as this was due to
the rem being opened and checked by the auditor on the day. Due to a rushed
despatch £7000 was left out of the rem was it was resealed. She says that this was
sorted out by the auditor on the day and she wasn’t aware that she still owed the
£8000. I will need to trace the auditor (Rajinder Gihr), and discuss how this amount
was disposed of or accounted for.

She is more annoyed at the fact that she thinks she did not get the support from
HORIZON regarding checking her figures against the system.

The main point is for the December trading statement when she only opened for
about 2 weeks and still ost £9000.

POL00106847
POL00106847

I have agreed to obtain the full data from HORIZON and look at the transactions for
that period. I think this may help to convince her that HORIZON is ok and it may be
that someone has taken the money.

{t doesn’t help that someone in her village used to help in designing HORIZON and
has suggested that HORIZON is not perfect.

She knows she owes for the office removal (£3400 I think) and says she will repay
when the office is sold.

Will update you later unless you wish to discuss .

After an initial look at the paperwork and then a few questions to Fujitsu, at the moment there
is no reason to doubt the integrity of the system @

I consider that the way to progress this case is for me to arrange to meet with Mrs Stubbs and
find out why she thinks the system is at fault and what evidence she has to support these
allegations.

This will not be a tape recorded interview under caution (al this time) but just a fact finding
interview / statement.

I cannot see this happening until after Christmas due to court commitments but I will contact.
her and let her know I am dealing with the case and will need to meet with her.

Do you know if her address ts still the Post Office® one?

All,

{n review of the information by Mike Wilcox he came across some transactional information
on the Fujitsu data requested, that needs clarification direct from Fujitsu. I have forwarded a
tequest on Mike behalf to Fujitsu asking them to check and clarify the data provided, and it is
expected that we should get a response early next week The anomaly identified in the data
relates to transactions appearing out of normal sequencing and our initial view is that this is
just a potential data filtering issue and nothing untoward, but we do need it to be clarified
before we can decide what steps we might wish to consider. This clearly is a limiting factor in
regards to timeliness to progress from our side, but please be assured we are doing what we
can to try to get the answers as quick as possible.

Ihave referred some quenes to Fujitsu regarding the evidence in this “case , so cannot give
a definitive answer until I receive a reply.

A couple of points which may help in the meantime, is thal I have confirmed that all the rems
have been received so there doesn't seem to be a problem there

When she says that the auditor did a cash check at 09:00 and 13.00 on the 10" May there is
no HORIZON record of this so cannot say either way however she had been serving
customers before 09 00 and the last customer at 09 00 was a withdrawal of £190 71 (£1901s
the shortage she ts disputing)

Sorry I can I be any more specific at the moment

Nigel, this unfortunately is not so straight forward.

I understand Jason asked you a number of questions in an email 21 June and stated that with
the information to hand at thal time that they could not engage from an investigation
perspective As a result of that email, I suspect this.is why the ARQ was requested by the live
service desk and the information was provided to enable further checks.

In light that the information still doesn’t answer the questions posed, I have asked Jason and

what the ex-spmr is holding I think this is going to be a very onerous task but I can't see
how we can let this one go considenng she is questioning the integrity of Horizon

How do you want me to deat with this one? Jason did offer some advice, but I think it has

Andy / fain :
This is quickly turning into a bit of a problem.

This is a potential fraud where losses occurred when a spmr moved into a portacabin, but
ceased the moment she was suspended and somebody else run the office. She did have a
clerk, so it could transpire she has nothing to do with the losses. We are talking about £28k,
a potential flag case, with MP's involved. The spmris questioning the integrity of Horizon.

It looks like contracts/Chesterfield dealt with this themselves, although did speak to

investigations Once I received the paper work from Nigel, it looks like there are numerous
activities that have taken place, including somebody sending in an auditor who sat with the
spmr for half a day which clearly made matters worse. j

I don't know why we were never approached to deal with this as a criminal investigation in the
first instance, perhaps it was felt that it wasn’t at the tme. The auditor supposedly witness all @
transactions for half day and witness Horizon being short, thereby corroborating her account

and also now a potential witness for her (when in fact clearly he can not have witnessed

everything). and also begs the question as to why it was left ‘high and dry’ at the time and

Credence was not checked etc.

This now leaves us in a very difficult situation With the spmr writing letters to Dave Smith,
her MP and no doubt countless other people, this is high profile. She has also joined the
spmr's fight to question the integrity of Horizon, As it stands no investigation has taken place
by us, various intervention has probably complicated this, yet because itis a question of
Horizon integrity we can't simply ignore it, or drop it, but probably have some difficult
questions ahead of us in terms of why has it taken so long for us to consider this criminal if
this is the course of action we take

What we re trying to determine here ts whether there ts any discrepancy between the
information sent in to the Live Service team by the spmr, Mrs Stubbs, and what the Horizon
system 1s showing She is alleging that her losses of £28k+ are due to problems with the
Honzon system after it was relocated into a portacabin last October whilst the branch was
being renovated

Can you advise whether a case 1s being ra.sed on this? Given the fact that we have not
experienced similar losses with the temporary spmr who was appointed after Mrs Stubbs was

suspended and the same Horizon kit is being used shouldn't we be asking her some very i
searching questions under caution?

Also need to be aware that this case 1s very high profile with several flag cases already and
the MP is involved } understand thal Mrs Stubbs has also joined up with Justice for

POL00106847
POL00106847

Postmasters' who are involved with a court case alleging losses caused by Horizon. Mandy
Talbot in Legal Services has said it is absolutely essential that we have the necessary
information from Fujitsu to support our case in pursuing the outstanding debt. Mrs Stubbs sfill
has some further information that she alleges will support her case but is refusing to let it out
of her sight but this may need to be checked agains! Fujitsu data.

An added complication here is that Mrs Stubbs resigned in May before being suspended in
June and her notice has therefore now expired. An applicant has been interviewed and
offered the appointment but we are concerned at allowing a transfer to go ahead whilst this
debt remains outstanding Advice is being sought from Legal on this

Please advise how this is now to be taken forward.

Has Jason agreed to take this case on, because we don't hand over Horizon logs to a
spmir. It needs an expert to understand what it says, and usually this requires one of
the investigators.

Till give Jason a call in the morning, then I will raise an ARQ from Fujitsu
Is this for our benefit, as there is a cost attached to ARQ requests, we do get a supply

In terms of the points raised we do have a report from the auditor but it is probably @

not detailed enough to cover all the points, so we will probably need to go back on

this as part of the contractual case. In terms of the audit trail via Horizon we are

Hi Lin

Following our conversation I have prepared the attached draft. See what you think,
make any changes and then I will send it out in my name.

o Moving forward, can you confirm what your next steps are re the points she has
raised. I know you are waiting for the audit trail of the transaction events, Re the
comment about the two auditor visits monitoring her work and apparently also having
a problem with the figures, are you obtaining a report from the auditor? If this
escalates we will need to answer the apparent discrepancies in the figures on his
laptop & Horizon.

Finally, when your investigations into the issues she has raised have been completed,
will one of your team be writing to Mrs Stubbs or do you want to channel through
me? If it comes from your team, can they make reference to the letter to David & that
this is the result of investigations into the issues she raised with him. Please advise.

losses

H. sigel @

We are aware of the problems at this branch. The letter suggests she has done all the checks we (& NBSC) would have
suggested. There is not a lot of value I can add as there is nothing recorded that would account for the different losses.

There are no transaction corrections that account for the losses or that should have compensated for them. She has already
checked her transactional records and can see nothing so it is unlikely that customers are suddenly going to start alerting us
to strange deposits into their accounts.

What may or may not be interesting is a £1K TC issued recently for a cash shortage in a rem to the cash centre. One would
have thought with the issues involved that a mistake like this would not have been made without realising. It is possible
they did realise once the rem had gone but smacks of carelessness at least.

If there is anything specific to investigate I am happy to. It may be worth getting something in writing from Fujitsu to
confirm there is nothing that could have failed to have polled/ software anomalies that will come back to bite us. i

This is quickly turning Into a bit of a problem.

This is a potential fraud where losses occurred when a spmr moved into a portacabin, but ceased the moment she was suspended
and somebody else run the office. She did have a clerk, so it could transpire she has nothing to do with the losses, We are talking
about £28k, a potential flag case, with MP's involved. The spmr is questioning the integrity of Horizon.

It looks like contracts/Chesterfield dealt with this themselves, although did speak to investigations. Once I received the paper work
from Nigel, it looks like there are numerous activities that have taken place, including somebody sending in an auditor who sat with
the spmr for haif a day which clearly made matters worse.

I don't know why we were never approached to deal with this as a criminal investigation in the first instance, perhaps it was felt thal
it wasn't at the time. The auditor supposedly witness all transactions for half a day and witness Horizon being short, thereby
corroborating her account and also now a potential witness for her (when in fact clearly he can not have witnessed everything), and
also begs the question as to why it was left ‘high and dry’ at the time and Credence was not checked etc.

T* now leaves us in a very difficult situation. With the spmr writing letters to Dave Smith, her MP and no doubt countless other

pu-_le, this is high profile. She has also joined the spmr’s fight to question the integrity of Horizon. As it stands no investigation @
has taken place by us, various intervention has probably complicated this, yet because it is a question of Horizon integrity we can't

simply ignore it, or drop it, but probably have some difficult questions ahead of us in terms of why has it taken so long for us to

consider this criminal if this is the course of action we take.

What we're trying to determine here is whether there is any discrepancy between the information sent in to the Live Service team by

the spmr, Mrs Stubbs, and what the Horizon system is showing. She is alleging that her losses of £28k+ are due to problems with
the Horizon system after it was relocated into a portacabin last October whilst the branch was being renovated.

Can you advise whether a case is being raised on this? Given the fact that we have not experienced similar losses with the
‘temporary spmr who was appointed after Mrs Stubbs was suspended and the same Horizon kit is being used, shouldn't we be
asking her some very searching questions under caution?

Redacted

An added complication here is that Mrs Stubbs resigned in May before being suspended in June and her notice has therefore now
expired. An applicant has been interviewed and offered the appointment but we are concerned at allowing a transfer to go ahead
whilst this debt remains outstanding. [7 Redacted I

Thanks for the update.

Once the outcome is known, I will communicate this to Mrs Stubbs although I will be on hols from next week for two weeks, so will

Nigel, we are hoping to get the data asap following a delay in getting ARQ's from Fujitsu.

I'm on A/L now for 2 weeks, so Jane will fire this over when she gets it. Obviously we can't hand the data to the SPMR, will you be

handling disclosing what we are able to.

This branch has a very large loss which the spmr is attributing to Horizon. We have already had one Flag case on this and
this will remain high profile so the data does need to be retrieved.

Nigel, no probs with requesting data from Fujitsu, but it will take around 3 weeks. Has Jason agreed to take this case on,
because we don't hand over Horizon logs to a spmr. It needs an expert to understand what it says, and usually this requires
@ one of the investigators.

Tl give Jason a call in the morning, then I will raise an ARQ from Fujitsu

Is this for our benefit, as there is a cost attached to ARQ requests, we do get a supply free of charge as part of the contract
but we usually don't have enough, therefore we usually charge the defence lawyers.

We e currently in dispute re debts owing by this branch and to bring the matter to a close need to present information
which disproves the spmrs assertion that horizon is generating errors. Please see dates and requirements below, could you
confirm if Fujitsu will provide via ARQ and whether all requests can be met.

Nigel as discussed I can only request logs for specific queries as the transaction logs in themselves do not amount to
evidence.

Thave changed it slightly.

In terms of the points raised we do have a report from the auditor but it is probably not detailed enough to cover all the

points, so we will probably need to go back on this as part of the contractual case. In terms of the audit trail via Horizon

‘we are waiting for Mark Dinsdale to authorise the case as he holds the budget. GS
Nix has today referred the case to Jason Collins requesting their involvement given the level of losses - I will forward e-

mail separately. Need to see where this gets us before we can move the case forward or start to answer her detailed

questions.

HiLin :

Following our conversation I have prepared the attached draft. See what you think, make any changes and then I will send it
out in my name.

Moving forward, can you confirm what your next steps are re the points she has raised. I know you are waiting for the audit
trail of the transaction events. Re the comment about the two auditor visits monitoring her work and apparently also
having a problem with the figures, are you obtaining a report from the auditor? If this escalates we will need to answer the
apparent discrepancies in the figures on his laptop & Horizon.

Finally, when your investigations into the issues she has raised have been completed, will one of your team be writing to Mrs
Stubbs or do you want to channel through me? [f it comes from your team, can they make reference to the letter to David
& that this is the result of investigations into the issues she raised with him. Please advise.

Thanks !
