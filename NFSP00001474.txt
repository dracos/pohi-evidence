Ruth

Thank you for the information below. This is helpful and we will use this to identify the agenda items. I will
share this with you week beginning 9" Dec after the Cabinet Secretary and Lord Advocate have had an
opportunity to consider.

Can you confirm who will attend from NFSP? We need to inform the Scottish Parliament about guests and
assess room capacity.

I wondered if you might wish to meet with myself after the meeting to discuss more pragmatic/ operational
aspects of the work. It would be helpful for me to better understand how the NFSP is supporting
Postmasters and how we can work with you to ensure that we are meeting any needs that might be arising
from the quashed conviction notifications.

If you are content to meet, then we could perhaps grab a coffee and seat in the lobby at 11am once our
meeting with the Ministers has concluded?

Good morning Saira,

Thank you for your email regarding an agenda for our meeting with the Cabinet Secretary and Lord
Advocate on 12'" December. Our letter of 16 January 2024 to the First Minister and our email to the
Cabinet Secretary of 19 April 2024 raised the main points which the NFSP are interested in and would wish
to discuss. We appreciate things have moved on somewhat since that correspondence, both legally in
Scotland and at the Inquiry. That being so, we would be grateful if the following could be on the agenda:

+ The number of actual prosecutions which took place in Scotland and which are or will be covered
by the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences (Scotland) Act 2024, the process for the quashing of
convictions, numbers quashed to date, timescales for the quashing of all convictions which fall within
NFSP00001474
NFSP00001474

the scope of the 2024 Act

+ The consideration being given to the timescales for the quashing of convictions to ensure that no
convicted postmasters fall out with any deadlines which may be imposed in respect of the Overturned
Convictions Compensation Scheme. Also, in respect of those who are either suffering ill health or
where their families members are suffering ill health, in other words, where quashing of convictions
may come too late for people to be aware they have been quashed.

+ How it was that Scotland criminal legal system with its apparently additional safeguards and layers
of the Specialist Reporting Agency reports, corroboration requirements and consideration of evidence
by the relevant Procurator Fiscal didn’t identify or catch Horizon cases at an earlier point, given the
simplified comparative private prosecution procedure in England which does not have these
requirements/procedures

+ What it was that the Crown Office was saying to or advising Fiscals across Scotland regarding
Horizon prosecutions and why it was that COPFS decided to stop prosecutions (in terms of notifying
Post Office of this, resulting in the meeting between Post Office personnel and COPFS in 2013).

+ The consideration being given to requesting enquires/investigation by Police Scotland in respect of
any criminal offences which may have taken place by individuals at or related to Post Office Ltd in
respect of matters such as truthfulness of information given at meeting/s with COPFS, forcing
postmasters to make payment to Post Office of shortfalls which were not contractually required and
related issues, for instance, with reference to the point made by the leader of Scottish Labour, Anas
Sarwar that offences such as extortion may have been committed

We appreciate that issues around these points, in light of our earlier correspondence, will likely be crossing
over with your points and we look forward to an informative meeting. The NFSP is committed to assisting
the Scottish Government/COPFS in any way it can with information which may assist in any of the above
points.

Regards

Ruth

Hi Ruth

As Stuart says it would be helpful for us to discuss the agenda and to provide any additional
information you might find helpful ahead of the meeting. I can also liaise with Crown Office.

Are you free next week — Thursday? I can provide a draft agenda for us to consider in advance?

A meeting in person would be the preference, therefore, I am more than happy to bow out so that an online
option is not necessary.

Hi Ruth

Many thanks, just to confirm that 10.00am on 12 December is still good for both Ms Constance and the
Lord Advocate.

I can try and book a meeting room that has Teams facilities but they can sometimes be difficult to secure. If
you think that a meeting entirely virtual is easiest for yourselves we can certainly do that - let me know what
preference is for you and your colleagues.

Thanks again.

Hello,

Thank you for your email of the 8° November, and we note that the original did not reach for the reasons
you give.

Due to our involvement with the Post Office Horizon IT Public Inquiry, I can confirm that the date of 12th
December at 10am is suitable for us and we would be happy to meet in person at the Scottish Parliament.
This would include Calum Greenhow, NFSP CEO, Catriona Watt and Rohini Shah, our legal
representatives at Anderson Strathern. I am based in Shoreham so would require video access. Please let
know if this is an issue.

Regards,

Ruth

Hi Ruth

I am following up on the email below from my colleague Kate. I have since discovered that our office had
been given an incorrect email address for yourself (getting letters in “nfsp” incorrect) as highlighted below. I
am therefore re-sending with our apologies and wonder whether either of the dates listed below are
possible. Happy to look at alternative dates if required.

Apologies again. It would be helpful if you could acknowledge safe receipt of this letter.

Many thanks.
