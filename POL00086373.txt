All,
Please see the following update for ACC 12/2009 from Paul Inwood.
A point of clarification with regards to the above ACC.

You will note that the various letters embedded in the document state that POL will attempt to
provide Post Office services by the most appropriate means available, and where we discuss the
possible introduction of a PO essentials offer, we say that is our preferred option. You may also
have noted from the text of the ACC that we say that we may deploy new operating models in
communities, and talk about possible outcomes.

For the avoidance of any doubt,this could be taken to read that we would interview applicants
who wish to apply on the basis of the subpostmaster operating model i.e. we are not precluding
anyone from applying on the basis of the operating model they propose.

At the interview stage, we will seek to appoint the applicant who, in our opinion, has the best
overall proposition for POL.

Please ensure that this clarification is made clear to those in your team who need to see it.

Regards
Brian
