1 Introduction

Information is an asset which, like other important business assets, has value to an organisation
and consequently needs to be suitably protected. Information security protects information from
a wide range of threats in order to safeguard customers and staff, ensure business continuity,
minimise business damage and maximise operational efficiency.

Information can exist in many forms. It can be printed or written on paper, stored electronically,
transmitted by post or using electronic means, shown on films, or spoken in conversation.
Whatever forms the information takes, or means by which it is shared or stored, it should always
be appropriately protected and is subject to the provisions of this policy document.

Information security is characterised here as the preservation of:

e Confidentiality: ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorised to have
access;

e Integrity: safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing
methods;

e Availability: ensuring that authorised users have access to information and associated
assets when required.

Information security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of countermeasures, including
policies, practices, procedures, organisational structures and technical measures. Therefore by
using an Information Security Management System (ISMS), this provides a systematic approach
to managing sensitive company information so that it remains secure. It also encompasses
people, processes and IT systems

2 Information Security Policy

1. The purpose of this policy is to define how Information Security is managed, within the
framework of this ISMS

2. The purpose of Information Security Management is to provide an appropriate level of
protection for information assets from relevant threats, whether internal or external,
deliberate or accidental. The implementation of this policy is important to maintain our
integrity as a supplier of services to stakeholders.

3. It is the policy of the POA to ensure that:
a. The requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2005 are effectively addressed
b. Information will be protected against unauthorised access.
c. Confidentiality of information will be maintained.
d

Information will not be disclosed to unauthorised persons through deliberate or
careless action.

e. Integrity of information is assured through protection from unauthorised modification.
f. Information is available to authorised users when needed.
g. Regulatory and legislative requirements will be met.
h. Information security training will be provided to all staff.

of the functions / services within scope. A list of the identified asset classes can be found in
Schedule B.

62 Risk Treatment Plan

For all risks where the residual risk is identified within Acuity Stream as amber / red an action will
be recorded, for further containment to reduce the residual risk to an acceptable level. These
actions when consolidated into a report will be considered as the risk treatment plan (RTP).

The risk treatment report will identify for each risk requiring treatment:
e its pre-action data is recorded from the risk register;
e the risk option is decided
e risk treatment action[s] are determined and recorded;
* post action scoring is undertaken
¢ next review / milestone dates are documented

The RTP is subject to regular review by the POA CISO/ISMF, in conjunction with the risk
owners.

There are several options available to senior management when considering what to do about
identified risks. The chosen option (or mix of management techniques) will depend on the
nature and level of the risk.

The key options are:
e Risk Acceptance:

For low-frequency, low-impact risks, where the cost of control is greater than the potential
risk, CU management will choose to accept such risks.

° Risk Avoidance:

Where an activity generates a risk, and the CU has the option to cease the particular activity
or to conduct the process in a different way, then they may choose to do so in order to avoid
the risk concerned.

e Risk Reduction/Mitigation:

Where the level of risk is unacceptable, management will employ controls in order to
manage that risk down to acceptable levels, either by mitigating the impact, or reducing the
vulnerability/likelinood. Lower impact risks will be kept under review to ensure that the trend
is not increasing, or the cumulative impact is not unacceptable.

¢ Risk Transfer:

In circumstance of potential catastrophic loss, with low probability (such as complete loss of
data centre), management will opt to transfer the risk to other parties, facilities or services.

6.4 Statement of Applicability

The ISMS Statement of Applicability illustrates the:

1) control objectives and controls selected together with the reasons for their selection;

2) control objectives and controls currently implemented; and

3) exclusion of any control objectives and controls and the justification for their exclusion.
