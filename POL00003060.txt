6.2 ATM Retracts

Background
ATM (PostOffice + Bank of Ireland machines) retracts the cash that is being dispensed by customer back into the machines. This is due to “time out”, if the
physical cash is not taken within 59 seconds the ATM retracts the money and put in a “retract” tray within the machine. Customer account has been debited.

If there are communication failures on the machine, it can also happen that cash is never dispensed, however the customer account has been debited. A
surplus can also consist of a combination of retracts and communication failures etc.

Bank of Ireland normally refunds customer within 3-5 WD.

(Chronological steps in the process:
I1. Camelot sends report SRC (contains volumes of sales, prizes etc.) to PostOffice (check who in Postoffice receive this report??) (CAMELOT)
2. PostOffice uploads report SRC into CREDENCE (PostOffice which team?)
3. CREDENCE interface to POLSAP (CREDENCE)
4. POLSAP interface HORIZON (POLSAP)
5. One G/L account 627012 — contains prizes (POLSAP)
6. Choose group of Branches (A, B, C, D) where each group represents roughly 4000 branches (Lottery team)
7, Each morning retrieve the CAMELOT file and rename to : CAMdd.mm.yy in POLSAP (Lottery team)
8. Weekly rename the CAMdd.mm.yy files for TC issue — rename to TE OPEN (the TE OPEN contains the total of all errors across all groups (A B C D)
(Lottery team)
9. Run POLSAP G/L Acc Line Item with variant “SALES PRIZE”, (Lottery team)
I10. Download report to Excel — report shows FAD code for Branch and total amount of errors associated with the Branch, (Lottery team)
\14. For each group (ABCD) rename the TE OPEN to “6yyyy/mm/dd/P X (P=period) (X=group) (POLSAP), this splits the TE OPEN file as per step 8 into
individual errors per group (A B C D), (Lottery team)
I12. For each group (ABCD) rename the HORIZON file in POLSAP to “6yyyy/mm/dd/P X (P=period) (X=group) this splits the HORIZON file into individual
errors per group (A B C D), (Lottery team)
a) Knut: how do you identify the total TE open into groups? Its via Branch lookup, where each Branch is identified as group A BC or D.
b) Knut: How do you identify the HORIZON file to be renamed? (search in POLSAP for file “TE OPEN” and a date range of Month month.)
(13. Does POLSAP do any automatic matching within the file as it now has identical file names originating from 2 sources (HORIZON and POLSAP) (No
matching, however POLSAP now gives the total open per Branch, etc. Credits from CAMELOT postings and Debits from HORIZON.
44. Anything less than 1 GBP (Deb/cr.) no TC is issued, (Lottery team)
a) Knut: How are amounts less than £1 being written off?
(45. Select from spreadsheet amounts over GBP 300, (Lottery team)
a) Knut: Is that just the priority? Cheque value starts normally at GBP300
(16. Type in FAD code into POLSAP G/L acc display to bring up the total error, (Lottery team)
47. Identify error (open item) in Trading period
118. Fillin template for TCs (spreadsheet “Group x period yyyy” (stored on Sharepoint)
149. TCs are issued monthly per Branch (per Group), working on a group per week so each group is covered during the month.
20. POLSAP screen “automatic TC correction” — meaning POLSAP uploads from TC template and posts automatically all TC’s that has been filled.
23. Run first in Test run
22. When test run is successful — run in normal mode
