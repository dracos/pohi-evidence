2.1.4

Post Office may appoint Fujitsu Services as Preferred Systems Integrator in
accordance with the provisions of Schedule A1. If Fujitsu Services is appointed
as Preferred Systems Integrator, the terms upon which Fujitsu Services assumes
responsibility for any Relevant IT Systems designated by Post Office shall, as
specified in Schedule A1, be agreed under the Change Control Procedure save
that work required to develop any interfaces required between the Relevant IT
Systems and the Infrastructure or other Systems Integration may be, and where
paragraph 2.1.2 applies shall be, provided under a Work Order as H&HNG
Systems Integration in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

Whether or not Fujitsu Services or any third party is appointed as the Preferred
Systems Integrator and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Schedule A1
or this Schedule B1.1, Fujitsu Services shall, throughout the term of this
Agreement, be the exclusive provider to Post Office of:

2.1.2.1 H&HNG Systems Integration described in paragraph 3.1.3.2; and

2.1.2.2 those elements of Hardware Implementation identified in the Annex to
Schedule B1.3 as Hardware Implementation that Fujitsu Services (and
not Post Office or a third party) is entitled to provide, to the extent that
such Hardware Implementation relates to the Infrastructure.

The terms on which Fujitsu Services supplies the services referred to in
paragraph 2.1.2 shall be set out in one or more Work Orders in accordance with
the provisions of this Schedule and the Work Ordering Procedure.

For the avoidance of doubt, the only exclusivity granted to Fujitsu Services under
this Schedule B1.1 is set out in paragraph 2.1.2 of this Schedule.

2.2 Application Procurement principles

2.2.1

2.2.2

2.2.3

Where Post Office requires additional functionality to be integrated within the
Infrastructure or Post Office Cloud it will, wherever practicable and cost effective
(and subject to paragraph 2.2.3) provide such functionality by procuring standard
(commercial off the shelf) applications or Application Services from Fujitsu
Services or a third party software provider rather than carrying out bespoke
software development.

Notwithstanding paragraph 2.2.1, where standard applications or Application
Services are not available or not suitable, Post Office may:

2.2.2.1 procure a bespoke application from a third party; or
2.2.2.2 procure a bespoke application from Fujitsu Services.
Subject to paragraph 2.2.4, the selection and deployment of any third party

standard applications or Applications Services or third party bespoke applications.
or Applications Services is subject to joint:

compatibility and ability to interface with the Infrastructure, the Horizon
Applications and/or the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities;

2.2.3.2 assessment of the impact on the Infrastructure (including the costs of
implementation) and the HNG-X Services (including the Service Levels
and any limitations on liability). The impact assessment will consider any
operational risks, Service Level lets or caveats which may be
necessitated by the architecture;

2.2.3.3 review of the availability of suitable support capability;

2.2.3.4 assessment against Post Office IT and business strategies and long term
operating costs; and

2.2.3.5 identification of any additional existing documentation that Post Office
requires from Fujitsu Services to facilitate Post Office's assessment of
the standard or third party application.

by Post Office and Fujitsu Services.

The verification, assessment and review activities referred to in paragraph 2.2.3
shall utilise the SIP to the extent decided by the Systems Integration Partnership
and Executive Relationship, but Fujitsu Services’ involvement shall otherwise be
subject to a Work Order agreed under the Work Ordering Procedure.

Where Post Office chooses to procure a standard or bespoke application from
Fujitsu Services the terms on which it does so shall be set out in one or more
Work Orders in accordance with the Work Ordering Procedure and the provisions
of paragraphs 4 and 5 below.

Where Post Office chooses to procure a standard or bespoke application from a
third party, the commercial and contractual relationship between Post Office,
Fujitsu Services and any third party application or Application Service provider
(including the charges payable to Fujitsu Services) shall be agreed on a case by
case basis. The Parties may adopt whatever commercial and/or contractual
structure is appropriate for the particular circumstances. However, the
commercial and contractual arrangement must take reasonable account of the
impact on the systems and services provided to Post Office by Fujitsu Services.

Fujitsu Services shall not unreasonably refuse to integrate third party applications
or Applications Services into the Infrastructure, taking into account the proposed
commercial terms and the impact such integration will have on the systems and
services provided to Post Office by Fujitsu Services.

Development Methodology agreed by the Parties as most suitable for successfully
delivering the development project in question. The Development Methodology to be
used for each development project shall:

4.2.1 be agreed by the Parties no later than the end of the Requirements Stage (as
described in paragraph 5.4.1) +for that development project;

4.2.2 — shall, as a minimum, set out the approach to the Development Lifecycle Stages
(including how the processes and disciplines of the Development Methodology
map to the generic Development Lifecycle and Development Lifecycle Stages)
and the Artefacts to be produced at each Development Lifecycle Stage for that
development project, by each Party; and

4.2.3 shall be developed to be consistent with RMG Harmony (so as not to prevent the
use by Post Office of RMG Harmony in relation to that development project.)

Post Office shall be responsible for documenting the Development Methodology agreed
for each development project.

Development Services to be undertaken by Fujitsu Services must be ordered as Work
Orders in accordance with the provisions of Schedule D2. The terms of such Work
Orders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5
unless either paragraph 2.2.6 or paragraph 6 applies, in which case the terms of such
Work Orders shall be determined in accordance with paragraph 2.2.6 or 6 respectively.

The basis for development resource planning of Work Packages shall be the
Development Lifecycle Stages.

The following principles shall be applicable to contracting for Development Services
between Post Office and Fujitsu Services:

4.5.1 clear control for each Development Lifecycle Stage and the responsibility to
deliver associated deliverables will be specified and agreed between the Parties
as vesting in either Post Office or Fujitsu Services but not both;

4.5.2 business control of Work Packages shall be established in accordance with the
governance principles set out in Schedule A2 and the Work Ordering Procedure
in Schedule D2 and each large Work Package will have a senior management
sponsor within both Fujitsu Services and Post Office; and

4.5.3 related responsibilities shall be clearly identified and assigned to specific
individuals in Fujitsu Services or Post Office.

Where the scope and size of a Work Package are substantial, Post Office may request
Fujitsu Services to identify as separable components of work individual Work Package
Elements which could be carried out by third parties under Fujitsu Services' management.
Where this option is considered, Fujitsu Services will identify any liability, performance,

reliability or other potential service implications of such option and the terms to be
incorporated into a subcontract for such work.

THE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE

Initial Development Lifecycle Stages

The following Development Lifecycle Stages will be led by Post Office who may procure
professional services (as described in paragraph 3.1.1) from Fujitsu Services to support
the work done in the relevant Development Lifecycle Stage.

5.1.1 Strategic Approval Stage, which defines the strategic and architectural framework
within which the changes are to be developed and delivered.

5.1.2 Start-up and Feasibility Stage, in which Post Office develops an outline view of a
potential business requirement with input, where required, from Fujitsu Services:

5.1.2.1 on the indicative cost range for the provision of a potential solution, to
assist Post Office in making an informed decision on:

(a) the business case for proceeding to later stages of the
Development Lifecycle; and

(b) sourcing of solution components; and

5.1.2.2 to assist with an assessment of the most appropriate Development
Methodology to be adopted (with this Development Methodology being
confirmed during the Requirements Stage by the Systems Integration
Partnership); and

5.1.2.3 to give an indication of the scope of any work that Fujitsu Services
proposes be undertaken by any Sub-contractor located outside the
United Kingdom (with this being confirmed during the Solution Definition
Stage).

A key objective of these two Development Lifecycle Stages is to provide sufficient
information to Post Office such that it can make an informed decision about the
procurement approach in respect of the development project as a whole and each
solution component. Post Office shall consider the procurement options by reference to
the provisions of Schedule B1.3 and paragraphs 4.6 and 6 of this Schedule B1.1 before a
decision is made by Post Office on whether it will involve Fujitsu Services in the later
Development Lifecycle Stages or in procuring subcontractors in accordance with
paragraph 4.6, or adopt a competitive approach in accordance with paragraph 6.

Subsequent Development Lifecycle Stages where Development Services are procured
from Fujitsu Services

If Fujitsu Services is required to provide Development Services after the Strategic
Approval Stage and the Start-up and Feasibility Stage and a competitive approach is not
adopted by Post Office as described in paragraph 6 of this Schedule B1.1, the remaining
provisions of this paragraph 5 shall be applicable.

The Development Lifecycle Stages that (subject to paragraphs 4.2 and 5.5) shall apply
after the Strategic Approval Stage and the Start-up and Feasibility Stage are described
below.

5.4.1 Requirements Stage, in which production of a full specification of the
requirements and Work Packages is led and managed by Post Office to form the
basis for solution specification and any subsequent contract for development,
implementation, acceptance and operational work.

5.4.2 Solution Definition Stage, managed by Fujitsu Services, in which Fujitsu Services
produces (i) a solution description as defined in the applicable Development
Methodology setting out the proposed solution in response to the Post Office's
Work Package requirements including any qualifications and caveats applicable
to those requirements and (ii) Change Work Orders detailing the price and
contractual terms applicable to the subsequent Development Lifecycle Stages
(and those applicable to any subsequent stage relating to operational service if
not dealt with in an associated CCN), including confirmation of the details and
scope of any work to be undertaken by any Sub-contractor located outside the
United Kingdom (together with the identity of any such Sub-contractor).

5.4.3 Solution Build and Test Stage, managed by Fujitsu Services, in which Fujitsu
Services undertakes the development, integration and testing of the solution
Work Package (other than any user testing or release validation testing or
elements of solution assurance which will be managed by Post Office) up to, and
including, its acceptance by Post Office.

5.4.4 Implementation Stage, managed by Fujitsu Services, in which Fujitsu Services
undertakes system and software rollout into the live environment (any necessary
Implementation of Branch Hardware having been carried out in accordance with
Schedule B1.3 and, as applicable, this Schedule) together with related planning
and change management, up to acceptance of the solution into live service. Post
Office related business implementation aspects shall be managed by Post Office.

In order to optimise the Development Lifecycle, Development Lifecycle Stages may
overlap or occur in parallel, be combined or, in exceptional cases, omitted. The method of
operation of the Development Lifecycle Stages for each development project will be set
out in the Development Methodology as agreed and documented in accordance with
paragraph 4.2.

Office to consider such proposals and shall seek Post Office agreement to these
proposals before they are implemented, such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld. The decision to offshore the development of a component will be based on
information that will include architectural considerations, skills availability, development
knowledge, support constraints and security measures.

Before Fujitsu Services proposes to Post Office, pursuant to paragraph 5.13, that any
development work be undertaken offshore, Fujitsu Services shall, at no cost to the Post
Office, carry out an assessment of the potential risks involved in such work being
undertaken offshore. Such assessment shall consider any potential risks arising from the
physical, logical and management security standards to be followed by the offshore
developer undertaking such work.

Fujitsu Services shall disclose to Post Office (a) the results of the assessment referred to
in paragraph 5.14 and (b) details of the processes, procedures, systems and controls it
has or intends to put in place to address the risks identified in that assessment. The
commencement of any offshore development work shall be conditional on Post Office
confirming to Fujitsu Services that it is satisfied with such assessment and such
processes, procedures, systems and controls.

In the event that the Parties agree that it is necessary for the offshore developer to be
required to put in place any of the following security measures in respect of any
development work undertaken by it offshore:

(a) physically isolating its development environment for the development work
commissioned by Fujitsu Services on behalf of the Post Office from other areas,
with access restricted to only those resources of the offshore developer who are
carrying out such activities; and

(b) isolating the offshore developer's networks for such development environment
from other areas and other networks including data security, network security,
server security, document security and web security; then

as part of any such agreement, the Parties shall also agree any additional charges to be
paid by Post Office for those measures, such charges to reflect any additional costs
incurred by the offshore developer in implementing those measures.

Fujitsu Services shall be responsible for ensuring that the offshore developer implements
and observes any security measures disclosed to Post Office pursuant to paragraph
15.13 (to the extent they are relevant to the offshore developer) or agreed by the Parties
pursuant to paragraph 5.16. Other than as referred to in paragraph 5.16, the cost of such
security measures shall be borne by Fujitsu Services.

COMPETITIVE APPROACH

Having undertaken the Strategic Approval Stage and the Start-up and Feasibility Stage,
Post Office may decide to adopt a competitive approach for the development project in
which case the terms on which any subsequent Development Services are provided by
Fujitsu Services in relation to that development project will be determined through a
competitive process. Post Office shall specify the requirements and processes to be

applied to such competitive procurement, dividing the tasks into Work Packages which
may replicate the Development Lifecycle Stages.

If Post Office decides to adopt a competitive approach, the following provisions shall
apply:

6.2.1 If paragraph 2.1.2 applies in respect of a Work Package, Post Office shall procure
that Work Package from Fujitsu Services.

6.2.2 If Fujitsu Services has been appointed as the Preferred Systems Integrator and a
Work Package involves Systems Integration then, unless paragraph 2.1.2 applies,
Fujitsu Services shall be invited to compete for that Work Package in accordance
with paragraph 3.6 of Schedule A1.

6.2.3 In all other cases, Fujitsu Services shall not unreasonably be refused by Post
Office an opportunity to compete for any of the Work Packages.

All Work Packages awarded to Fujitsu Services as part of the competitive process
envisaged by this paragraph shall be procured by Work Order agreed under the Work
Ordering Procedure. Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the provisions of paragraph 5.6
to 5.12 shall apply in relation to such Work Orders.

Post Office shall, with assistance from Fujitsu Services in relation to Work Packages
awarded to Fujitsu Services, plan the stages involved in development work in order to
achieve appropriate time to market that may involve overlapping stages between Post
