Please note that the base unit swap will be a total waste of time and money.

yne problem is in transaction Recovery software which we are currently looking at.

Whe work around is to delete this session from branch database which is causing this problem. But we need approval from Post
ffice in order to delete this session causing the problem.

the authorisation request was sent via ATOS but so far no response has been received.

Inless this session is deleted Node:4 will remain unusable.

Please advise ATOS that we need formal POL authorisation and NOT sub-postmasters authorisation. We can not accept Sub-

I have referred this matter to our Operations Security Manager to raise with POL Security as I have not seen any documented
process to support this and I?m not comfortable Atos Desk taking instruction from a branch to remove transactions as I?m unsure
@ are authorised to do this ? for example how would we even validate who the PM is. With all the issues relating to Second
Sight, T just vant to make sure we have an agreed process that POL Security have agreed to. In the meantime, if this is an
xisting process, can you provide me with a copy please.

Problem Identified:This call is identical to

ccording to counter log, there were two transactions in the session 4-520273.

1. Health Lottery tun 00-269323-4-4536296 -1
2. Banking txn 00-269323-4-4536297 -1

‘he settlement failed due to poor communication with the data centre (Network issue) and user was logged out by the system.

POL00002492

When the user logged back in, the recovery kicked-in. But the recovery of the Health Lottery txn 00-269323-4-4536296 -1 failed.
s the recovery failed, user was/in unable to logon to Node:4

I have asked POL (via ATOS) to authorise us to remove the Health Lottery txn 00-269323-4-4536296 -1 which is preventing
successful recovery. It is not clear when (if) authorisation will arrive. Until then Node:4 will NOT be usable.

LOG : Update from Atos
cood afternoon,

Regarding your advice on the incident 16809136/A7701255

lasked to get POL to formally authorise Fujitsu to delete this Health Lottery session so that office 1s able to use Node:4 again.
This will enable the office to use Node:4 again quickly

If nothing is done then after 5 days both txns will enter into failed transaction state and will have to be removed manually.

Please advise POL that POA Development investigations lead us to believe that the AP ADC Script developed in Post Office domain
may be the underlying cause of the issue.

I have referred this matter to our Operations Security Manager to raise with POL Security as I have not seen any documented
process to support this and I?m not comfortable Atos Desk taking instruction from a branch to remove transactions as I?m unsure
We are authorised to do this ? for example how would we even validate who the PM is. With all the issues relating to Second
‘ight, I just want to make sure we have an agreed process that POL Security have agreed to. In the meantime, if this is an
existing process, can you provide me with a copy p.

SU please do the necessary reconciliation for the following:

This office was doing the following cash withdrawal txn for £70.66 on 23/2/15 @10:46.
Whe session also contained a non financial Health Lottery txn.

Whe settlement failed due to poor communication with the data centre. The disconnected session receipts were printed which
‘advised PM to pay the money out. Spoke to PM who confirmed that the money exchanged hands.

Ihnen PM tried to log back the recovery kicked-in. However the Health Lottery APADC recovery script failed and left counter
unusable .

esterday POL Branch Support team authorised us to remove/update the session.

‘Today I have carried out and completed the task. PM is now able to use the node again.
econciliation needed for the banking transaction:

The cash withdrawal txn was authorised and PM said they paid the money out.

this will leave this office £70.66 short (cash shortage) as the session not completed fully.
POL need to do appropriate reconciliation; transaction correction

SU: Please send the call back to me once BIMs have been raised.
