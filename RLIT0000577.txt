2. Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme

Out of the 555 who were members of the Group Litigation Order, 63
postmasters had convictions and are therefore eligible to apply for redress
once their conviction has been overturned. If their conviction has been
overturned by the courts, they are eligible under the Overturned Convictions
(OC) Scheme. If their conviction has been overturned by the legislation,
they are eligible for the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS).

As of 21 February, the department had received 425 completed claims from
eligible GLO postmasters. Full and final redress has been agreed with 269
claimants, of whom 153 accepted the £75,000 fixed offer. A further 219
individuals have received partial or interim redress payments, including
people who have not yet submitted full claims.

2.1 Full and final claimant stages

There are 492 claimants eligible for financial redress through

the GLO scheme. As of 21 February 2025, 425 full and final claims have
been received. For full and final claims received, the number reported refers
to all claims assessed as complete. Further claims may have been received
recently but not yet assessed to determine whether they are complete. A
claim initially assessed as complete may subsequently be found to require
further information and therefore be removed from counts of complete
claims received while awaiting this information.

Of these 425 claims, 265 have been paid and a further 4 have accepted
offers and are awaiting payment. Another 138 postmasters have received
offers from the department and the remaining 18 are awaiting offers.

2.2 Scheme delivery target

The Department for Business and Trade is committed to a target of making
a first offer to 90% of claimants who have submitted a full claim within 40
working days. A full claim is defined as a claim which the department
considers, with advice from its legal advisors, does not need any further
evidence in order to assess every element of the claim. Should the
department consider further evidence is needed in order to make a full
assessment, the 40 working day target will not start until such time that the
required evidence is received from the claimant or any other source.

Over the lifetime of the scheme to 21 February 2025, 89% of claimants
received their first offer within 40 working days of submitting a full claim.

The Department for Business and Trade’s target is providing a substantive
response within 40 working days to 90% of claimants who submit a
complete challenge from 1 December 2024. A challenge will be considered
‘complete’ if the department does not require any more information from the
claimant or their advisors in order to provide a substantive response. A
RLIT0000577
RLIT0000577

substantive response is defined as the claimant receiving a revised offer or
a decision to uphold the original offer.

As of 21 February 2025, 95% of claimants (18 out of 19) who submitted
complete challenges after 1 December received their substantive response
within 40 working days of doing so. Claims are being assessed in the date
order in which they were submitted, so no challenge submitted before 1
December will be left behind.

2.3 £75,000 fixed payment impact

Due to changes made in January 2024, all eligible GLO claimants are now
offered the option to settle their claims on a full and final basis for a total
fixed sum of £75,000 inclusive of interest, instead of making a claim for their
individual losses.

This means that the claim would not be assessed by the department against
the process set out in the guidance and principles
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compensation-scheme-for-group-
litigation-order-case-postmasters).

Any payments received from the department to date or from
the GLO settlement will be deducted from the £75,000 before payment is
made.

As of 21 February 2025, 269 offers have been accepted, of which 153 are
offers of the £75,000 fixed payment. Of those who have accepted the
£75,000 fixed payment, four-fifths are new claims and a fifth had previously
accepted offers.

3. Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme
(HCRS)

The Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 and the Post Office
(Horizon System) Offences (Scotland) Act 2024 quashed Horizon-related
convictions on a blanket basis in June 2024, according to a set of criteria in
the Acts, covering each UK nation.

On 30 July 2024, the UK government announced the launch of the Horizon
Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS) (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/horizon-
convictions-redress-scheme-hcrs-applying-for-financial-redress), delivered by the

RLIT0000577
RLIT0000577

Department for Business and Trade, to provide financial redress to
postmasters across the UK who had their convictions quashed by the Acts.

Applicants have begun registering for the HCRS and the department is
working with the relevant justice authorities to confirm individual applicants’
eligibility for the scheme.

Eligible applicants have a choice of 2 routes to redress: they can either
accept a fixed and final sum of £600,000, or they can choose to submit their
application to a detailed assessment process.

All eligible applicants are entitled to an initial interim payment of £200,000.

The department is now publishing data on settlements, broken down by
initial interim payments and full and final settlements.

3.1 Full and final claimant stages

As of 21 February 2025, 273 full and final claims for financial redress have
been received via the HCRS. Of these 273 claims, 257 have received
payments and the remaining 16 have accepted offers for redress and are
awaiting payment from the department.
