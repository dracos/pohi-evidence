To see the below email with thanks from Alex Chisholm and also to be aware that:

1. There continues to be some noise around the settlement — see for example at the below link which includes
a call for a public inquiry “that could at least question former ministers, civil servants and Post Office executives,
past and present”

https://ukcampaign4change.com/2019/12/12/how-did-ministers-and-the-civil-service-let-the-post-office-

behave-like-this/

2. Judgment on the reliability of the Horizon system will be made public at 2pm on Monday. Although it does
not affect the settlement it is likely to have further criticism of POL and generate more noise

POL are aware of what the judgment says and have put in place Comms and other contingency plans.
Kind regards
Richard

I have issued thanks to the Post Office team after the successful resolution of the litigation earlier this week, but I
wanted to drop you a short line as well to express my thanks for your contributions.

It hasn't been an easy ride, but I felt that you had a firm grip especially at the crucial moments and that always gave
me confidence that things were moving in the right direction.
