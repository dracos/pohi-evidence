land left the session running, therefore Automatic system logout occurred. It
jsppears that the system did not complete the txn tidily after the forced
flogout which occurs after 55 minutes of activity.

Its a result, the selected transfer could not be completed, as it was

rrently being processed by another user, i.e.

lpparently the discrepancy will keep appearing each week until the amount
committed to the Suspense Account. There is little point in Development
Irying to manually tweak the messagestore to remove this problem as the
damage was done when the first discrepan epted. Now the problem is

Piease see earlier evidence and comments on this bug. I think a third party
