I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account since May 2005. I perform the
role of Service Delivery Manager and am responsible for service delivery of all Post Office
change. I have working knowledge of the computer system known as Horizon, which is a
computerised accounting system used by Post Office Ltd and knowledge of the processes

used when Horizon kit is uplifted from closing Post Office Branches.

Horizon’s documented procedures stipulate how the Horizon System operates, and while I am
not involved with any of the technical aspects of the Horizon System, these documented
processes allow me to provide a general overview.

The serial number of the Gateway PC base unit at West Byfleet Branch (FAD Code 126023) is
YBSHO011567 and I have documentation from Triage Services confirming repair and software
reload of this unit prior to its deployment to the West Byfleet Branch.

On arrival at Triage Services on the 23rd of January 2008 base unit YBSH011567 was

subjected to a standard clean, test, and application reinstallation as per standard process,
Triage Services state that no malfunctions were found and as a result no repairs were carried
out to this unit and it was placed in storage awaiting redeployment.

All relevant data is held on Triages Services “MAX” system database.

The base unit with serial number YBSH011567 was finally redeployed to West Byfleet Office,
Branch Code 126023 on the 4th February 2008 and since its installation the Branch Manager
at this address has logged 29 Service Calls with the Fujitsu Services Horizon Help Desk. Once
redeployment has taken place all previous location history is overwritten on the Fujitsu
