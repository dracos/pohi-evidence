Hi Christopher,
As you may already be aware, we are in live litigation with Freeths — a firm acting on behalf a 198 claimants, who are
largely former postmasters. In order to support POL’s defence, Deloitte are performing some testing of Horizon. This

testing involves a review of transactions, hence the request for some ARQ data.

As such, could you please arrange for the attached 25 sessions to be provided by Fujitsu. I have CC’d Pete Newsome
who is aware of this.

Thanks

Mark
