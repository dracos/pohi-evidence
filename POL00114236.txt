[I[MARK/ANGELA - PLEASE UPDATE THE TEXT BELOW, WHICH WAS USED IN THE
SEPTEMBER 2019 REPORT]]

Not underestimating the potential operational, reputation and commercial implications
a negative outcome of the Horizon Issues Trial could have for the Post Office, we
engaged Deloitte (the risk advisory team which has relevant experience in crisis
preparedness and response work) to work with key business area owners to prepare an
effective immediate and short-term response to stakeholder reaction to the Judgment.
The work to date has included:

¢ defining worst-case, medium-case and best-case scenarios

¢ identifying the key stakeholders (Postmasters, Government & Regulators,
Commercial & Retail Partners and Customers)

¢ identifying potential stakeholder reaction to the trial outcome and assessing the
operational, reputational and commercial impact of those reactions

* preparing the business response to those likely impacts by identifying and impact
assessing business as usual processes; introducing new impact detection

processes (eg branch closure monitoring); designing new processeS where BAU
processes were not adequate for the worst-case scenarios; and pitting mitigation
plans in place where possible to minimise the impact.

Ultimately, the response from Day One (the day the judgm is handed down) will be
determined by what the Horizon Issues Trial Judgment {the Judgment) actually says
and how our stakeholders react to it. The output of our“work ahead of the Judgment is
the Operational Response Plan (available in the“‘reading room’) which details the
business response to stakeholder reaction to the Judgment with the ultimate aim of
continuing to maintain business operations“and provide service to our customers as
normally as possible. This is underpinned’ by a Communication Strategy and extensive
Comms collateral designed to addres$ worst, medium and best case scenarios‘. This
material has been prepared with bdsiness area owners, undergone legal review by WBD
and HSF and is currently undergoing a further ‘tone’ review by Lexington.

A Rapid Response Team (RRT) has been established to manage the stakeholder, and
execute the Post Office, response to the Judgment. The RRT will be invoked on Day One
(preparatory sessions already completed) and will run daily (until deemed no longer
required) to edordinate and manage the organisation-wide response to the Judgment,
escalating Vey decisions to the Group Executive as appropriate, collating and
distributing business impact information and providing daily update briefings.

As reported to the Board on 3 October 2019, Post Office failed to disclose all potentially r-

position. [LUPDAFE-AS-MATTERS-BEVELOP We will understand better the impact this

Third / Further Issues Trial pvude ;
The next step ahead of the “Further Issues” trial scheduled for March 2020 is for the} 3 poor

Claimants to file “Particulars of Claim” (PoC) formally setting out the legal basis for their, ial ae)
claims for financial compensation. ,

i
The Court has ordered the PoC to be filed by 25 October 2019. The Claimants may sun
however seek an extension of time so that they can reflect in the PoC the Horizo a
judgment’s findings. There is also a Case Management Conference before the Co [i

scheduled for 7 November 2019 at which any issues with the PoC could be raised’ As
matters stand however, Post Office has been ordered to file Defences formally replying
to the PoC by 25 November 2019.

As part of its ongoing review of all 551 individual cases, Post Office is identifying criteria
for selecting “Test Claimants”. These Claimants would then be used as cases
representative of the wider claimant group in an as yet unscheduled trial on breach (ite.-
whether Post Office acted wrongly), causation (i.e. did that breach cause the Claimant’s
harm), and limitation (i.e. is a Claimant’s claim time-barred). The parties will,each
propose criteria on 25 November 2019, which will then be discussed with the Managing
Judge at a Case Management Conference scheduled for 4 December 2019.

Managing messages coming out of Mediation

The Board enquired about the extent to which we could manage the messages coming
out of a settlement, and noted that BEIS input should be sought if we were considering
the use of confidentiality agreements.

° This advice will necessarily be provisional given that the Horizon judgment and the outcome of the appeal application

are not yet known.

PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT FORWARD OR SHARE

Mediation is a confidential process where the parties should be free to explore
settlement with the mediator and each other without fear of their discussions becoming
more widely known. Mediation cannot work without confidentiality.

Mediation is also a consensual process where the parties agree the terms of settlement
where one is reached. Settlement agreements can and routinely do impose
confidentiality obligations (with consequences for breach), which may be accompanied
by a statement which the parties agree can be made pyle. These terms will be subject
to negotiation along with all other s: BEIS’s input on any such terms
can therefore be si art of the information shering and segs ont process.
