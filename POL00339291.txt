Hi Alwen. I had a call about 20 minutes ago from Janet. She is setting up a meeting for 10:30 am next Weds
July 4th at Westminster. Ian and I are to attend, as maybe also is Andrew Bridgen MP. I relayed to Janet that we
have been instructed to hold back from doing major work on the matter until after that meeting. Doubtless she
will pass that on to Mr Arbuthnot and perhaps also to Mr Bridgen.

Best regards. Ron.

Best regards. Ron.

Thanks Alwen. Susan and I spoke briefly earlier this evening and we agreed that Ian and I should
hold off until we have secured Mr Arbuthnot's endorsement. We will, however, have a
conference call tomorrow with Simon Baker and Rod Ismay as we try to understand better the
Helpdesk processes in responding to incoming reports of mysterious shortages... and to
determine what data/records they retain.

Best regards. Ron.

I have spoken to Janet Walker, JA's PA and she suggested that I let her have your
telephone number and she will organise the meeting, hopefully this week, so I will pass
on your contact numbers.

If Susan suggested you start the work before meeting JA then I think that's fine, but he
will need to give his support before you officially start on the reviews.

Thanks
Alwen

Hi Alwen. Jorja and I spoke late this afternoon. I'm holding off from doing more
work on this matter until My colleague Ian Henderson and i have been approved
by Mr A. That somewhat conflicts with my instructions from Susan which was to
try to progress the matter while she is away in hols. It'd be nice if Mr A would
like a meeting this Wednesday which is the best day for me.

Very best regards. Ron.

Ron.

Good morning, I work with Susan at the Post Office and as she is on
holiday this week I am trying to organise your initial meeting with James
Atbuthnot MP, hopefully this week to enable us to go ahead and start the
reviews.

I will contact Janet Walker, James’ PA to try to see when he is available,
but if you would give me a call then we can discuss how we take it
forward.

Thanks
Alwen
