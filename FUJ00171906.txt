[fhe description of the problem is very unclear and is lacking detail. That said, having looked at the evidence supplied, I have
been able to figure out what they may be talking about.

fhe spreadsheet showing the cash declarations lists a £3712.41 cash declaration at 17:13 on 14/11/2018 with a £0.40 discrepancy
towever, a cash declaration made for the same amount the next day at 14:33 results in a -£166.46 discrepancy. This is despite
there having been no cash effecting transactions entered on the system between these two declarations.

liaving investigated further it would appear that a user has been able to transact transactions within stock unit CC in TP8 BP2
despite that stock unit having already been rolled into TP& BP3 (see attached button press timeline, rep events and session
data).

8 a result, although the transactions have been recorded in the session data table on the branch database they are not being
picked up by the rollover proce
result discrepancies are being reported in cash and stock.

s as the balance period in which they have been transacted has already been dealt with. As a

outing to development for urgent investigation/fix and guidance on reconciliation required.

rind attached an example of another branch that has been able to do transactions in a stock unit TP/BP that had already been
frolled over. Again you can see that user temporarily locked their user session on one counter, did the rollover on another
counter, then returned back to the original counter and unlocked their old user session. Transactions on this counter now in old
I'P/BP rather than new one until they logged off.

lbave Seddon @ PEAK (software team) advised the below:-

Having looked into this matter I’ve identified that a number of transactions carried out on the afternoon of 14th November have
been incorrectly allocated to TP8 BP2 rather than TP8 BP3. We’re currently investigating exactly how this happened and are
Hooking into how we can t the branch accounts. Somebody will be in touch as soon as we know more.”

[Start of Response]

le are able to reproduce the issue in development with HUID user(POID linked). The issue is highlighted as below:

h. A HUID user logs in one counter(i.e. say counter 1) and locks the current counter.
2. The user then login with same HUID user in another counter(i-e. say counter 2) and rollover to TP/BP or attaches to other SU
land cleanly logs out.

3. Now once he logs in back to the first counter his user session is not updated (i.e TP/BP/SU/etc.) as it is in a locked state
land his current session is restored without any update the user made in an earlier counter.

4. From this state if he performs any transaction it affects the state of SU/the user session.

Ithe above issue has been discussed with Jon, Andy T and Gareth. Design solution is in progress for this issue.

lover (PC0275532)

Porter, Steven

Thomas, Andrew

It2ve just been in a call with Andy T, Gareth S and Gimcy (and please feel free to comment on this email if you need to correct
lanything I say).

his is an interim note, since further design thinking is needed regarding the solution.
[this problem is related to counter A being locked, and then counter B changing some state in the database that is cached locally

lin counter A?s memory (e.g. information relating to the user or the stock unit in use on A). When counter A resumes it then has
invalid state in memory.

Pre-EUM this was avoided by various user and stock unit operations checking whether another user was logged in or attached to the
same shared stock unit, and if so preventing the operation. However these checks generally to not consider the possibility of the
same user being logged in at another counter, as that was previously not possible without invalidating the original user session.

JPost EUM, and EUM user (i.e. one associated with a POID) wrongly passes these checks and can perform the operation (e.g. rolling
lover the stock unit).

le cannot make the unlock operation update all the local state from the BRDB because the clerk may be mid-transaction, and the
requirement is to continue exactly where he left off. Therefore the only solution is to prevent the operations that may impact
the local state from happening when the user is logged in to another counter with the same Horizon user id.

[there are two possible ways to do this
h) Enhance all the existing checks to check for the same Horizon user logged in elsewhere. The problem with this is identifying
all these checks, and determining if new ones are needed.

2) Prevent access to the buttons that perform these dangerous operations if the same user is logged in but locked elsewhere
(e.g. by disabling the Back Office button, or perhaps lower level Back Office buttons).

further design thinking and analysis is needed.

I understand that POL have declined to deliver this fix, certainly not for R18.43 - thus to ensure this is not marked incorrectly
las targeted at R18.43, and I have proposed re-targeting.
