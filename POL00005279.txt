Brian,

The 3121.44 should have been cleared in branch when the rem out was done on 15.07.15. the rem that was not done for 864.75, T will
issue via late account if that makes it easier, however, I will have to wait until this office is showing as closed on our system.

Thanks

Please see email below from the field team regarding cheque adjustments at the above branch. Therefore, can you please confirm that any
adjustment can made centrally and the original cheque shortage of £3121.44 will be zeroed?

Hi Brian,

As the branch has been cleared and the loss posted to late account the £864.75 will also need to be adjusted by late account
department in Chesterfield. There is no value in returning to the branch, the current audit shortage will be reduced by this amount.

Margaret: please can you provide the cash declaration detaif to Brian from the reports you obtained on the day.

Thanks
Linda

Hi Linda

Please see email below. If someone from the field goes back to the branch to carry out this instruction below will it clear the loss found at audit and
reduce the overall shortage? I also need details of the previous night's cash declaration actual denominations versus the inflated denominations
made by!

Thanks

Brian,

by phone, we had received cheques to the value of 3121.44 between 01.07.15 and 10.07.15 that had net been remmed

These were remmed out on 15.07.15 which cleared those errors.

We are stili awaiting 864,75 to be remmed out from 13.07.15 as we have received cheques for this date. However, it looks as if the
cheque line has been cleared which must have been done by a stock adjustment so an opposite entry will need to be done in order to rem
this amount out.

Could you please arrange for this to be done.

Thanks
Judi

Hi Paul
I was wondering if you could steer this query in the right direction please. The audit report below shows the branch had a large discrepancy in
cheques, which looks like they may have been sent out of course or gone missing in the post. Therefore, could you please forward this email to the

team that deal with queries of this nature, I would also be interested in finding out what endorsements are being put on the back of cheques
accepted at the branch. This is an urgent request as the branch is closed at the moment at the Operator is suspended.

Many thanks

Brian
