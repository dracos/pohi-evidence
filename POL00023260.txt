Jane

I attach a draft updated note brining the note of 18-3-19 up to date with the Board call advice from AGQC on 20-3-19.

All comments gratefully received.

You will see that I list out the Post Office Board as attendees, but I am not sure all were on the call. Can you confirm ?
You'll also see that I don’t know the name of the Norton Rose Partner. I can finalise the note following your comments on
these points and generally.

Kind regards

Tom
