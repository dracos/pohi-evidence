Ervin,

Torstein and Gareth are struggling a little to be ready for Monday next week, so would suggest we aim to
defer by one week.

I will be away next week so would ask you to confirm directly with Torstein assuming that we have agreed the
commercial terms.

Regards,

Mike

Thanks Peter.

I'm conscious that we currently have a target start date for next Monday, so hoping we can sort out
commercials before or on the day.

Happy to consider using an LOE, can you please let me have an example of a
previous Fujitsu version so I can check the T&C's

Mike,

Thank you for arranging the call today to agree a way forward.

Agreed next steps from the call:

1. Torstein to progress with Gareth the prep and collation of key documentation &
artefacts to support kick-off and planning meeting on the 13" Feb with KPMG.

2. Proceed with the objectives/scope/deliverables per phase 0 ( as proposed in the
preface of the current proposal).

3. Outline the incremental costs to test ‘x’ number of controls — we will provide
tiers for indicative budgetary, and also a cost per control tested.

4. Target start date 13" Feb 2012.
FUJ00172064
FUJ00172064

5. All the above (1-3) to be written into an SoW, under an existing framework
agreement between Fujitsu & KPMG.

6. Ervin and Peter to check existence of MSA/Framework Agreements
UPDATE on Action point 6:

Peter,

I've checked with the lead external audit partner and there is no MSA agreement in

place, other than the contract for External Audit services. However KPMG has and is
performing non-audit and advisory services to Fujitsu, and these are provisioned

under separate Letters of Engagement signed by the Fujitsu business sponsor, to

which a PO is raised against. These LoE’s have pre-agreed terms of business (T&C's)
between KPMG & Fujitsu which govern such engagements.

Are you happy to proceed on this same basis in the absence of an MSA/Framework?
Regards,

Ervin
