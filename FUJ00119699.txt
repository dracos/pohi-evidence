1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to identify Post Office Network’s policies
covering Contractual Authorities Responsibility 532.000.003.

It demonstrates at high level how we will ensure staff are released for all
necessary training events. The detail of how this will happen is covered in
other documents referred to at 0.3 Associated Documents.

2. Scope

The scope of this document is limited to describing the deliverables at a high
level associated with the release of individuals to attend training and covers
the following areas:-

« the process adopted by Post Office Network to release the appropriate
individuals for training.

« the process for escalation within Post Office Network when individuals
fail to attend training within the ten day window

e the process in which Post Office Network will pro-actively inform and
encourage users to attend and training events. It will also explain their
contractual obligations to attend training.

* contingency procedures within territories

* the process of how territories are informed of this Contractual Authorities
Responsibility and how CCM’s are notifying RNM’s, NBSC and territory
staff of it’s significance to the success of the Horizon rollout.

3. Duration Of Specific Courses

Horizon training courses have been developed to meet the varying needs of
the 72,000 people identified as requiring some form of Horizon training.

Each specific course has been developed by ICL Pathway, KnowledgePool
and the Horizon User Implementation team, with input from the relevant
areas of expertise within Post Office Network. A Training Needs Analysis
document was baselined and this documents all the various courses module
by module. The document also details the respective number of people who
will attend the different types of courses and over what period of time, below
is an outline of the type of course each job role will undertake and the
duration of the course :-

4. Post Office Network Approach To Releasing Individuals To Attend
Training

Post Office Network will ensure all staff, agents, registered assistants and
reliefs are released for training. The release of staff will comply to Post Office
Network requirement 915 where all staff will be made available for training.
(see BP/PRD/013 and IM/CLOS/001 for more detail). An outline of the
processes in place to support attendance at training and awareness events are
shown below :-

© Post Office Network via the CCM, RNM or NBSC will contact either by
phone or in person any individual refusing to attend training

© Post Office Network where necessary will allow for an outlet to close to
attend training

« Post Office Network will make a one off payment to subpostmasters for
their attendance at training (including awareness events)

© Post Office Network will deem any subpostmaster refusing to attend
training, to have failed to meet their contractual obligations and therefore
they are unable to run a post office

* subpostmasters will be asked to sign a statement, explaining the
consequences of their refusal to attend training

* subpostmasters have been made aware that it is their responsibility to
release all their staff to attend training and that should any fail to do so

they will not be allowed to use the Horizon system until they have had
local training given by the subpostmaster

© if asubpostmaster’s member of staff fails to attend training they will be
prevented from any further employment in Post Office Network.

All individuals (except Post Office Network trainers and specialists ) receive
their joining instructions one month in advance of their proposed training
date. Post Office Network requires a 20 week lead in time for trainers and
specialists as their work is scheduled this far in advance, joining instructions
are sent out at week 16. (Please note: there are no specialist training courses
available, allocation has been depleted).

4.1 Process

There will be a formal request to attend training from ICL Pathway which is
the beginning of the training process (see IMP/REQ/014). The identification
of those individuals who require training will be obtained via the training
requirement questionnaire completed at the time of the UAE by the outlet
manager.

Training will be offered within a 10 day window prior to installation. Each
outlet manager will be given specific dates for training and installation and
will only be allowed to refuse those specific dates in exceptional
circumstances. (see CCN721)

Terminal illness Yes reschedule outlet, discuss
including direct alternative methods of training
family

Bereavement Yes offer a backfill place, or reschedule

outlet and discuss alternate
method of training

Robbery Yes reschedule outlet, and offer
backfill place.

Hospital Yes arrange a DRI, if not possible offer

Seasonal — N/A needs to be managed outside of

the process
Resigned/outlet Yes if no definite date then date must
transfer be accepted - if definite date

preferred install then train and
migrate at a later date , but
depends very much on
circumstances

Arrangements to ensure individuals attend within this 10 day window will be
the responsibility of the line manager or agent. Any issues which need
resolving will be escalated via their line managers (BP/PRD/013 refers).

Post Office Network HFSO, trainers, auditors, security, investigation and
other specialist staff training requirements will vary in length and the release
of these individuals will be agreed with the respective Heads of Sections.
(BP/PRD/013 refers).

4.2 Refusal To Attend

ICL Pathway will notify the respective CCM of any individuals who refuses
to attend training via electronic mail within 24 hours. The CCM will notify
the RNM or NBSC (for those outlets whose RNM is part of the Retail Line
Review Pilot) by phone or electronic mail within 24 hours if they are unable to
resolve the issue. The RNM/NBSC will contact/ visit the outlet to explain the
position, further refusal will be escalated to the Head Of Retail Network to
make the decision on the way forward. (BP/PRD/013 refers). Post Office
Network have produced general guidelines to be communicated to the
territories on how to deal with individuals refusing to attend and timescales
to react to problems. (See Appendix B)

4.3 Non Attendance On Day Of Training

The KnowledgePool trainer will phone TAC who will let the respective CCM
know via email within 24 hours of occurrence. The daily No Show report
provides details of the individual who has not turned up. (cross reference
SU/REP/021). The CCM will ascertain the reasons and offer an available
backfill place. (See Appendix C)

4.4 Late Attendance The Day Of Training
The courses which have been developed, run on a modular basis working to a

very tight timescales allowing very little time to be able to go over ground
again.

The latest a delegate can enter a course is 9.30 a.m. or before the start of the
Logging On module which covers passwords and security issues. At trainer
discretion a delegate may be admitted to the course after 9.30 a.m.

The delegate will be placed on the No Show report via the KnowledgePool
trainer and TAC. The CCM will ascertains the reasons and then offer an
available backfill place. The delegate may have to travel more than the agreed
25 miles.

4.5 Roles of Contract Control Manager/Retail Network Manager/Network
Business Support Centre To Gain Commitment To Attend Training

The Horizon programme is one of Post Office Network’s top objective and
will form part of the CCM/RNM/NBSC objectives. Different approaches will
be made to ensure individuals attend:

telephone calls to outlets encouraging attendance
visits to outlets

Counter New articles

individual letters to outlets

eee

Processes will be adopted to optimise the number of individuals attending the
MIB and UAE events. RNM/NBSC will contact known individuals who
refuse to attend training (BP/PRD/013 refers).

4.6 Release Rates For staff From Outlets To Attend Training

To assist in the maximisation of release rates:

¢ KnowledgePool TAC will schedule courses in the area where the activity
(migration) is taking place rather than on the edge of the 25 mile distance
limits

© Release rates to be on the scale of 50% for 2 staff, 33% for 3, 50% for 4 and
25% for above. It may be necessary to be even more flexible over ECCO
outlets, as there are fewer Postal Officers courses to be run than Counter
Assistant.

¢ Individual outlet requirements to be taken into account with
acknowledgement of end of month pressure, number of part time staff and
Bank Holidays.

¢ Scheduling all courses (Counter Manager/Counter Assistant/Postal
Officers) by KnowledgePool at the same time to highlight the release rates
for individual outlets at the earliest opportunity.

mandatory attendance at training (BP/PRD/013 refers). A separate
communications paper has been produced outlining Post Office Network
policy for territories to distribute to all outlets. Below is an outline of some of
the key communication activities which have taken place :-

« Letter to branch secretaries explaining commitment required of its
membership.

¢ Letter to all outlets re enforcing branch secretaries message

« Communication pack for each outlet explaining their role in the
Infrastructure and Implementation Cycles.

6.2 Method

When the need for training is identified, the appropriate Post Office Network
trainer will access the territorial database to ascertain if the outlet is Horizon
installed. The appropriate training will then be planned.

6.3 Training For Subpostmasters

The following sections contain overviews of the actions to be taken under
each heading. (Full details can be found in BP/PRD/013 and IM/SST/002).

6.3.1 Subpostmaster Resigns

Under normal circumstances Post Office Network will be given 3 months
notice that a subpostmaster wishes to resign. There will be exceptions to this,
but the process as currently in place for manual outlet resignations, is flexible
enough to deal with all eventualities.

Upon receipt of notification of resignation the training section in the territory
will book an accredited Horizon trainer to attend the outlet at the day of
transfer which is normally a Wednesday.

Following notification of a resignation, it is the responsibility of the Post

Office Network trainer to ensure all the necessary documentation, training
materials etc. are in place ready for the subsequent transfer and training to
the incoming subpostmaster. An overview of the process is shown below :-

* Subpostmaster sends in a letter of resignation to the Territorial Agency

Recruitment section

The vacancy is advertised

Business Plans are submitted to Finance from applicants

Interviews are arranged for short listed applicants

Appointment is made by RNM

Agency Recruitment confirm take over date with training team

¢ Post Office Network trainer is allocated and puts together a transfer pack

« Pre Induction training is given two days prior to outlet transfer in
classroom environment

* Outlet transfer takes place (normally p.m. Wednesday)

© Post Office Network trainer commences 2 week on site training

« Up to3 supported balances are given by Post Office Network trainer

eeee

6.3.2 Delivery Of Training

All of the training for new subpostmasters will be given by Horizon
accredited Post Office Network trainers who have undergone the Horizon
Train The Trainer course.

Delivery of training will be by Post Office Network trainers, on-site, and in
between customers. Where new assistants join at the same time as the new
subpostmaster, they will also be given on site training by Post Office Network
trainers.

Training on site will start after the subpostmaster has undertaken their two
day induction course. The induction course is used to enable the
subpostmaster to have some insight into how the counter operates.

The induction course will use the Horizon platform and the 1.5 day managers
course used during roll out will form the nucleus of the two days training.
The top ten transactions of the outlet due to be transferred will also be
demonstrated to the incoming subpostmaster using Horizon. The course also
covers Post Office Network Customer First principles, Customer Care
training, Counter Operations Manuals and the Horizon System User Guide.

Date: 22/11/00

The outlet is usually transferred on the Wednesday p.m. supported by the
auditors and trainers. The live training starts the day after transfer.

6.3.3 Commencement Of On Site Training

The trainer will sit behind the subpostmaster observing how they are
processing each transaction and assisting where necessary. At quiet times
they will, encourage the subpostmaster to switch to training mode to
consolidate what they have learnt in the induction course and to process
transactions they have yet to come across, using the training material
provided by ICL Pathway.

In all, training on site, fully supported by an Horizon accredited trainer, will
last for two weeks, plus support for up to three balances or more if required.
All on site customer facing transactions are conducted using the Horizon
system therefore giving them not only the 1.5 day Horizon Counter Managers
course given to subpostmasters during roll out, but a further supported two
weeks of training.

6.3.4 Appointment Of New Subpostmasters Assistant

Post Office Network policy is that the subpostmaster will train new assistants
on site, and they will be supported by Post Office Network training material.
This process is fully described in “Steady State policy document”. The
subpostmaster will also have to sign a certificate stating that they have
trained any new staff to an acceptable standard using the Horizon System
Training Mode Function.

6.3.5 Relief Subpostmasters/Holiday Substitutes

The training of relief subpostmasters or holiday substitutes will be carried out
by ICL Pathway as part of the outlets normal Horizon training requirements.
The subpostmaster should add their names to the Horizon training
questionnaire to include them with their own staff. All new
relief’s/substitutes coming on stream after roll out is finished, are to be
trained by the first subpostmaster they cover.

6.3.6 New Retail Network Managers Or Specialists

Turnover training for the above will be carried out by Post Office Network
trainers where possible using the Horizon equipment installed in each of the
territory. The scheduling and timing of the training will be agreed between
the individual and the training team.

This will be delivered by Post Office Network trainers on site or ina
classroom as currently performed, at the discretion of the local Post Office
Network Territory Training Manager.

6.3.7 Trainer Training

Territorial training staff require their courses 20 weeks ahead of the course
date. Six staff are allocated to each course. The HR Training Co-ordinator
(Salford) supplies the names and courses required to ICL Pathway in week
19. They will be invited at week 16 to the respective courses and inform the
HR Training Co-ordinator of the course details. The HR Training Co-
ordinator will be responsible for ensuring their staff are released
(BP/PRD/013 refers). Please note: There are no more Horizon Train The
Trainer courses available.

7. Steady State Training

Post Office Network have taken a decision to use their own training material
for all releases. ICL Pathway own the copyright for all training material

It will still be ICL Pathway’s responsibility to update Post Office Network’s
accredited trainers via the Horizon Implementation team who in turn will
update their own training materials.

8. Reporting

The detailed process for reporting has been outlined in ICL Pathway’s
document SU/REP/021 Standard Reports And Formats for release of staff
during roll out.

Appendix A Responses To Key Issues

1. If a subpostmaster refuses to have Horizon installed in his outlet despite all
reasonable attempts to persuade him, he will have effectively ceased his
contract since it is Post Office Network and NFSP stated policy to install
Horizon across the whole network. **

2. In the event of a subpostmaster failing to attend their scheduled ICL
Pathway training, or failure of their staff to attend, they will be given the
opportunity to state his case to their CCM/RNM/NBSC.

3. The requirement to be trained is a precondition to operating the system.
This applies to relief subpostmasters as much as permanent
subpostmasters. As far as possible they will be given an opportunity to
attend one of the scheduled training courses in their area of operation but
this will depend on their being recognised as a relief through the
registration process. Post Office Network believes that full time reliefs i.e.
those whose main source of employment is in post offices, should be
required to make a contribution to their training course.

4. Subpostmasters and their staff will be trained to meet the requirements of
the system and will be provided with a certificate of achievement. This will
be a valuable recognition of knowledge of the system and a safeguard of
employment capability in the Post Office Network.

The standards of competency are not onerous and Post Office Network
expects all trained users to easily meet them. In the unlikely event that
individuals do not meet the appropriate standards first time, additional
training and coaching will be provided to support another and even a
subsequent assessment. In order to operate a post office, all staff and
agents, and their staff have to be competent in using the system.

5. The subpostmaster is expected to respond flexibly and punctually to all
requests to set dates for training activity at their outlet.

6. Experience to date indicates there will be a small proportion of outlets
which are not capable of being altered to accept the standard equipment. In
such cases Post Office Network would work with the subpostmaster to
ensure services are maintained, including consideration of whether a
different location for the subpostmaster may be feasible.

** A requirement of this process is that Retail Network Managers, and the
Retail Line Managers are informed of a clear message to give to
subpostmasters who do not attend training or refuse training e.g. formal

written notification of consequence of action - problems/costs etc. and

their contract for service with Post Office Network.
