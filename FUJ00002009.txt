1.0 Service Summary

44 Fujitsu Services will provide a Communications Management Team (CMT), co located
within the Service Desk (SD) which delivers a value add function above and beyond the
standard incident and problem management service provided by Fujitsu Services.

1.2 The SD provides a first level support, including end to end Incident management to
Branches and other designated groups, as defined in the Working Document entitled: “SD
Joint Working Document” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0010), through the provision of a Service
Desk and incident management function.

1.3. The CMT service complements the SD. It is an additional service provided that
comprises activities above and beyond those accounted for by the SD and the incident and
problem management processes already in place.

2.0 CMT

2.1 Service Definition

2.1.1 Incident Management

2.1.1.1. The CMT is a purely pro-active function and is responsible for providing an end-to-end
management to resolution of all network related incidents which render the service
unavailable within the Branch. The CMT consistently monitors the communications
status of the Branch estate and attempts to resolve issues prior to the Branch becoming
aware there is a problem.

2.1.1.2. The CMT provides an enhanced level of value add activity to maximise the speed at
which network related incidents are resolved and the service restored to the Branch.
As part of this approach, both Post Office and the Branch are informed at regular
intervals as to the status of the incident. The approach includes but is not limited to:

« Liaising with internal Fujitsu Services delivery units in resolving network related
incidents arising within the Fujitsu Services Central Infrastructure

« Liaising with external Fujitsu Services network suppliers in resolving network
related incidents arising within the Fujitsu Services Branch Infrastructure

« The monitoring and management of designated problem Branches by providing
regular support and guidance during network related incidents

« The monitoring of repeat incidents occurring at Branches and elevating persistent
incidents to problem status and if necessary, elevating the Branch to problem
Branch status

* Providing regular contact (outgoing calls with Branches) as to the status of the
incident resolution where incidents remain open and where either the SLT or the
Postmaster’s agreed time for resolution is likely to be compromised

Service Description 1.0
FUJITSU SERVICES

Commercial in Confidence 09/06/06

« Giving assistance to Branches in resolving incidents where this can be provided
remotely for “non standard” faults, i.e. environmental issues and other non-
technology related factors that impair or affect the service

« Liaison with Branches re changing “Access Times” and communicating these
changes to the telecommunications providers to ensure support engineer
attendance at an agreed convenient time for the Branch.

« The pro-active investigation and managing to resolution those network issues
identified via the Non Polling process whereby Branches are reported as having
not delivered transaction data to Post Office or its clients. Non polling may be due
to a number of reasons, not specifically related to a communications issue, e.g. a
counter switched off or a hardware fault currently being resolved. Fujitsu Services
is bound by the Data Delivery Service Level Targets, as described in the document
entitled “Data Centre Operations Service, Service Description”
(SVM/SDM/SD/0003), which underpins the delivery of these transactions.
However, if there is a specific issue within the Branch, a call will be raised via the
HSD by the CMT and will be investigated and managed as per the usual incident
management process described within the document entitled: “POA Incident
Management Process Details” (CS/PRD/074). Through the pro active resolution
of non polling incidents, the CMT will ensure that issues are logged prior to the
Branch becoming aware of any fault and in cases where this is not feasible, will
work with the Branch to resolve the incident, for example by ascertaining the
operational status of all counters within the Branch, even if there is no evidence of
a specific communications issue. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation set out
in this bullet do not in any way absolve Fujitsu Services in its responsibilities to
ensure data delivery by Day J, until the migration of Branches to the HNG-X
application which would be achieved by alternative processes.

« The management of communications issues with BT in respect of PSTN faults. A
significant part if the activity carried out by the CMT is the regular liaison with BT
in respect of communications faults within the ADSL service. In assessing the
incident to facilitate a resolution, the team does not draw a distinction as to
whether the failure is within the PSTN line, which is owned by Post Office or the
ADSL service provided by Fujitsu Services. The priority is assessment and
resolution of the incident. Subject to Post Office delivering to it’s obligations as
defined within section 2.8. of this Communications Management Team Service
Description to ensure there is clarification of any potential conflict between BT
working procedures and OFCOM definition of responsibilities, Fujitsu Services
will ensure that, incidents within the PSTN domain, e.g. filters, problems with the
PSTN line etc, will be managed by Fujitsu Services thereby reducing the resource
required within the appropriate Post Office team and avoiding the risk of delay in

assessment and resolution of the incident, which would result in the Branch being
unable to trade for an extended period of time.

2.1.2 Service Management

2.1.2.1 Pro-Active Incident Reduction

To ensure the Branch and Counter Position availability is kept to a maximum and within the
Branch and Counter Availability Service Level Targets (SLT), which have been agreed at a
level commensurate with the provision of the CMT, as detailed in the CCD entitled: “Branch
Network Service, Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0011), the CMT will work closely
with the Systems Management Service. Where an event or a system or network incident has
been identified, the Systems Management Service will raise an appropriate incident, (this may
be in advance of any incident raised by the Branch), via the SD at the required severity /
priority level to enable the issue to be resolved in accordance with the document entitled:
“POA Customer Service Incident Management Process Details” (CS/PRD/074).

2.1.2.2 Continuous Service Improvement

The CMT will work closely with the Fujitsu Services Service Management Team and Post
Office on an on going basis to identify and implement, where agreed with Post Office, service
or cost improvement initiatives with the service.

2.1.2.3 Service Reporting

The CMT will input into the content of the daily incident report provided by Fujitsu Services
to Post Office which identifies all Branches with open incidents and the status to resolution of
those incidents. This daily report enables Fujitsu Services and Post Office to track and monitor
the progress of incidents and escalate any specific problems to minimise the amount of time
the Branch can not trade.

The CMT will, as required, provide input into service reporting for distribution to Post Office
as required under the Service Management Service described in the CCD entitled: “Service
Management Service, Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0007).

2.2 Service Availability

The CMT Service is available from 08:00hrs to 18:30hrs Monday to Saturday excluding
Christmas Day.
