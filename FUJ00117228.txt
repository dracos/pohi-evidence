Due Date

Jan-01

GP to provide detail behind this statement “G4S TUPE:
Originally 80 people in scope, now only 9 through our challenge
of the Getronics in scope list. Remaining 9 all have roles
identified in Fujitsu posttransfer”

Update 25/01/12 Maz Kostuch - in summary the 80 was at
best a punt from Getronics on the staff involved with the
G4S estate. The 9 heads we are looking at are all fulltime
and key resources which we and G4S have agreed are the
right names. If your concern was are we getting the right
resources to support the solution then infrastructure wise
much of what we now operate is newly built so we have the
skills and knowledge. In the network space we have
secured within the 9 heads specifically one guy who has
been key to helping us resolve many of the integration
issues. Applications support is with G4S so these skills and
responsibility reside with them.

Identify where in solution design and costing in bids the costs for
securtiy were missed in both G4S and Centrica.

Update 30/11: email from M Kostuch - in both cases the
original solution was to manage alerts via a manual log. The
security team have now advised that they need to use a tool
to trap and manage the alerts which has created additional
cost in terms of licences and implementation.

We need to ensure we have a standard methodology, toolset
and processes for our project and programme management.
This must not get lost as we start to split the P&PM community
across multiple service lines/ring fenced accounts. Needs to be
built into the workstream plan.

Update: 15/11: A review with PSD and GBD was held 15th
November where what is currently available was shared and
actions agreed as part of the continual road to improve
what we will mandate in the future.

Update 24/10: Email from P Jeram - we do have standard
methodology, we need to ensure it is more visible, simple to
find and follow, and mandated through the service lines.
Community ownership definition is part of the transition
and needed to be defined/agreed. We will arrange a review
with the GBD/PSD PM owners Rob and Maz, to share what
exists and take input on where usage can be simplified.
Update 24/10: Email from S Clayton — Finance staff are
being asked to perform support tasks that should be
performed by the PM Community. I am recruiting a Head of
Project and Contract Accounting this quarter to set up the
new Centre of Excellence. I suggest Chris B, Pete J, Maz K
work with Rob and Amanda to agree scope and seta
standard financial management approach for all UK&l progs
and projects.

Identify what is happening with the next wave of RBS VCS
programme.

Update 29/06: Low business follow through on planned
deployments is impacting roll-out. Business engagement team
is being strengthened to focus on building more robust rol-out
plans with completion of all user vetting before inclusion in plan.
Status 8/7: Total migrations to date are approximately 2,000.
A commitment has been given to Tony Stennett and Mike
Errington that a further 4,000 will be migrated in July and
9,500 in August. Plans have been developed and agreed
with the Bank to change the approach to migrations, this
will begin to show an impact from next week.

A separate workstream has been established to address
and engage on commercial issues a ToR has been
established for this. Fujitsu is putting forward a robust
defence of its commercial position and will be challenging
the bank regarding obligations and dependencies it has
failed to deliver that contribute to the disappointing
migrations numbers.

Additional check points have been set up to review number
of migrations and commercial position - 3 times weekly.
