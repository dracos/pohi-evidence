CEO’s Report

jor: Paula Vennells Date: January 2016

Executive Summary

Context

Our scorecard metrics for 2015/16 are: Our 3 year goals are:
1. Net Income - £875m 1. To establish the foundations of a
2. EBITDAS - (£35m) successful independent business.
3. Digital Net Income - £21.5m 2. To accelerate the transformation of
4. Customer Effort - 64% Post Office and reach breakeven.
5. NPS FS only - 25 3. To secure commercial sustainability
6. Engagement - 63% for the long term.
7. NT branches transformed - 1850
8. Crown P&L - (£4.9m)

In summary, our strategy to achieve our goals is to stabilise our income in mails and
grow in financial services by focusing on the customer, moving up the value chain
where suitable; modernise our physical and digital channels; streamline our support
services; build a simpler, more cost effective operating model; alongside improving
our colleague and network engagement.

Questions this paper addresses

1. What is on my mind? (successes, challenges, opportunities and risks)
2. What are the implications for our outlook and plans?

Conclusion

3. Financial performance through the P9 peak period is encouraging with EBITDAS
and income favourable to forecast. Provided momentum is maintained through
Q4 we are well placed to deliver our targets.

4. Our transformation continues. As set out in the transformation report, some
slippage (notably in End User Computing) is putting their benefits delivery profile
at risk, with the potential to create additional pressure on next year’s budget.

5. In addition, some of our change activities are generating industrial relations
challenges that require careful management.

Input Sought

The Board is invited to note the report and highlight any issues where a future
discussion would be welcome.

The Report

Looking Back
WHAT HAS GONE WELL?

¢ Financial Performance - P9
— EBITDAS for month 9 was £(0.5)m - £0.5m favourable to Q2 forecast.
— Net income in the month of £81.6m was £0.7m favourable to Q2 forecast.
— This was driven by a strong mails performance through the peak trading
period; and continued improvements in financial services, notably in life and
home insurance, credit card and banking and payments.
¢ Customer Service
— Our focus on maintaining customer through the peak helped ensure that
targets were achieved on Effort (65% vs 62% target) and NPS (+61 vs +55
target)
— Wait time and Customer Satisfaction fell just below target (69% vs 71%
target; and 85% vs 86% target respectively)
Strongest performance came from Crown, with all four targets achieved.
YTD performance remains ahead of target on all measures

td

WHAT HAS NOT GONE WELL?

¢ Financial Performance — P9

— Despite improvements in financial services as a whole, performance in
mortgages and savings continues to be significantly below target. We will be
monitoring the impact of re-pricing through P10.

¢ Industrial Relations

— As expected, there was industrial action by the CWU on Christmas Eve:

o 48% of staff who could have gone on strike chose to do so (lower than in
previous action)

o 83% of Crown Offices stayed open

o All staff in Leeds supply chain went on strike.

o 9 out of 11 staff in our St Helens call centre went on strike.

— Contingency plans meant at there was no impact on customers from the
action in Leeds and St Helens. This is a credit to the leadership of those
teams.

— There was a further strike in Leeds Supply Chain on 4° January and
separately, a vote in favour of action in our Dearne call centre.

e Flooding

— Unfortunately, 144 Post Offices were affected by the recent flooding.
However, the majority of which have been dealt with locally and are now re-
opened.

— 5 remain closed but are expected to reopen within the next week.

— We will be conducting a review of our response to ensure we respond as

OPPORTUNITIES?

IRRELEVANT

© SGET Consiiltation

— Subject to internal Government clearance, BIS are proposing to publish their
consultation paper on our SGEI later this month or early next month.

— We have been working closely with the Shareholder Executive in formulating
the paper and the draft is completely aligned with the policy position we
discussed in October.

— In particular, it reaffirms Government’s commitment to maintaining the
current network size and access criteria (with the possible exception of some
flexibility around the postcode criterion). It also discusses the need to move
to more cost effective operating models and locations in the rural /
unconverted network.

— BIS propose to publish the final report from London Economics / You Gov on
the social value of the network alongside the consultation document. It
confirms a headline valuation range of £4.3bn - £9.7bn pa, which is broadly in
line with the range identified in the 2009 Nera study (although that had a
lower bound of £2bn).

¢ Communications and Engagement

— Weare getting our top 300 managers together in a new leadership and
communications forum.

— The aim is to drive leadership behaviour, empower and inspire colleagues and
generate passion about the detail of delivering our transformation.

— Our success will depend on these leaders engaging their teams regularly in
both the opportunities and hard realities of change.

— The first event takes place on January 26th

RISKS OR CONCERNS?
e Budget
— We are in the process of working up budgets for the next financial year, with
a clear focus on driving down costs to close the gap between current plans
and where we need to be to achieve our targets, and potentially break even in
2016/17. Al will provide a further update in the meeting.

e Interim Report

— The Board approved the interim report for the six months ended 30
September 2015, subject to finalising the provisions for the compensation of
Subpostmasters (SPMs) under Network Transformation.

— The arrangements with SPMs are complex and change over time. As a result,
recalculating the provisions at specific dates has been extremely complex,
hampered by multiple, manual data sources. The work has been completed
and the provision has been increased by £67m in the comparative balance
sheet at September 2014 and £87m at March 2015. EY has audited the
changes.

— Adetailed paper, setting out the causes, rectification and lessons learnt has
been circulated to the ARC. The work has enabled us to confirm that there
has been no impact on payments to SPMs, cash or bonuses: it is a timing
difference in recognition of a future liability. The team is confident that there
is no impact on the total forecast cost of the programme and is completing
final checks in the next few days.

— As discussed, the error is disclosed in the Business Review section of the
Interim report as follows:

An error was identified in the calculation of the provision for future payments
of postmasters’ compensation within the Network Transformation programme
on the balance sheet and exceptional items charged in the 2014-15 half year
and full year. The March 2015 exceptional charge has been restated by £87
million of which £67 million was restated into the September 2014 exceptional
charge. This was a timing error related to recognition of the liability. It has
not impacted payments to postmasters or the overall cost of the programme.

— In addition, the change will be noted in the 2014-15 accounts of our holding
company.

— A detailed set of reactive questions-and-answers are being prepared. The final
Interim report will be circulated early next week with a view to signing on
22nd and publishing in the following week.

¢ Industrial Relations

— Our most significant change activities (as outlined at September’s Board
meeting) are all now underway and on schedule. For example:
© consultation on closing the defined benefit pension scheme to future

accrual starts on 2™4 February;
© colleagues in Crown branches that may be affected by our franchising
plans are being briefed about the potential changes on 19" January; and
o we are developing our mandates and negotiating position for the
impending pay negotiations for all managers and Crown CWU grades
respectively.

— We will also be discussing the latest position on Supply Chain later in this
Board meeting.

— As indicated above, each of these presents challenges for our industrial
relations. The challenge is made greater by the CWU ignoring important
aspects of our agreed Collective Engagement & Industrial Relations

POL00030953
POL00030953

PAGE 5 OF 5

Framework, notably the Dispute Resolution Procedure designed to avoid a

default to industrial action.

— Ihave written to the General Secretary making it clear that the CWU’s actions
are making the agreement unworkable. A meeting is being scheduled with
the aim of securing a commitment to respect the agreement so it works as

intended.
¢ NFSP Relations

— Tensions arose at the beginning of December as a result of the presentation
of the NFSP Annual Plan (required to enable the annual grant payments) and
subsequent reluctance to agree to the suggested additional requirements.

— This resulted in NFSP threatening to withdraw from the Grant Agreement
unless POL meets their demands of concessions on the agreement
(membership levels, VAT) and various business initiatives (ATM fee reduction,
cost recovery for conformance training). They also requested a £20m (£10m
this year, £10m next) “stabilisation” payment to postmasters.

— We have sought to resolve this in a cooperative manner in order to maintain
our preferred position of a collaborative relationship with NFSP.

— We have been clear that we will not be making a payment of £20m but
indicated our willingness to discuss the NFSP’s other concerns. The offer of
further discussions has been received positively with the next meeting

scheduled for 14" January.

In Conclusion

Following good performance through P9,
I remain confident that we will deliver
our targets this year. I also am confident
that we will deliver our transformation
programme. However, slippage in some
programmes is putting the delivery
profile of benefits at risk, with the
potential to create additional pressure on
next year’s budget.

Strictly Confidential

The process for setting the budget for
2016/17 will be challenging and require
some difficult choices. This is underway
and there is an opportunity to discuss at
this month's Board.

Similarly, we need to manage a
challenging industrial relations
environment, being clear on the rationale
for change.

Transformation Update

jor: Michael Brown Sponsor: David Hussey Date: 13/01/2016

Executive Summary

Context

The Post Office is undertaking a complex transformation programme, designed to
modernise our network and IT infrastructure, streamline our cost base and create the
platform for customer-led growth. The core objective is to create a commercially
sustainable business equipped to cope with lower levels of government funding after
March 2018.

Questions this paper addresses

1. Overall, are we on track to deliver our key Transformation programmes?
2. What are the implications of any variance, for our outlook and plans?

Conclusion

1. Reasonable progress has been made delivering some major milestones across the
Transformation programmes. These include: completing 5,000 modernised
branches under Network Transformation; delivering, or on track to deliver, £53.9m
of in-year cost savings against a target of £45.7m; the new Banking Framework
with banking partners operationally live; and publishing the detailed integrated
plan.

2. However, slippage in the IBM plan for the Branch Technology Transformation
Programme has used some of the programme’s contingency, though the overall
end date is not currently impacted. End User Computing (Admin) and Post Office
Card Account plans have also experienced milestone slippage, with risks across
other programmes.

3. Delays to Branch Technology Transformation and Post Office Card Account
programmes are putting their benefits delivery profile at risk. The impact of
revised benefit profile is being reviewed as part of the three year planning process,
with an updated position to be presented to the Board in March.

Trinity investigations are progressing and a separate update on the latest position
will be provided at the January Board.

Input Sought

The Board are asked to note the progress made, key challenges faced and actions
taken to address them.

WHAT HAS GONE WELL (SINCE LAST PROGRESS REPORT IN OCTOBER)?

e Network Transformation

o In November the milestone to modernise 5,000 branches (with 5,114
modernised by the end of 2015) was achieved.

o This provides 152,000 additional opening hours per week across the 5000
modernised branches - the equivalent of 3,300 extra Post Office branches
helping us become better for customers by being there when they need
us.

o It will also help us greatly reduce our reliance on public funds as we
remove fixed remuneration to agents.

o In order to mitigate further slippage we are holding detailed requirements
and design workshops with suppliers, to ensure we adopt the best
approach.

o The programme team are finalising the integration of IT partners’ (IBM

In Conclusion

The biggest risk to delivery is replacing
the Horizon branch software with the IBM
solution (Front Office). Supplier dates are
slipping, putting the whole plan under
increased pressure.

EUC admin plans are tight and the
environment inherited from RMG is
complex. Whilst there is milestone
movement, the end date is currently
protected.

Strictly Confidential

The risks within the current Front Office
plan could result in increased costs and
delayed benefits; and an erosion of
timeline contingency.

The potential options to reduce
complexity, risk and cost are progressing
under Project Trinity (separate update to
the Board)

If we miss 31° March deadline, we incur
further penalties from RMG.

The programme is being closely
controlled and reviewed regularly jointly
by the CFO and Transformation Director.

ALL PROGRAMMES AGGREGATED I

Delivery:- Whilst there has been milestone slippage within the baselined plan across
some programmes, the red status is primarily driven by delays to:

Branch Technology Transformation Programme - IBM plan and the Common Digital
Platform migration dates are slipping.

PO Card Account - Uncertainty around the Hewlett Packard timeline for selecting their new
Banking Partner and the consequential impact on the procurement time lines.

End User Computing Admin - Extensions to pilots and testing, whilst protecting the end
date.

Next steps:

Branch Technology Transformation - undertaking deep dives with external suppliers (IBM,
ATOS and Fujitsu) to interrogate/challenge plans and minimise impact of slippage.

PO Card Account - working with bidders and their respective Banks, draft revisions to the
supplier agreement before issuing the final tender documents on 8" February 2016.

End User Computing - CFO and Transformation Director monitoring closely to ensure
delivery to plan. Daily reporting dashboard will be implemented from commencement of
roll out.

Plan reviews in the Transformation Delivery Group are being undertaken with programmes
to address root cause of milestone movement.

Cost:- 2015-16 full year investment costs is forecast to underspend by £34M, (excluding
provisions for postmasters’ compensation) c.£20m of which will flow into next financial
year. Costs across the three year plan are under review as part of the three year planning
Process, current submissions are c. £70m above the assumptions in three year plan.
Next steps:- Close management of 2015-16 year end position and completion of three
year planning. Complete prioritisation exercise to bring 2016-17 investment spend back in
line and create contingency.

Benefits:- In year benefits are Green with the longer-term forecast Amber. Cost
Reduction Group is reporting £53.9m of delivered or on track initiatives for 2015-16
against a target of £45.7M. Benefits from Network Transformation are on track. The
majority of other Transformation benefits are due in subsequent years, and some are
under threat of being delayed or reduced as a result of risks impacting delivery and
updated assumptions across programmes.

Next steps:- Undertake benefit reviews with each programme during Q4. The impact of
revised benefit profile will be reviewed as part of new three year plan process, with an
updated position to be presented to the Board in March.

Risks: Risks across the whole portfolio remain significant. Over the last six months the
total qualitative risk exposure has slightly reduced. However the profile of high impact
and probability risks has slightly increased, due to both the financial (cost and benefits)
and industrial relations risk trending upwards. A new Head of Transformation Risk and
Assurance has joined the team to strengthen Business Transformation Risk and
Assurance.

Next steps: A Transformation Risk Assurance framework is being developed with the
key objective to gain deeper understanding of the risks (threats and opportunities)
inherent at the Project and Programme levels. Risk management remains under close
control in formal monthly risk management meetings.

Branch Technology Transformation (Replace Horizon counter application)
Implications:

Four major delivery milestones have slipped as a result of the decision to put Common
Digital Platform migration to IBM on hold. One major design and build delivery milestone
has also slipped as IBM have changed their plan. As a result the end of design milestone is
at risk. However, the overall go-live delivery date is not currently impacted.

The risk profile is increasing because milestone delivery performance and supplier plans are
putting whole programme under pressure.

Next steps: The BTTP leadership team continues to manage these “hotspot” areas
through daily management meetings.

In order to mitigate further slippage, we are holding detailed requirements and design
workshops with suppliers, to ensure we adopt the best approach.

The programme team are finalising the integration of IT partners’ (IBM and Fujitsu) activity
into the baselined plan; this will be completed by the end of January 2016.

year end. The overall risk to achieving the openings target has reduced to around 50
branch openings. Branches that are not modernised in this financial year will flow through

critical path. The first batch of activity (closures, franchises), including Paddington, are
being advertised in January 2016.

Support Services

Implications:

Elements of the programme have been delayed due to lead times for improving IT network
capacity in the Chesterfield site and availability of suppliers to undertake required
assessment. These have been caused by Post Office not knowing what the existing IT
bandwidth was at the Chesterfield site. Following consultation the St Helens site (one of the
customer service centres) invoked industrial action on 24th December and Dearne (branch
support centre) have voted for industrial action but CWU has not yet served notice for
industrial action. The programme formally announced closure of Leeds (branch support
centre) on 8th December - affecting c.50 people.

Despite the deteriorating IR landscape the programme does not anticipate any significant
deviation from the plan or material impact on benefits realisation.

Next steps:

End January deadline for validation of IT and property refit timescales and costs to ensure
Chesterfield readiness for quarter 2. Focus on critical path activities particularly IT

Implications:

Back Office Transition pre-contract due diligence recommended removing SAP-HR from the
original scope. This recommendation was agreed by Transformation Executive Steering
Group on 4th January 2016. Subsequently GE has agreed the business case for
SuccessFactors (the new enterprise HR platform) which will replace SAP-HR.

Executive Summary

Context

1. In September the Board requested internal and external options for a radical
reduction in the cost of Supply Chain (SC). Other options, such as expanding the
operation to capture market share, were considered but not taken forward.

Questions this paper addresses

2. What are our findings and recommendations if we retain ownership of SC?
3. Which options should POL progress with external partners?
4. What are the risks?

Summary Conclusions and Recommendations

5. The following conclusions and recommendations have been reached:

e We can reduce costs by optimising routes and sites, improving EBITDAS by c.
£9.5m. 235 FTE would be redundant and 10 facilities closed at a cost of £11-13m.

e We increasingly believe that the operation would be optimised if we withdraw from
the external market. This would increase redundancies to c.800 FTE, delivering a
further EBITDA improvement of c. £4m, increasing the one off cost by £19m. The
method and speed of withdrawal will now be modelled.

e Weare exploring a variety of demand reduction scenarios, which have the
potential to make a further, limited reduction in the number of deliveries required.

e We will revert in March with a consolidated, optimised view across these
opportunities. We will build a detailed implementation plan that could be put into
consultation with our people by the end of April. To plan and implement such a
fundamental restructuring will require an investment of £2-3m.

e We believe that any plan on this sort of scale will trigger industrial action. We are
developing mitigation plans for the March Board.

e Discussions for a full joint venture with Vaultex have been stopped: the outcome
was too complex for the value that could be obtained.

e There is, nonetheless, market interest in an outsource or sale of both cash
processing and CVIT. We will work with the interested parties, in private, to bring
the best options and conclusions to the Board in March, enabling a joined up set of
plans to be available for consultation. The paper sets out a number of potential
complexities with the outsource options including the impact on the Note
Circulation Scheme, VAT, public procurement and CMA referrals.

Input Sought

6. The Board is asked to comment on the findings and support the
recommendations.

CURRENT STATUS OF SUPPLY CHAIN (SC)

7. SC operates 24 CVIT depots, 3 coin centres and 4 cash processing centres, in 25
locations. 1,384 FTE are employed to deliver cash, foreign exchange and value
stock to 10.3k branches.

8. Over the last 12 months we have reduced direct costs, from £74m to £67m in
2015-16. Savings are being delivered through route and duty revisions enabling
redundancies. This is meeting a level of resistance from the CWU, with sporadic
industrial action at one depot. A further £5m of gross savings, equivalent to 3%
operational efficiencies, are in the budget for 2016-17 and this is broadly
considered deliverable without triggering widespread action.

9. Costs are offset by external income of c. £29m down from £32m as poor service,
due in part to Union restrictions, has led to a loss of activity and contracts. Other
operational measures, including safety and engagement, continue to improve.

FINANCIAL BASELINE

10.We currently incur an EBITDA loss of c. £53m, as set out below. Over the next
five years the SC baseline is therefore a net run cost of c. £265m and we would
incur some c.£10m of expected capital investment in IT, machinery etc. We are
currently working to understand cost drivers across central functions, including IT.
This will increase the true cost of running SC. The NPV of different options, set
out in paragraph 18 below, is calculated against this baseline cost.

WORK CARRIED OUT TO DATE

11. At the September Board it was agreed that we would:

e Develop internal plans and recommendations based on an investment in new
modelling capability.

e Enter a 3-month, dialogue with Vaultex and its shareholders to assess a business
combination; and

e Explore an outright sale/outsource of SC, through a corporate finance company.

12. Following implementation of a new network optimisation planning tool (CAST), we
understand the costs of serving individual branches and customers for the first
time. We have developed a financial model to estimate the economic outcomes of
potential future SC options, both internal and external.

13. We have progressed discussions with Vaultex and its shareholders. Assay, the
corporate finance advisors who successfully handled the sale of the Co-op’s CViT
business in 2014, have conducted early market testing with parties potentially
interested in an acquisition/outsource/JV option for CP/CViT.

What are our internal findings and recommendations?

SITE AND ROUTE OPTIMISATION

14. Assuming we retain ownership of SC, based on current demand, we have used the
modelling capability to run an optimal view of sites and routes. This suggests that
we can deliver demand with 10 fewer units, reducing the number of depots by 9
to 15 and shutting one coin centre. Some 235 staff would be made redundant.

15. Operating costs would fall by £8.1m per annum and capital costs (fewer vehicles)
by £1.4m. The one-off costs of redundancy and property exit would be c. £11m
and there would be implementation costs of c.£2-3m, enabling better route
planning and network management. Even assuming no benefits in Year 1 and
using a discount rate of 9%, the incremental 5 year NPV would be c. £19m.

16. Recommendation 1: We will develop a business case for approval in March, with
an operational plan ready for consultation with our people by end April. This date
may vary as we work through the timing in relation to other Union consultations.
We will add short-term resource now to enable us to understand and implement
the detailed changes which will require significant operational restructuring.

EXTERNAL REVENUE

17. We now understand the profitability of our larger customers. On our current way
of working a number are loss-making. We have undertaken a first modelling of the
impact of reducing or removing external customers, compared to the optimised
scenario above.

18. At first sight the 5 year NPV is adverse without the external customers, more
strongly so if we try to cherry pick. However, over 10 years, the NPV is favourable
without external customers and it should be noted that we are currently struggling
to hold onto external revenue and would need to invest in capability to maintain
our current scale. Our business will be simpler and easier to transform without
external contracts.

19. Recommendation 2: We will plan to withdraw from the market progressively,
creating a simpler business with lower net running costs. We will develop a
business case for approval in March, incorporating the outcomes in the operational
plan for consultation by end April. This will be subject to the affordability of
higher up-front costs. Our desire to phase withdrawal will be subject to customer
behaviour as our strategy becomes clear.

COIN

20. We have analysed the cost of providing coin into the network. Removal of all coin
collections and deliveries and the closure of coin processing facilities would result
in a stand-alone estimated cost saving of £14m per annum against the current
baseline.

21. This is a significant prize but is not consistent with our existing contracts, for
banking, for or with general change giving, or with the SGEIs that support
our funding. It may be possible to change the nature of certain products like

q ito enable small overdrafts and avoid coin payments but this is, in itself, a

cant, long-term change.

22. Recommendation 3: We will work to minimise the cost of coin over the medium

term by:

e lobbying Royal Mint and Treasury for the removal of copper - worth c. £1m per
annum;

¢ working with Royal Mint, Treasury and the industry to introduce a ‘coin utility’ in
the UK; and

¢ undertaking an alternative medium term case to operate future contracts
without coin. This would also enable a more commercial return on coin activity
if it is retained. This would be led by the Commercial and Financial Services
teams and report back to the Board in March 2017.

INTERNAL DEMAND MANAGEMENT

23. The current operation supports branches as follows:

POL No
Branches‘) Delivery
Crown 317 98%
Agency 9,804 80%
WH Smith 108 98%
Other 98 72%
Total 10,327 81%

“) there are a further 276 branches using Royal Mail Special Delivery, 53 branches self-funding their
own cash and c.900 outreach branches using a hub and spoke model.

24. The Network Team believes that there is an opportunity to reduce the number and
frequency of deliveries across the network by expanding the current alternatives.

25. Special Delivery extension:
e SC is continuing to switch delivery for certain branches to Royal Mail Special
Delivery (RMSD)
¢ This applies to low-value drops to smaller branches, within Royal Mail (RM)
limits, e.g. 10kg for coin and is dependent on RM’s appetite

26. Recommendation 4: Continue to expand RMSD as ‘business as usual’. This is
expected to be small, with no material impact on the future of SC.

POL-0027435
POL00030953
POL00030953

POST OFFICE PAGE 6 OF i1

27. Retailer self-funding:
e We currently have 53 branches which self-fund their cash requirements as part
of their wider retail business. In theory we could extend this model where there
is a good match between the cash dynamics of the retail and POL sides of the
business. The majority of such branches would be Locals and in aggregate they
might account for around a third of the network.
e Such an arrangement may be attractive to the retailers as it would reduce their
own banking costs. A number of multiples have expressed their interest in such
a model. From a POL perspective if would also lower our working capital funding
requirements and volatility.
e¢ However, there are a number of practical issues which would need to be
addressed to expand the use of this model, including:
> The necessary in-branch and back office IT changes (e.g. the model would be
more easily deployed where we have provided an IT solution that fully
integrates with the retailer’s till);

> How we would cost effectively deliver travel money and non-cash stock;

> How we would maintain the service standards required to support our
commercial propositions;

>» The risks around debt exposure; and

> Whether we would need to pay agents, off-setting SC savings

28. Recommendation 5: The Network Team will undertake more detailed research to
develop a proposed implementation plan. Our current expectation is this would
take time to implement and we are unlikely to achieve a quick reduction in SC
demand. It will therefore be excluded from the April planning.

29. Hub and spoke:

e We currently have over 900 ‘outreach’ branches where the cash is effectively
delivered through a hub and spoke model, consisting of: 670 ‘hosted outlets’
where POL services are provided in a fixed location for a few hours a week by
230 ‘travelling’ postmasters. The SC services are delivered to the postmasters’
main branch and they then use their own vehicle to shuttle the cash and stock
between the satellite branches. 267 sites are covered by a mobile Post Office
van (with each van covering an average of 7 locations). The van carries the
cash required for each of these locations.

e We expect the use of these branches to expand as they provide a more cost
effective replacement to standalone Community branches when they churn: we
are procuring a further 14 mobile vans.

¢ This infrastructure effectively provides an alternative cash distribution network
to our main SC business in rural areas, and there may be the potential to
increase utilisation by arranging for postmasters to service a greater number of
branches in their locality.

e The GE is revisiting its appetite for the risks associated with carrying cash in
unprotected vehicles.

POL00030953
POL00030953

POST OFFICE PAGE 7 OF i1

30. Recommendation 6: Identify branches where this would provide more cost
effective cash delivery and collection. The Network Team will assess the insurance
and legal issues associated with an expansion of the service, with the aim of
reaching conclusions in March. The opportunity will be included in the March
business plan and the consultation plan with colleagues in April.

CMA

41. 18 months ago, RBS abandoned a planned outsourcing of cash processing to
G4S/Vaultex based on conversations with the CMA (then the OFT). The OFT made
the following informal points: they had jurisdiction; coin and cash were separate
markets; and such a deal would have a 50% chance of referral. Any options with
incumbents should be considered under this lens, which could extend the process
materially and in public.

PUBLIC PROCUREMENT

42. Any contract to provide services back to POL should be publicly procured. Even if
we undertake substantial market testing in private, we would be undertaking the
formal assessment in public, which is likely to precipitate industrial action. The
CWU believes it managed to stop similar options being pursued, notably in 2005-
6. We are working through mitigation plans for a variety of scenarios, including
with third parties.

Recommendation 8: Review options to make direct awards
Recommendation 9: Develop contingency/mitigation plans against industrial action
for the March Board.

43. All outsource scenarios trigger higher VAT costs of c. £2-3m per annum and risk a
review of our arrangements with HMRC.

What is our long-term plan and how does this drive our short-term priorities?

It is clear that the ‘base case’ trajectory identified in June of steadily declining
volumes and fees is unsustainable in the long run. Given the time pressures outlined
above, we have a limited window of opportunity to redirect the business towards a
more sustainable end-point. In essence this requires a change in our long-term

33

This analysis will then enable us to compare the relative risks and benefits of the
different scenarios. However, it should be noted that it will not provide an empirical
answer to which provides the best option - ultimately we will have to make some
strategic judgements about what provides the best approach for our customers and
for the Post Office.

The renegotiation of the provides the main, pre-scheduled opportunity
to move towards one of these alternative scenarios, although as indicated above
there may be events which trigger a renegotiation before then, either by mutual
consent or as a result of a significant regulatory or market development. The
questions we need to address in the short-term are therefore: a) do we have a
strong preference between these scenarios at this stage; and b) based on this, what
steps should we take now to enable us to realise our preferred outcome?

For example, if we reached the conclusion now that we wanted to build the
optionality to move towards greater independence (scenario C) - either because we
believed it was the most desi le end-point, or because we judged it necessary to
strengthen our leverage over: (Oo secure a favourable extension to the:

earlier. .

pulse in 2014. The CEO explained the focus on the key areas for
improvement which included the speed of decision making.

The Board discussed the CWU ballot for industrial action on
Christmas Eve and the CEO explained the actions the Business
would take in the event of a strike, including loss of pay for those
staff who took action. The Board recognised the progress made in
industrial relations over the last three years, but were disappointed
with the prospect of a strike.

Richard Callard was asked to circulate the changes proposed
in the Trade Union Bill and the timescale for implementation.

The Distributed Denial of Service DDoS attacks on the Post Office
website had reduced with only one since the last Board meeting.
The assurance work to review the systems of the Business’ top
suppliers was underway.

The Board asked when the additional supplier review would be
completed.

The Business had received a questionnaire from the FCA as part of
contingency planning for a prolonged countrywide power failure.
The CEO reported there would be little the Business could do in
such circumstances, and the Board supported the proposed
response.

The CFO reported that the preferred candidate for the CIO role had
accepted the position and was negotiating a release date with his
existing employer. It was hoped that he would join the Post Office
in the New Year. The Current interim CIO had also been retained
until October 2016.

The CFO explained that project IRIS would be presented to the
Board in January, including options for full subcontracting

The Board asked if the Business had agreed an additional payment
for Royal Mail (RM) barcoding. The CEO explained that barcoding
had been introduced early as a favour to RM, and that the fee was
part of a wider negotiation, although she had received a letter from
RM CEO acknowledging the favour.

Having taken all of the discussion issues into account, the Board
noted the CEO’s report.

FINANCIAL REPORT

(a)

(b)

The CFO was encouraged by period 7 and year to date
performance, he was now more confident that the Business would
hit the full year EBITDAS target, however trading over the
Christmas period would be key.

The Board discussed the postmasters’ compensation error and the
effect on the balance sheet provision and exceptional items
charged in the interim and final accounts for 2014/15. The error

POL Board minutes, 25 November 2015 2 DRAFT v1

POL-0027435

Post Office Limited — Strictly Confidential

would affect both Post Office Limited and Postal Services Holding
Company Limited.

(c) The CFO explained why the error had occurred and assured the
Board that, based on the incomplete work considered to date, this
was an accounting timing issue and did not affect the payments to
postmasters or the cash position. The CFO stressed that this error
was completely unacceptable and reinforced the view he had noted
in May that the financial reporting controls had not been strong
enough. He reassured the Board that since joining the business he
was introducing new structures and individual accountabilities into
the Finance team and that a detailed project was underway to
systematically improve controls. This would take some time to
complete and more surprises could not be ruled out.

(d) The Board discussed the Interim Report and Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements as recommended by the Post
Office Audit and Risk Committee at their meeting of 10" November
2015. The Board asked the CFO to ensure the report was clear
about the accounting timing error for the postmaster provision, and
that this error did not affect any payments made to postmasters.

(e) The Board:
¢ Noted the issue relating to the postmaster’ compensation
provision, the action taken and agreed the proposed level

of disclosure;

e Approved the approach to Going Concern and agreed the
Going Concern status for Post Office Limited at the half
year;

¢ Approved the Interim Report and Condensed Financial
Statements subject to finalisation of the provision for

POLB 15/116 BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION

(a) The Chairman welcomed David Hussey, Group Transformation
Director, to the meeting.

(b) David Hussey updated the Board on the integrated Business
Transformation plan and the changes since the last update in May.

(c) He explained that a detailed integrated revised plan had been
developed which identified that the IT plans were undeliverable.
While there is greater realism embedded in the revised plan, it is
still subject to significant risk and increased costs; not least
because the plan anticipates final delivery only one month before
the expiry of the Fujitsu contract in March 2018. These costs,
together with delayed benefit realisation, pose material risks to the
delivery of the 3 year plan.

(d) The CFO explained that as a result of these risks, he had
requested that work be done to explore options to reduce both risk
to the plan and cost. This included revisiting with Fujitsu why they
had elected not to participate in the procurement for the Front
Office and other towers. Fujitsu, through these conversations, has

indicated that there may be alternative options, and the Interim CIO
had been requested to understand these options. The CFO
stressed that he was a long way from making any
recommendations to the Board but it was clearly important to
ensure that all options to reduce costs and risk were fully explored.

(e) The Board were disappointed that the risks in the Front Office plan
had not been fully understood at an earlier stage given the
extensive challenge from Board members both inside and outside
formal board meetings.

(f) The CFO was asked to go back and review the external
assurances that had been given on the existing plan.

(g) The Chairman asked the CFO to ensure that all potential
options were properly assessed — including for any legal risk,
and agreed to call an additional Board meeting by conference
call in December to consider any options that management
considered viable in all the circumstances.

Trade Union Reform

The Post Office Board requested a briefing on the Trade Union Bill. Note this summary is confidential
and for the Board only and will be updated if changes made to the Bill during its passage make this
necessary. The Bill team hopes to have the legislation reach royal assent in the spring.

The main elements of the Trade Union Bill are:

e — Introducing a 50 per cent voting threshold for union ballots turnouts, whilst retaining the
requirement for there to be a simple majority of votes in favour.

e® Introducing an additional threshold for certain important public services (the health, education,
fire, Border Force, nuclear decommissioning and transport services) so that 40 per cent of those
entitled to vote must vote in favour of industrial action. This is on top of the 50 per cent
minimum voting turnout threshold.

e Tightening the rules on ballot mandates to make sure industrial action is only taken on a recent
mandate.

© = Tackling intimidation of non-striking workers during a strike.

e Reforming the role of the Certification Officer (responsible for statutory functions relating to
trade unions and employers’ associations).

e Introducing a transparent opt-in process for unions’ subscriptions that allows members to make
an active decision to contribute to the political funds. This will reflect the existing practice in NI.

e Tightening the rules around taxpayer funded facility time for union representatives.

e Banning ‘check-off’ in the wider public sector (i.e. will require employees to set up
their own subscription rather than simply ticking a box as they join an organisation.)

e HMG will also take forward secondary legislation to remove the current ban on employers using
temporary workers to replace staff taking part in industrial action.

Post Office-specific considerations
e Post Office is not one of the ‘certain important public services’ such as transport to which
additional requirements will be placed regarding strike ballots.

e All of the strike ballots held by the CWU in recent years would still have been valid under the
new restrictions for all unions (as all had a turnout of over 50%) — incidentally, all would have
been valid had the additional public sector requirements been applied as well.

© Post Office is not included in the changes under the bill that will stop check off for civil service
departments and Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs).

POL-0027435
POL00030953
POL00030953

Should secondary legislation to end the ban on using agency workers to cover strikes be passed it
would allow Post Office to explore this option across the business, including Supply Chain.

disproportionate allocations of fixed remuneration (indirect cost) and overhead costs
as covered in note 2 below.

Note1: The direct product contribution going forward will be significantly
improved as the actual ATM remuneration cost is overstated in the P&L model
by 6% due to VAT being applied to ATMs. However as ATMs are VAT exempt
the actual cost is £1.1m lower. It should also be noted that remuneration
changes being introduced as part of extending the contract term of expired ATM
will deliver a reduction in Agent’s commission of £1.2m per annum from 17/18.
Direct product contribution would therefore increase to £17.8m.

Note 2: Fixed remuneration allocated to ATMs is apportioned on the basis of
revenue generated. As fixed remuneration is removed through NTP contractual

changes this cost will no longer be allocated to ATMs (i.e. any increase in
variable remuneration would be reported against appropriate product lines).
Additionally ATMs sit largely outside of the normal branch environment and
whilst they do take up time being managed they are not really part of the wider
infrastructure. Therefore as the allocation of 50% of overhead costs is based on
income this adversely impacts this product. At the extreme, an argument could
be made that no further overheads should be allocated beyond those relating to
time spent on managing the ATMs. This issue is still being considered as part of
P&L reporting.

Note 3: Supply Chain costs reductions will flow through to the product over

end of its agreed term. Based on the ongoing depreciation of c1,400 external ATMs
that have not yet reached the end of their planned 8 year term and operating costs of
c£2k per ATM per annum, the product contribution achieved by the bank is estimated
to be c£14m. This is similar to the DPC earned by Post Office of c£15m pa.

Basis of ATM Remuneration and Benefit to Agents

The ATM remuneration structures, which have been in use since 2005/06, are based
on combinations of fixed and variable elements that are designed to incentivise the
Agent to maximise ATM transactions. The remuneration structure is aligned with the
commissions received by POL and accounts for about 50% of this. As 8 year contracts
with Agents are reaching their end revised remuneration is now being offered that will
reduce this cost by £1.2m.

The ATM estate generates an overall income to Agents of nearly £17m per annum,
equating to an average annual income of £8.8k for an external ATM and £2.5k for an
internal. While the Agent has responsibility to load and balance the ATM the only
additional cost incurred would be for the power supply and, in Scotland only, any
business rates applied to the ATM. The ATM also acts as a footfall generator and with

Conclusion

ATMs are a key product for customers, postmasters and Post Office Limited. They
provide a significant product contribution and are a key component of Post Office
projecting a Financial Services image.

With the expiry period of ATMs shortly falling within the timeframe of th
the business is assessing options for the future.

Appendix 1
The main reasons for the improvement in EBIT for ATMs from the c£9m loss showing
on the 2014/15 P&L compared to the c£5.8m loss forecast for 2015/16 are:

1. Agents Variable pay - the 2014/15 product P&L had some complex formulas for
the calculation of Agents Variable costs, which contained some fundamental
errors in allocation to all products - most notably Mailwork as this is not a
volume driven cost but rather fixed. This resulted in the costs being overstated
in 2014-15 across all products, with the impact on ATM’s being in the region of
c£im.

2. Agents fixed Costs - in total agents fixed costs have reduced in 2015/16 by
c£17m in total for POL. As this allocation is calculated using the agents variable
pay ratio per product the net result is that Agents fixed costs in down c£2m
from 2014/15.

3. Variable net Income for ATM’s is also up £1.5m from 2014/15.

POL00030953

Period 9 Financial Performance

Context

P9 incorporates our peak trading weeks, particularly in Mails. P8 had seen lower Mails volumes; weaker renewals income in Motor and
Home insurance; and Lottery below plan. Telecoms income was also below forecast as the November price increase had not been fully
captured within the billings cycle.

Questions

What was the financial performance of the business in P9 compared to budget and forecast?
Did income recover from the impacts seen in period 8?

What are the implications of variances to forecast on our full year outlook?

How is our scorecard performance?

Conclusions
. P9 EBITDAS of £(0.5)m was £0.5m better than forecast in the period. YTD we are £0.9m ahead of forecast and £3m above
budget.
- Net income was £0.7m favourable to forecast, Expenditure £(1.1)m adverse and Project expenditure £0.9m favourable.
- Underlying performance (excluding timing and one-offs) was £(0.6)m adverse on Income and £1.2m favourable on
expenditure.

. Net Income improved on P8:
- Mails performed well over the peak period with higher volumes across most products, trading above forecast and last year.
Sustained customer activity after the last posting dates provides further evidence of a later Christmas peak.
- Lottery performance remains significantly below forecast, in line with the wider market following Camelot game changes.
- Telecoms income now reflects the full November price increase.
- Within Financial Services, stronger than anticipated performance in Business Banking partially offset disappointing
performance in MoneyGram and Gift Cards over Christmas.

. Underlying favourable performance across a number of Non-Staff cost lines was offset by a catch-up versus forecast within IT
and Marketing. Project Opex continues to fall below forecasted levels.

. Q4 challenges are emerging to the income forecast. Within Expenditure, opportunities net out, delivering our full year target of
£(34)m EBITDAS. The Group Executive will review progress weekly.

Input Sought
The Board receive and feedback on the current trading performance and our expectations for the Full Year.

Period 9 v Budget:
Income: driven by stronger Mails trading performance, lower Lottery income and Telecoms price increase. In FS, receipt of

final Hawk settlement income and higher business banking offsets withdrawal of NS&I products.

Expenditure: Non-Staff costs adverse driven by higher IT and Property maintenance costs.

Year to Date v Budget:
Income: Continued strong trading in variable Mails, Government services and Banking. More than offset by lower Travel
Insurance, the withdrawal of NS&I and lower supply chain income.

Expenditure:

+ Staff Costs adverse due to higher pensions costs (adverse market conditions at the year end).
+ Postmasters’ Costs favourable due to fixed costs benefit from higher NTP conversions in 14/15.

+ Non Staff Costs adverse due to higher property maintenance costs, additional IT licence costs, higher finance
costs (robberies, FX and Card fees). One-off Mails Segregation fees offset by Fujitsu service credit.

+ Project Opex favourable reflecting capitalisation of costs, timing of spend, and project savings

from the impact of Black Friday and customer spending patterns leading into Christmas.

+ Lottery performance was behind expectations by £(0.5)m, broadly in line with the market following product changes.
Performance in P10 is expected to improve due to the multiple roll-overs.

+ Supply Chain Income £(0.2)m below forecast signalling a risk to the full year, due to client losses and a reduction in demand

from Royal Mail.

+ In Financial Services, MoneyGram and Gift Cards performed below expectations, partially offset by stronger performance in
Business and Personal Banking: expected to mitigate full year risk within Banking & Payments.

+ Staff Costs benefited from lower than forecasted Pension costs due to lower headcount than the Q2 forecast (uplifted from the
budget assumptions); Agents variable pay was impacted by the mix of business through mains; Non Staff Cost performance
was strong across a number of operating cost lines.

+ YTD EBITDAS is £0.9m better than forecast.

Initial review of 2016/17 budget and 3 Year Plan

jors: Martin Edwards / Dave Carter Sponsor: Al Cameron Meeting date: 22" January 2016

Executive Summary

+ Context

11 The Board is due to approve the 2016/17 budget in March, together with an updated

3 Year Plan (3YP) to 2018/19.

In our existing 3YP (approved by the Board in July 2015) we targeted an
improvement in EBITDAS from £(34)m in 2015/16 to £(10)m in 2016/17, followed
by a surplus of £28m in 2017/18. Delivery of these targets is important to
demonstrate the credibility of our turnaround plans, protect our cash position and
ensure we are able to cope with declining subsidy levels.

1.2

2. Questions addressed in this report

24 How do the initial submissions compare against the targets set in the 3YP?

22 How are we going to close the gap against plan to get to our final proposed budget
and 3YP in March?

3- Conclusion

31 The initial submissions from teams (excluding any savings challenges) result in a

£101m EBITDAS loss in 2016/17 - a gap of £91m against our target, which would
persist into subsequent years if not addressed.

Net income is £27m adverse to plan in 2016/17, driven primarily by a shortfall in
financial services growth and a deterioration in POCA. Overall our assessment is
that the current income forecast is realistic, with some upside opportunity. This sets
a clear challenge for the business to adjust our cost base.

Total opex is £64m adverse to plan in 2016/17, with new cost pressures emerging
across a number of areas such as IT.

To close the gap to plan across the period, the GE agreed before Christmas to target
savings of £110m pa from 2016/17. In a number of areas work is well advanced to
deliver these savings, such as pensions and Iris. A detailed list of projects and
accountabilities has been agreed and weekly governance arrangements established.

The Report

Overview of our standard cycle of financial planning documents
The key product which the Board needs to approve before the end of March is our
budget for 2016/17. Aside from being necessary to run the business, we are
required to submit this document to BIS before the start of the new financial year
under the terms of our funding agreement.
Last year we also introduced a 3YP: this is not a specific HMG requirement, but we
decided it would be an appropriate discipline to strengthen our medium-term
financial and strategic planning. We committed to update this document each year
to cover a rolling 3 year period. While last year the 3YP was approved in July
subsequent to the sign-off of the annual budget, we decided to run both as a single
process in future years, running to the same timetable.
It should be noted that our new 3YP extends to 2018/19, one year beyond the end of
our current funding agreement. Between March and June we will be updating our
projections to 2020/21, as the basis for the funding negotiations later this year.

Summary of the targets in our current 3YP (2015/16 to 2017/18)
As the chart below shows, the existing 3YP delivers an £88m cumulative EBITDAS
improvement by 2017/18, relative to a 2014/15 baseline. This would result in a pre-
subsidy profit in 2017/18 for the first time in 15 years. The forecast improvement
was driven by a combination of: a) overall net income growth of around 1.5% CAGR,
with FS and telecoms growth offsetting the declines in mails and government
services; and b) net cost reductions of 1.6% CAGR, delivered through network and
Crown transformation, staff savings and renegotiation of supplier costs. Delivering
this rate of profit improvement is necessary to cope with declining subsidy levels.

Overview of the initial budget submissions

The table below summarises the updated outlook to 2018/19 based on the first
round of submissions from teams. It highlights a significant gap to plan in 2016/17
of £91m, primarily driven on the cost side as explained in more detail below. In
2017/18 the gap against plan reduces, but only because we have maintained the
assumptions included in the previous 3YP on staff and supplier savings (which total
£28m). The underlying gap remains broadly the same as in 2016/17. FS growth
falls further behind trajectory, but this is partly offset by the improvement in mails
relative to plan. The key takeaway is that we need to focus on right-sizing our
cost base in 2016/17 to close the gap that year, which should also largely
return us to plan in subsequent years.

Overall net income is £27m lower than plan, with the top line deteriorating by £29m
year-on-year (having remained broadly flat over this and the previous year). Overall
FS income is flat year-on-year in 2016/17, compared against the 10% growth
expected in the current 3YP. The main drivers of this shortfall are the delays in the
launch of new insurance, investment and digital payments products, the removal of
the savings underpin from Bank of Ireland (which we are currently renegotiating)
and trading challenges in a range of other products. Within FS the shortfall is partly
offset by the launch of the new Banking Framework.

Outside of FS the main positive variance against plan is in mails: we expected 3% pa
declines in the 3YP, but based on trading performance in the current year are now
forecasting a more gradual decline of less than 1% pa. As the separate mails
strategy paper sets out, we still believe there are significant structural risks to our
business based on the current arrangements with Royal Mail.

Our assessment at this stage is that the income forecast for 2016/17 represents a
realistic and prudent basis on which to set our cost targets. There is some upside

opportunity to these numbers, particularly if we can secure new government services
income and reach agreement with the ' IRRELEVANT /on the issues around savings,
jowever, until ¥ T

Hl have a firmer view of these areas we

se as upside opportunities, therefore setting a more
stretching challenge on costs to get back to plan. The pattern in previous years has
been to start with income forecasts that have proved to be too optimistic, leaving
the business less well prepared to implement mitigating actions on the cost side in-
year.

Based on first submissions the underlying cost base is expected to increase by £46m
year-on-year, creating a £64m gap against the 3YP target for 2016/17. This is
driven by: a) cost pressures across the business, particularly in IT, property and
commercial; and b) the fact that these initial numbers do not include the savings
challenges we included in the 3YP. As outlined below we are re-applying these
challenges as part of our plan to close the gap.

Our plan to close the gap
These initial projections expose the fact that fundamentally our cost base is still at
the wrong level to support our top line position, despite the savings that have been
delivered across the business over the past two years. We therefore need to
accelerate the thinking around the more radical changes to our operating model
which we had identified as necessary to support our long-term competitiveness. This
will be informed by a detailed analysis of our cost base and drivers which is currently
underway.
To close the gap between now and the March Board we have set the business an
EBITDAS improvement target of £110m in 2016/17 (including contingency above our
£91m gap). The majority of this has been allocated as a cost challenge, with only
£6m set as a target for profit improvement from higher income.
The programme plan which accompanies this paper (which is best printed A3)
outlines how the £104m cost challenge has been allocated across different areas of
the business, alongside a short description of the specific projects and governance
arrangements to deliver these targets. The whole process will be overseen by
weekly meetings of the Cost Reduction Group attended by the CEO and CFO, to
ensure the necessary degree of scrutiny and challenge.

Overview of the position on investment spend (capex and excep tionals)

At present based on first submissions we also face an overspend on our below the
line investment budget. While this doesn’t affect our profit targets, getting back to
plan is critical to maintain adequate balance sheet headroom throughout the forecast
period. The biggest single driver of the variance relates to IT costs, and the decision
on Trinity will have a significant bearing on whether we can eliminate this overspend.
Overall we have sufficient discretionary flexibility across our investment budget to
get back to plan, but further work is required to assess the trade-offs against our

profit position both in the short and long term. It should be noted that at this we
have not budgeted for substantial redundancy costs, which may be required to
deliver the opex savings. We will provide a full update on the proposed investment
budget in March, aligned to the P&L projections.

The links to our wider strategic planning
We clearly need to ensure that the plans we develop to deliver the 2016/17 budget
and the new 3YP to 2018/19 are aligned with our longer-term strategic ambitions.
Between March and the June Board strategy awayday we will be developing a full
draft of our new Strategic Plan covering the period up to 2020/21, which will then
form the basis of our funding negotiations with BIS for the last three years of this
plan.
As noted above, to close the gap on our short-term plans we need to accelerate the
more radical options to transform our cost base. While some of these options will
entail strategic trade-offs with our capacity to deliver top line growth, our view at
this stage is that it is right to focus on addressing costs to establish a simpler and
cheaper operating model. Fundamentally our business model is based on being a
retail distributor for products and services manufactured by other companies. To
survive as an intermediary in competitive markets our cost base needs to be as lean
as possible so we are in a position to negotiate on fees. Therefore acting now to
reduce costs should in broad terms be seen as a ‘no regrets’ decision.
There will be time set aside at the March Board to discuss the alignment between our
short and long-term trade-offs at a more granular level, to inform the debate on the
budget and 3YP. We will also present a first draft of our longer-term financial
projections to 2020/21, together with an explanation of what this means in terms of
potential scenarios for our next round of funding discussions. This will be followed
by further work between March and June on our longer-term commercial plans and
partnerships, particularly in mails and FS, ahead of a full debate at the strategy
awayday.

Project Trinity Update

or: Alison Japp Sponsor: AlCameron Date: January 2016

Executive Summary

Context

1. At the last Board, we discussed options that would reduce the complexity, risk
and cost associated with IT Transformation including the option to retain
Horizon, the existing branch software provided by Fujitsu (Project Trinity).

2. We have explored three options:
« Proceed with IBM as per the current implementation plan
« Re-negotiate with IBM to see if by reducing their scope, we can reduce costs,
time and execution risk
« Terminate the IBM contract, retain the existing Fujitsu contract and build on
the existing Horizon infrastructure as necessary.

Questions this paper addresses
3. The purpose of this paper is to update the Board on the progress; providing fuller
responses to the questions raised at last Board:
e Is there a compelling case for Project Trinity?
e Is there a way to manage the legal and commercial risk?
« What are the next steps?

Conclusions

4. There is a compelling case for Project Trinity. It provides a substantial reduction
in complexity; operational risk and a £69m cost reduction over three years,
reducing to £15m after seven years. The IBM options, as outlined above, have
not yet demonstrated that they would provide a substantive reduction in
complexity, risk or cost.

5. There are routes to manage the legal and commercial risks. Detailed advice has
been obtained from Counsel and additional analysis undertaken by Gartner to
better understand which route will be most effective. The Board will be updated
at the meeting.

6. We plan to revert to the Board with a final recommendation during February.

Input Sought
7. The Board is asked to highlight any additional issues that they wish addressed
prior to a final recommendation being brought to the Board in February.

The Report

Context

Since the last board we have focused on developing a fuller understanding of
these options ensuring that the proposed solution meets our success criteria:
¢ Clear financial benefits on a like for like basis

e Acceptable legal and procurement risks

e A significant reduction in delivery risk

¢ Confidence that the solution works

e Additional functionality can be added simply, at an acceptable cost, in an
acceptable timescale

e Improved management controls & processes, mitigating any Sparrow related
risks

e Impacts on the integrated plan and contracts beyond Front Office are
manageable

e Clear communications strategy for multiple stakeholders, with government
acceptance

e Confidence that the supplier will behave as partners, making change easy and
cost effective as it evolves beyond what we know we need today

e Credible governance structure to manage supplier contractually and day to
day, engaging with business leadership as well as IT

We have made significant progress with only a small number of outstanding
actions:
e Conclusion of commercial negotiations with Fujitsu and IBM

e Finalisation of the approach to procurement and contracting
e Confirmation that the solution works (test of the Fujitsu solution started on
18 January)

A verbal update will be provided on these outstanding areas at the Board.

Is there a compelling case for Project Trinity?

Option A: Proceed with IBM as per the current implementation plan.

10.

11.

We are in the process of carrying out a full review with IBM of the costs, delivery
risks and delivery plans that underpin our current plan with IBM. Within the
current scope, approach and implementation plans there are no additional
actions that can be taken at this point that will substantially reduce complexity,
risk or cost.

We believe the current plan is under threat due to supplier dates slipping and the
operational and delivery risk remain high.

POL00030953
POL00030953

POST OFFICE PAGE 3

Option B: Re-negotiate with IBM to see if by reducing their scope, we can reduce
costs, time and execution risk

12.

POL and IBM reviewed the current scope, technical design and delivery plan with
the aim of identifying options that would reduce complexity, cost and risk.
Fundamentally, no suggestions from IBM have materially changed the plan and
increasingly promote leaving more services with Fujitsu.

Option C: Terminate the IBM contract, retain the existing Fujitsu contract and build
on the existing Horizon infrastructure as necessary. (Project Trinity)

13.

14.

This option does provide a substantial reduction in complexity and operational
risk and a £69M cost reduction over three years, reducing to £15M after seven
years. Further options are under discussion to adopt an invest to save option
that provide an additional 5% saving year on year run cost saving assuming a 3
year investment. These figures are now significantly more robust and provide a
reasonable estimate of costs.

We continue to challenge Fujitsu on the run costs and to ensure that we are
developing a better, partnership spirit in the relationship. This is patchy.

Is there a way to manage the legal and procurement risks

15.

16.

17.

18.

Counsel has confirmed that termination of the contract with IBM does not give
rise to any breach of procurement law. However the way in which POL procures
replacement services is open to challenge if POL makes a direct award to Fujitsu,
fails to run a transparent procurement process and it cannot rely on any
available exemptions under the Public Contract Regulations 2015.

As outlined in our last update to Board there are a variety of procurement routes
available. We are currently exploring whether a direct award to Fujitsu could be
possible under the terms of an exemption under Regulation 32 which allows
direct awards where, inter alia, the services can be supplied only by one provider
where: (i) competition is absent for technical reasons or (ii) because of the
protection of exclusive rights including IP rights, provided that no reasonable
alternative or substitute exists and the absence of competition is not the result of
an artificial narrowing down of the parameters of the procurement.

If this exemption is available, it would substantially reduce the risk of challenge
and of an award to Fujitsu being declared invalid. It would also mitigate
previously highlighted risks of an action against either POL or the Board for f
misfeasance in public office.

While at a practical and commercial level, Fujitsu appears to be uniquely placed
to provide this service, this is not of itself sufficient to prove that there is no
competition for technical reasons..

POST OFFICE PAGE 4

19. Accordingly we have commissioned Gartner to provide an assessment, via a
desk-top analysis, if there are likely to be suppliers that would be capable and
potentially interested in delivering our specification. This will inform our
assessment of whether we fall within the scope of the exemption provided by
regulation 32. An update will be provided verbally at the Board.

20. Depending on the nature of the findings, three further options exist to support an
award:
. Expanding the Gartner conversation to interactions with potential
suppliers. This is likely to be appropriate to give the Board confidence.
. Publishing details of the award or the intention to award.
. Re-procuring the services.

Next Steps

21. The priorities are to confirm the approach to procurement of continuation of our
existing Horizon solution and finalise commercial negotiations with Fujitsu. Once
confirmed we will be able to complete an outline business case, finalise high level
delivery plans, and undertake a final assurance review (the requested “Red Team
Review”), with Deloittes, our Business Transformation Assurance partner.

22. We will look to recommend to the Board a final way forward in February. The
Deloitte assurance will be provided to the Board at the same time as the request
for Board approval.

POST OFFICE BOARD DECISION PAPER

ecision Paper — Delegated Authorities II

Author & Sponsor: Jane MacLeod Meeting date:

Executive Summary

Context

A paper on Delegated Authorities was presented to the Board on 28°" October 2015,
this paper is attached for easy of reference.

At the meeting the Board discussed the proposed delegated authorities and debated
whether the authorities had been set at the right level. The Chairman asked the
General Counsel to provide further information on the number of contracts being
signed at the levels proposed and any benchmark data available from other
organisations, especially ShEx Businesses.

After discussion between the General Counsel and the Chairman new delegated
authorities are proposed for Board approval.

* Question addressed in this report

What delegated authority levels should the Board set for the Business?

Conclusion

The Board currently delegates authority to the Group Executive for contracts below
£20m in value. It is recognised that best practice delegates authority to the CEO and
not to an Executive team. The analysis on contracts signed shows that, in the last
two years c. 20 contracts were signed with a value between £5m and £20m.

After consideration a new delegated authority level of £5m is proposed with all
expenditure above that level requiring Board approval. (This would not include
operation BAU expenditure such as the monthly pay/agents remuneration bill or
operational costs such as rents, rates or utility costs).

A process will be put in place to ensure the Board are able to respond to urgent
requests which require approval by correspondence.

Recommendation. The Board approve the new delegated authorities as set out in

Decision Paper — Delegated Authorities

Author & Sponsor: Jane MacLeod Date: 28 October 2015

Executive Summary

Context

In accordance with the principles of good governance, the Board delegates authority
to the Chief Executive to implement the Board approved strategy; this delegation
includes specific limits on the financial authority of the CEO. Post Office delegated
authorities were last reviewed in 2012. In light of the changes to Post Office’s
transformation plans and the change of a number of senior executive roles during that
period, it is therefore recommended that the Board review these authorities.

In addition, a number of Post Office executives are authorised to sign contracts on
behalf of Post Office Limited. This includes individuals other than directors or persons
acting under a formal power of attorney. Accordingly the Post Office Board should
confirm that these named individuals are authorised as signatories.

Questions addressed in this report

What changes should be made to the delegated authorities and authorised
signatories?

Conclusion

1. The current delegated authorities which date back to 2012 are set out in Appendix
1. Due to changes in personnel and governance processes it is recommended that
the delegated authorities be amended to those set out in Appendix 2. The key
changes are:

. Top level delegation is to the CEO rather than to a committee (GE/Exco)

. CEO delegates authority up to £15m to the CFO and up to £5m to each GE
member

. There is no delegated authority for ‘unplanned’ spend

e There is no distinction between costs and liabilities

. Additional authority may be delegated to individual SLT members if so
required, up to the limit of the responsible GE member.

2. In order to facilitate the execution of contracts by Post Office Limited, the contract
approval process has been updated. As a result, the list of approved signatories is
also being reviewed to ensure that it is up to date. The proposed list of Authorised
Signatories is set out in Appendix 3.

3. If approved by the Board, it is proposed that the delegations and authorised
signatories will become effective as from 1 November 2015.

New Prosecutions Policy Proposal

Author & Sponsor: Jane MacLeod Date: 22 January 2016

Executive Summary

Context

Prior to separation, RMG prosecuted suspected criminal activity in the Post Office
network in England and Wales. Since separation, Post Office has assumed this
function, adopting essentially the same policy as previously applied by RMG.
Prosecuting suspected criminal activity in the Post Office network assists the
protection of Post Office assets by deterring criminal activity.

As good housekeeping following separation from Royal Mail, and in light of public
criticisms of Post Office which arose in relation to ‘Project Sparrow’, we have reviewed
the Post Office prosecutions policy to ensure that the policy is robust and continues to
meet best practice.

Questions addressed in this paper

L. What are the key points to note about the new policy?
2. What are the implications for the board and the business?
3. What happens to cases that are not approved for prosecution?

Conclusion

i. The new policy replaces the previous policy which was inherited from Royal
Mail. It sets out the requirements which must be met before Post Office can
launch a prosecution including in particular, the Code for Crown Prosecutors
(issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions) which require the prosecution to
be in the public interest, and for there to be evidence sufficient to provide a
realistic prospect of conviction

2. Where a case is not approved for prosecution in accordance with the Policy, it is
likely that civil remedies would be pursued (eg contract enforcement or
recovery of debts) as well as other steps as described in the Appendix.

Input Sought: The Board is requested to note the Policy.

Input Received: The draft policy was reviewed by Post Office Legal, Cartwright
King (Post Office Limited’s legal advisers on criminal matters to) and Brian Altman QC.
It was approved by the Group Executive on 17 December 2015.

The Report

Why do we need to create this policy?

Ls On 26 February 2014, the Post Office Board formally approved “pursuing a
prosecutions policy focussed only on high value cases/cases involving
vulnerable members of society, and engaging with the police in relation to other
matters”. Adopting the updated Prosecution Policy Post Office will enable
continue to be able to bring private prosecutions focussing on high value cases
and/or those involving vulnerable members of society.

2. The proposed policy sets out the approach that Post Office will take when
considering whether to commence a prosecution. The final decision as to
whether Post Office Limited should commence prosecution will be taken by the
General Counsel.

What are the key points to note about our new policy?
Ss The draft Policy:

e explains Post Office’s approach to suspected criminal activity against Post
Office business in England and Wales;

e expressly states that a prosecution can only be brought where the evidence
in the case passes the same two-stage test used by the CPS;

e lists a number of public interest factors which might support bringing a
prosecution; and

¢ empowers Post Office’s General Counsel to authorise prosecutions.

What are the implications for the board and the business?

4. No particular steps are required to roll out and embed the policy as this will be
the responsibility of Post Office Legal and its external advisers on criminal law.
However we have been advised that the policy should be available on the Post
Office Limited website, and that this is consistent with the practice of other
organisations which conduct their own prosecutions.

5- Where an investigation is conducted and there is deemed to be sufficient prima
facie evidence to support a charge and meet the public interest test, the
investigation case papers are referred to Post Office’s external lawyers who
review the case against the same criteria and provide formal advice/opinion and
a recommendation on whether to prosecute or not. The General Counsel is the
business decision maker on the final decision of prosecution.

6. Where a prosecution is commenced, the case is kept under constant review to
ensure that it continues to meet the evidential and public purpose tests; if not,
the case is withdrawn.

POL-0027435
POL00030953
POL00030953

POST OFFICE PAGE 3 OF 3

How will we monitor compliance with this policy?

7. It will be the responsibility of the General Counsel to ensure compliance with
the Policy. A report will be provided to the Board Audit & Risk Committee
annually detailing the number of cases that have been referred to prosecution
and confirming that in each case the requirements of the Policy have been
complied with.

What will the impact be on our wider business?
8. We do not expect there to be any adverse impact on Post Office business,

however the existence of the Policy may assist in discouraging criminal
activities within Post Office.

INTRODUCTION

Post Office Limited is a private limited company, wholly owned by

Government.

It has been entrusted by Government to provide a number of services of
general economic interest to the public through its branches across the UK.

Criminal offences against Post Office Limited’s business, in particular theft,
fraud and false accounting, adversely impact its customers and commercial
partners, and challenge the viability of the services Post Office Limited

provides.

Post Office Limited is committed to deterring and reducing criminal
offending against its business by investigating offences, and by taking such

action as it considers appropriate in the circumstances of the case.

POLICY SCOPE

Post Office Limited has been an independent company since its separation
from Royal Mail Group on 1° April 2012, retaining an investigative and

prosecution function.

In England and Wales, Post Office Limited performs both investigative
and prosecuting functions using external service providers for some of

these functions.

In Scotland and Northern Ireland, Post Office Limited’s Security Team
carries out investigations and decides whether to refer a matter to the
Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in Scotland, or to the Public
Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland. Post Office Limited does not
make the decision to prosecute, nor does it carry on prosecutions, in
Scotland or Northern Ireland.

The present policy is intended to explain the approach that Post Office
Limited will adopt when it is suspected that crime has been committed

against its business in England and Wales.

This policy applies equally to Post Office Limited employees, postmasters,
operators, contractors and customers, as well as to any other person
alleged to have committed a criminal offence against its business in
England and Wales.

ENFORCEMENT OPTIONS

Post Office Limited’s “Contract Breach” policy document ' sets out how
Post Office Limited decision makers may act in relation to serious breaches
of contract by postmasters operating postmaster contracts, and by
operators of the New Model Contracts.

Where applicable, Post Office Limited will have regard to the terms of the
“Contract Breach” policy before considering whether or not prosecution

will be the most appropriate response to an allegation of crime.

If a criminal investigation is considered appropriate, it will be conducted
by Post Office Limited’s Security Team in accordance with the “Conduct

of Criminal Investigations Policy” document.?

Post Office Limited often works in partnership with police forces and other
enforcement agencies, particularly in cases where offences are alleged to
have been committed by persons who are not Post Office Limited staff,
agents or contractors, or where violence is alleged to have been threatened
or used against Post Office Limited personnel or property, or where
offences are alleged to have been committed against both Post Office

Limited assets and/or personnel and assets of another agency.

In cases of the type referred to in paragraph 4.4, Post Office Limited may:

4.5.1 invite the police and/or other enforcement agencies to investigate the

allegation(s);

4.5.2 pursue a joint investigation with police and/or other enforcement

agencies;

4.5.3 investigate the allegations without recourse to police or other outside

agencies;

4.5.4 invite another prosecuting agency to prosecute the matter;

4.5.5 pursue a joint prosecution with another prosecuting agency; or

4.5.6 pursue a prosecution without recourse to another prosecuting agency.

4.6 — The choice of enforcement option may depend on factors such as, but not
limited to, those matters set out in paragraphs 5.7 and 6.3 below, as well as
the likelihood of non-compliance with, and the likely effectiveness or
consequences of, any other enforcement options available.

4.7. Where the nature of the offence is so serious or the shortage or loss so
substantial that enforcement action other than criminal action is
inadequate and might lead to delaying criminal investigation and
enforcement, Post Office Limited may move expeditiously to take criminal

enforcement action.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT

When making any decision whether to prosecute a person for a criminal
offence, Post Office Limited will apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors
issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions,3 as well as the further

considerations set out in this policy document.

The decision whether to prosecute in any individual case will be taken with due
diligence and expedition.

Post Office Limited will have regard to the Human Rights Act 1998 and the
European Convention on Human Rights.

Post Office Limited will comply with the: +

e disclosure obligations under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act
1996 (and the Code of Practice issued thereunder);

e Protocol for the Control and Management of Unused Material in the
Crown Court;

e Attorney General’s guidelines on Disclosure and on the Disclosure of
Digitally-Stored Material;

° Criminal Procedure Rules and the Criminal Practice Directions;

e Attorney General’s guidelines on the Acceptance of Pleas; and

Each case will be approached according to general principles of fairness,

consistency and proportionality.

Fairness and consistency do not require Post Office Limited to take a
uniform approach in every case; rather it means adopting a similar
approach in similar circumstances to achieve similar ends, taking into

account the particular circumstances of each case.

5.7. Proportionality means that Post Office Limited action will be
proportionate to the seriousness of the offence, the strength of the
evidence against the alleged offender, the harm done by the offence, the
impact of the offence on the community and on the services Post Office
Limited provides and its business, taking into account the costs to Post
Office Limited of investigation and prosecution as weighed against the

likely outcome.

6. THE DECISION TO PROSECUTE

6.1 A prosecution can only be brought where the evidence passes the two-stage

test for prosecution set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. 5

6.2 In order to satisfy the two-stage test referred to above (the “Full Code test”):

6.2.1. there must be evidence sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of

conviction (the “evidential stage”); and

6.2.2 the prosecution must be in the public interest (the “public interest

stage”).

6.3 Where the evidential stage of the Full Code test is satisfied, in addition to the
public interest factors set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, additional

public interest factors that might justify a prosecution by Post Office Limited

include where:

members of the public have suffered loss;

a victim of the offence was particularly vulnerable (for example by
reason of age, infirmity or physical or mental disability);

the offence involves a serious or significant breach of trust;

the actual amount of the shortage or loss to Post Office Limited, in
particular where the conduct has resulted in a significant or
substantial financial shortage or loss;

the offence has or is likely to have an adverse impact on Post Office
Limited’s business, brand, image or reputation;

the offence (or the concealment of the offence) is sophisticated,
involves multiple transactions, or was committed over a lengthy
period of time;

there is a history of similar past offences or misconduct;

an innocent party has been falsely blamed or accused;

the particular circumstances of the offender (such as his/her age,

physical or mental condition, his/her general character or

reputation, whether there is an absence of evidence of any previous
offending or default);

e the particular circumstances of the offence (such as the pattern of
offending, and whether it was, for instance, the result of deliberately
calculated acts to benefit the offender);

e — whether any or all of the shortage or loss has been (or realistically
will be) repaid to Post Office Limited;

e any early voluntary disclosure or confession by the offender;

. the deterrent effect of a prosecution on the offender and others;

e any unreasonable or inordinate delay by Post Office Limited in
reaching a decision;

e the cost of prosecution to Post Office Limited relative to the likely
penalty on conviction and likely recovery of loss or shortage
(although no decision will be made on this factor alone).

Following a decision to prosecute, Post Office Limited will keep the case under
continuous review. Should it appear to Post Office Limited at any time that the
case no longer satisfies the evidential stage of the Full Code test, or should
Post Office Limited conclude that a prosecution no longer satisfies the public
interest stage of the Full Code test, then Post Office Limited will discontinue

the case without undue delay.
6.5 No prosecution will be commenced or continued in circumstances where it is,

or it becomes likely, that the courts may regard the prosecution as oppressive,

unfair or an abuse of the process of the court.

DECISION MAKING

The decision to authorise prosecution, or any other decision under this
policy, will be taken by the General Counsel for Post Office Limited, or any
other member of the Post Office Legal Team to whom the General Counsel
may delegate that authority, acting from time to time on the advice of
external lawyers.

The decision to prosecute will be taken openly and transparently. The
decision and the underlying reasons for it will be recorded in writing and
retained by Post Office Limited until the expiry of a period of not less than

six years following the conclusion of the case.

Prosecutions in the Magistrates’ Court and the Crown Court are conducted
by Post Office Limited’s in-house lawyers, external lawyers or appointed
agents.

8. RECOVERY: CONFISCATION, COMPENSATION AND COSTS

8.1 Post Office will in each case consider whether or not to exercise its rights to
recover any shortage or loss resulting from the offender’s criminal conduct,
as well as the costs of prosecution, subject to the general principles of

fairness, consistency and proportionality.

8.2 Where Post Office Limited seeks to exercise its rights to recover a shortage

or loss, it will do so by seeking orders for:

e Restraint against assets owned or controlled by suspects;

e Confiscation under the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act
2002;

e Compensation;

e — Costs covering the investigation and prosecution; or

e — Any combination of such or similar orders.

THE ACCEPTANCE OF GUILTY PLEAS

In appropriate cases prosecutors will consider whether any offer of a plea to
any particular charge meets with the scope and objectives of this Policy.

The decision whether to accept any offer of a plea or pleas rests with Post
Office Limited only, acting on the advice of the prosecutor.

In cases where a defendant seeks to admit guilt on a basis other than that
advanced by the prosecutor, Post Office Limited will only consider an offer
of a plea or pleas where the offer is expressed in writing and in the form of a
recognised ‘Basis of Plea’ document signed by the defendant or on his/her
behalf by his/her representative. Post Office Limited is not bound to accept
any such offer of plea or pleas.

In cases where the charges are expressed in the alternative and the
defendant accepts the prosecution case without qualification, Post Office
Limited will consider whether to accept a plea or pleas of guilty to
particular charges by reference to the scope and objectives of this Policy.

In cases where the charges are expressed in the alternative and the
defendant seeks to admit guilt to particular charges on a basis other than
that advanced by the prosecutor, paragraph 9.3 of this Policy will apply.

In any case where a defendant seeks to enter a guilty plea or pleas on a
basis not agreed by Post Office Limited, Post Office Limited will invite the
court to hear evidence to determine the facts upon which the defendant is

to be sentenced.
