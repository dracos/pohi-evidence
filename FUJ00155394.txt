RE: Proposed Slides for ARQ Service Issue

The slides were presented to Steve Denham on behalf of Wendy Wednesday afternoon. He is now aware of the problem and is
going to talk with Legal. In the meantime we will be progressing with the CP.

Graham, thanks for your comments. I have made some adjustments to the presentation and/or added comments
below:-

Do we need to add to the last point on slide 2 that although we know of no instance when we will not get an error
which will indicate incompleteness we cannot guarantee this.

Tivoli event data is known to be incomplete, viz turn off TECs during event storms, gaps in the events sequences
generated by OMDB, there are occasional corrupt records within the events audit tracks

Do we need to add something about if we do find a gap we do not know what to do about this? If we do say this we will
need to say what we are doing to progress a solution to this or what the options are to tell POL that we can't provide
data??

Added to slide 5

Slide 3 I think the second point should say ‘prone to human error’ I am presuming if we automated this the error
indicated in this point would be removed
It's not just human error, the process is not secure. But yes, that's my belief, partially automating will remove this point

Slide 3, why does the CP not suggest full automation or does it automate as much as possible in which case it should
probably be worded like that.
We cannot fully automate, we will always need someone to check unfiltered errors

Need a final slide saying what we want the audience to help with. I think we mentioned 2 things
FUJ00155394
FUJ00155394

1. Support the CP.
2. Provide guidance on the immediate issue of the witness statements.
Item (1) added to slide 4, item (2) already there

Amended presentation attached. Please let me know if I havn't fully covered your comments, or if any others have
been identified.

Kind regards
Penny
