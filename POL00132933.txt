Subject: RE: Latest Draft POL Letter to SS Part Two Recipients

Thanks Angela
I suggest, as you are still without a laptop that I send the following to the Working group on your behalf:
Angela has asked me to pass on the following message to the Working Group as she is presently without a laptop.

All,

As you are aware Post Office has expressed concerns about the Second Sight Part Two Report as drafted and issued to
Applicants and Advisors yesterday. In the interests of transparency I wanted to inform you that I am today writing to
the recipients of the Part Two Report to set out Post Office’s position.

The text of the letter is:

Dear [Applicant]

Post Office Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme (the “Scheme”) - Second Sight's “Part Two” Report (the
“Report”)

You should now have received a copy of Second Sight’s “Part Two” Report.

I must stress that the Report is not endorsed by Post Office. This is because Post Office believes that the Report is
inaccurate in important areas, that there is no clear statement of the evidence upon which many of the opinions
expressed in the Report are based, and that it includes matters which are beyond the scope of the Scheme and/or
Second Sight’s professional expertise as forensic accountants.

I will write again setting out Post Office's detailed position on the various points raised in the Report to help you
assess whether those points apply in the specific circumstances of your case. I would suggest therefore that

you consider the Report in the context of that position, which will be sent to you within the next couple of weeks.

lam sorry for having to send this letter to you, but believe it important to make you aware of Post Office's position on
the Report at the earliest opportunity.

I am copying this to your professional advisor.
Yours sincerely

Thanks Angela

No problem on last minute changes, it’s important that we get this right and that, as it is going out in your name you
are happy with it.

Final draft is as below. I have, as Chris suggested, moved the apology to the end.
I think it unlikely that JFSA will share a copy of their draft with us. However we can ask.

Copied Lucy as she will now put this onto headed paper and get it ready to go.

Belinda,

I have suggested a few stylistic changes to the letter. I'm sorry to do this at this late stage but I feel the changes are
necessary especially if JFSA is also writing to the Applicant.

T agree that we should as a courtesy provide a copy of the letter to the JFSA and SS. Is JFSA planning to provide us
with a copy of their letter to Applicants?

Thanks,
Angela

Angela

A final draft as agreed by Brunswick. Subject to your views, this will go out today.

Alan has asked whether POL intends to send a letter to applicants as JFSA plan also to write. As they will get a copy of
this from applicants and advisors I suggest, in the interests of transparency we send them and Second Sight a copy so
that they are aware.

I would be grateful for views on that.

Best wishes
Belinda
