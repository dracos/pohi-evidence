1.0 Introduction

The On Line Services Report Set produced by Fujitsu has been designed to enable
Network Banking (NWB) including Alliance & Leicester, Card Account for Post
Office (CAPO), LINK, Debit & Credit Card (D&CC) and Electronic Top Up (ETU)
transactions completed in the Post Office branches to allow settlement to be made with
Post Office Clients, e.g. LINK, or direct settlement to specific clients or financial
institutions. Five separate Report Sets for Banking, D&CC and ETU are produced as
listed below. See also sections 3.1 & 3.2 of this document for a full description of the
format and content:

On Line Service Report Title Report Title
Banking: LINK NBIOIL NB102
Banking: Alliance & Leicester NBIOI NB102
Banking: CAPO NBI1O1 NB102
E Top Up NBIOI NB102
Debit & Credit Card (Streamline) NBIOL NB102

Fujitsu central systems will produce the On Line Services Report Set for each of the
above streams in accordance with the rules documented within ‘CS/SPE/011: Network
Banking End-to-End Reconciliation Reporting’. This Report Set will reconcile all the
individual transaction components making an On Line Services transaction.
Reconciliation is driven to allow the counter reconciling with the ‘Client, i.e. the
Financial Institution’.

In addition to those exceptions reported by Fujitsu within the On Line Services Report
Set, reconciliation errors may be discovered by Post Office Ltd Finance (POL
Finance). when reconciling data within its own systems or relating to queries from Post
Office Clients. To initiate the Business Incident Management (BIM) process, Fujitsu
Management Support Unit (MSU), or generates On Line Services Business Incidents
for one or more exceptions or reconciliation errors discovered.

The incident management process is generic for all services. Electronic Point of Sale
Service (EPOSS), Automated Payment Service (APS) and On Line Services incidents
are raised, documented and progressed to resolution in the same manner.

It should be noted however, that where an On Line Services incident does not affect
reconciliation within POLFS Manual Error Report (MER) charging does NOT apply.

Definition and charges for On Line Services / Transaction Processing Service (TPS)
related errors, where the incident has caused a reconciliation or settlement error within
POLFS are found in associated Fujitsu Contract Controlled Document (CCD) entitled:
“CS/PRO/111: TPS Reconciliation & Incident Management’

2.0 Scope

This document sets out the reconciliation and incident management procedures to be
adopted by Fujitsu MSU for dealing with On Line Services Report Set distribution to
Post Office Ltd, and any associated On Line Services Business Incidents which may
arise, including:

On Line Services reconciliation report exceptions and incomplete states
Software faults affecting reconciliation and settlement

Post Office Client enquiries / disputed banking transactions

On Line Services reconciliation reports

The present revision of the document is needed to describe the changes brought about
by S70/75/80, specifically the removal of the Network Banking Engine (NBE), the
removal of the Cash Account which is being replaced by the Branch Trading Statement
(BTS) (thus the removal of the NB103 report) and the migration from Post Office Ltd
Operational Transaction Information Processing (OPTIP) to POLFS,

3.0 Reports produced by Fujitsu central systems

This section is intended to give an overview of the working of each reconciliation report
available. It is not intended as a reference point in the design of the reports, as such any rules
or definitions quoted within the associated CCD ‘CS/SPE/011: NWB End to End
Reconciliation Reporting’, will take precedence.

3.1. NB101—- On Line Services Settlement Statement

This report provides settlement information based upon the “Client View’ where the
Data Reconciliation Service (DRS) has received C4 transaction components

1. C4 Settlement Date 1 — This figure identifies all C4 transaction components
received by the DRS with a ‘C4 Settlement Date’ = to the Run Date of the report.

2. C4 Settlement Date 2 — This figure identifies all C4 transaction components
received by the DRS with a ‘C4 Settlement Date’ = to the Run Date of the report
minus I day if any C4 transactions received for this date.

3. C4 Settlement Date 3 etc — This figure identifies all C4 transaction components
received by the DRS with a ‘C4 Settlement Date’ = to the Run Date of the report
minus 2 days if any C4 transactions received for this date. (Repeat for each day
where C4 transactions have been received)

4. Total of all C4 transactions received on this report.

5. Columns: Representing volume and value of Deposits, (titled ‘Receipts’) and
Withdrawals, (titled ‘Payments’).

6. Net Settlement column showing volume and value where:
e Volume = number of deposits plus number of withdrawals
e Value = value of deposits minus value of withdrawals

e Where the value of withdrawals exceeds the value of deposits, this total is
shown as (£9999.99)

NB: LINK transactions are reported via the LINK NB101 against their specific
financial institutions.

3.2. NB102 — Exception Summary
The report identifies all incomplete or exception states.
This report is divided into 12 sections:
Section 1: All Uncleared confirmed, unconfirmed and POLFS exceptions

e Reports exceptions by ‘Incomplete or Exception System State’ and reconciliation
date. Where no exceptions are reported for a particular system state, the row is
suppressed.

Section 2: Uncleared exceptioned client transactions

e Reports exceptions, (D), individually listed in system state order and reconciliation
date where the incomplete or exception state suggests an urgent resolution is
required to avoid customer dissatisfaction

Section 3: Uncleared corruption’s

e Reports DRS corruption’s individually listed in system state order and
reconciliation date.

Section 4: Uncleared timing differences

e Reports transaction components where there is a difference in the reconciliation
date and the posting date allocated where an ‘S’ has been received with an earlier
or later date than the ‘C4’. The ‘C4’ automatically assumes the ‘S’ reconciliation
date however the transaction is exceptioned. NB: For Alliance & Leicester,
CAPO, LINK & ETU transactions, this section is generally not expected to be
populated due to the exclusion of ‘S’ type transactions from this stream.

Section 5: Uncleared confirmed, unconfirmed and POLFS exceptions >24 hrs

e Reports defined uncleared exceptions (see CS/SPE/011) previously included within
Section I which have remained uncleared for a period of greater than 24 hours.
They are removed from section 1 and listed individually in system state and
reconciliation date order.

Section 6:  Uncleared future dated transactions by client

e Reports any transactions received by the DRS which are ‘future dated’ —
Settlement date > report run date +3 in system state and reconciliation date order.

Section 7: All Cleared confirmed, unconfirmed & TIP exceptions
e As section 1 — exceptions cleared and set to ‘F99’ by Fujitsu MSU
Section 8: Cleared exceptioned client transactions

e As section 2 — exceptions cleared and set to ‘F99’ by Fujitsu MSU
Section 9: Cleared corruption’s

If Fujitsu is unable to deliver any or all reports to the Post Office Ltd. / POLFS gateway by
08.00hrs the day following the run date of the report, Fujitsu MSU will liaise with POL
Finance to arrange an e-mail transmission via the Fujitsu corporate account. Fujitsu MSU will
operate this contingency under ‘reasonable endeavours’ and will aim to have the reports with
POL Finance by 09.00hrs in contingency. However this timescale may not be achievable if
processing problems have also delayed receipt of the reports into the DRS workstation.

NB: Should the Fujitsu corporate e-mail service unavailable, Fujitsu MSU will
liaise with POL Finance and agree facsimile of reports NB101 and NB102 section
Land 2.

Any distribution list for these reports is considered by both Fujitsu and Post Office Ltd to be
of a dynamic nature and therefore specific addressees are not covered within this document.

4.0 Reconciliation & Incident Handling

41 Incident Classification

4.1.1 On Line Services Business Incidents

Business Incidents relate to the ‘Symptom’ of an underlying cause — e.g. the effect of the
system fault on the resulting reconciliation or settlement information sent to Post Office Ltd.

An On Line Services Business Incident relates to one or more of the exceptions reported
within the On Line Services report set, or one or more reconciliation or settlement errors /
disputed transactions raised in accordance with this document by POL Finance. (Refer to
section 6.0 for a list of those On Line Services Business Incident incomplete or exception
states currently known and for which appropriate On Line Services Business Incident
reporting processes are set out in this document)

4.1.1.1 On Line Services Reconciliation Report Exceptions

Exceptions reported within the On Line Services Report Set will be applicable to:

e Communication difficulties between the Post Office branch and the Campus,
Agents, Correspondence servers, etc.

e Errors within the DRS (with corresponding errors returned via the TES)

e Errors causing TPS transactions not to be harvested

¢ Corruption’s within the DRS

4.1.2 On Line Services System Incidents
System Incidents relate to the underlying ‘Cause’

Following the creation of an On Line Services Business Incident, Fujitsu MSU may raise an
associated System Incident to identify and repair the underlying cause of an On Line Services

Business Incident. System Incidents will be routed to the appropriate group within Fujitsu, for
investigation and resolution.

Where there are associated System Incidents and On Line Services Business Incidents, their
relationship can be either:

© one to one; or
© one to many, respectively.

Depending on the severity and understanding of the system incident a problem may be
formally raised and the problem management route followed until the underlying cause can be
rectified.

42 Generation of Business Incidents

In line with the generic incident management Post Office Ltd. policy agreed between Fujitsu
and Post Office Ltd., On Line Services Business Incidents will only be recognised as such if
generated by POL Finance. as appropriate, via the Horizon Systems Helpdesk (HSD) or via
the ‘Enquiry Service’. This ensures that the On Line Services Business Incident is properly
logged, enabling Fujitsu MSU to ensure that corrective information can be supplied and any
underlying system fault can be rectified.

It is envisaged that On Line Services Business Incidents will only be generated by the
following groups within Fujitsu and Post Office Ltd.:

e Fujitsu MSU for all exceptions reported via the On Line Services report set

e POL Finance for any ‘Enquiry Based Banking Transactions’ (EBBT) or ‘Disputed
Transaction Notice’ (DBTN) discovered by Post Office Ltd. that has not been
reported by Fujitsu MSU via the On Line Services report set

e Fujitsu Third Line Support (SSC) for any system fault or database adjustment
which is considered by Fujitsu to have a reconciliation or settlement implication
within Post Office Ltd. in respect of On Line Services transactions.

Subject to agreement by the parties to the contrary, Post Office branch calls to the HSD will
not generate On Line Services Business Incidents. However calls from Post Office branches
will be monitored and if it is considered necessary by Fujitsu, difficulties reported to the HSD
will be elevated to On Line Services Business Incident status.

4.2.1 On Line Services Business Incidents Raised via the HSD by
Fujitsu/ MSU

Fujitsu MSU will raise an appropriate Business Incident when needed via the BIM data base
for all exceptions appearing on reconciliation report NB102 sections 2,3,4 and 5.

4.2.2 On Line Services EBBT Business Incidents Raised via the HSD by
POLPBA

It is important that POL Finance supply sufficient information to the HSD when generating
an On Line Services Business Incident in respect of an EBBT On Line Services Business
Incidents to ensure the timescales for the resolution of On Line Services Business Incidents
referred to in section 4.4 can be achieved. Achievement of such timescales is dependent upon
the following information being provided by POL Finance when generating an On Line
Services Business Incident via the HSD:

1. A valid ‘PATH’ code must be quoted, e.g. ‘PATH040’ etc.

4.4.1.

43 On Line Services Incident Reporting

4.3.1 BIM Reports / MER

The Business Incident Management System (BIMS) has been designed to report the progress
to resolution of an On Line Services Business Incident to allow Post Office Ltd. to complete
an accurate reconciliation or settlement with their clients. For ease of identification and
association with the corresponding HSD call, BIM report references will mimic the HSD
reference, or where no HSD input is needed the BIM report will use the Fujitsu fault logging
(PEAK) reference. Where an incident has been raised via the Enquiry Service, an initial
response will be provided via telephone to POL Finance and followed up by an appropriate
BIM report using the PEAK reference.

In all cases each BIM report will have a unique identifier.

43.1.1 I Format & content of BIM report / MER

A BIM report will be issued for each On Line Services Business Incident generated via the
HSD and the Enquiry Service. As part of that BIM report, Fujitsu MSU will issue a MER for
each error associated with the relevant On Line Services Business Incident where it is
necessary to do so, to advise POL Finance of the transaction detail required to enable
reconciliation or settlement to take place

BIM reports / MER are designed to notify POL Finance of the detail required to assist in the
reconciliation or settlement process within Post Office Ltd. domain. BIM_ reports
communicate information concerning the resolution of the symptom of an underlying cause,
not the cause itself. BIM reports / MER will not advise any detail as to the underlying ‘Cause’
of the problem if this is a result of a software error etc. This information is supplied via the
Problem Management route (if escalated to this level).

Where a System Incident is generated to eradicate the cause of a particular problem and there
are one or more associated On Line Services Business Incidents, cross-references will be
supplied on the On Line Services Business Incident BIM report / MER and via the Problem
Management process to allow tracking of the System Incident.

43.1.2 Clearance Criteria

Fujitsu MSU anticipates that it will provide information concerning On Line Services Business
Incidents to POL Finance on a “drip feed’ basis, by issuing updated versions of the initial BIM
report / MER.

e A BIM report is ‘Cleared’ when Fujitsu MSU has provided the reconciliation /
settlement information required to be contained in the relevant BIM report as set

out in section 4.4.1.1. Additionally, the exception is cleared from the appropriate
section of NB102 by Fujitsu MSU.

POL Finance will advise Fujitsu MSU via spreadsheet on a monthly basis of any payments it
considers are payable to Post Office Ltd (as compensation for Post Office Ltd. costs in dealing
with MER). For the avoidance of doubt, NO charges are payable in respect of MER
issued for On Line Services incidents not affecting the POLFS transaction stream.

If the parties disagree whether the POLFS transaction stream has been affected or not, or
consequential loss has been incurred by Post Office Ltd and after discussion no agreement can
be reached the specific incidents will then be escalated via a ‘Case Law Referral’ form, to the
Commercial Forum for a final decision to be made.

4.3.1.3 BIM Report Distribution

Fujitsu MSU will distribute On Line Services BIM reports / MER to POL Finance. using the
Fujitsu corporate e-mail network. In the event that this facility is temporarily unavailable,
reports will be distributed via mutually agreed methods (CD/Floppy etc).

BIM reports / MER distributed in accordance with this section will be deemed to have been
issued to POL Finance. at the time of transmission by mail.

An example of a BIM report / MER is shown in Section 5.0.

44 On Line Services Exception Resolution Timescales

incomplete, BIM report will serve to notify POL Finance that an On Line Services Business
Incident has occurred and that the completed BIM report will be provided to POL Finance.

4.4.1.1 SLT Exclusion / Suspension Criteria

e Where an exception has been generated due to factors outside of Fujitsu control,
e.g. where a Post Office branch has failed to communicate due to fire, flooding or
other agreed ‘Force Majeur’ conditions, the exception will be removed from the
BIM SLT calculation in agreement with Post Office Ltd and resolved using
‘Reasonable Endeavours’.

e Where an exception necessitates the retrieval of information from, or access to, a
Post Office branch to enable successful resolution and this is not available. The
period whilst Fujitsu waits, having requested that information or access be
provided, shall not count towards the time for resolution of that exception.

Post Office Ltd. will be informed via the BIM report applicable to the exception being
investigated that SLT suspension is being invoked in respect of the above.

4.4.1.2 On Line Services System Incident Resolution Timescales

requirement and would aim to deliver an initial analysis of the root cause within 5 working
days and a final analysis and evidence of remedial action, within 10 working days. A System
