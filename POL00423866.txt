Hi all

Please find attached letter that has been sent to Paula Vennells. We have also received an emailed copy and previously
this Postmaster contacted POL via our ‘One’ medium.

Apologies for the wide circulation but I would really appreciate some guidance on this one given the content of the
letter with multiple issues raised although mainly centred on Horizon/Legacy issues. As this is a local it’s supported by
BSST so no direct visit — do you think in the circumstances contact from a Senior Manager in POL would be appropriate

and possibly appreciated by this Postmaster who clearly wants to make a success of his venture but feels he has had
little support from POL — please advise.

Please reply to

Janet
