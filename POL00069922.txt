Dear Greg

Post Office Limited -v- Mr L Castleton

I refer to our recent telephone discussion.

I enclose a Bundle of papers that I received yesterday from Mr Castleton, for your attention. You will see
that they include the Witness Statements of Christine Train, Dorothy Day and Lee Castleton, Please can I

ask you to review them and provide me with your comments. In particular:

1. In paragraph 31 of Christine Train’s Witness Statement, she states that you alienated customers. Is
this correct?

2. In paragraph 32 of Christine Train’s Witness Statement she states that whilst you were temporary
Sub-Master, Mrs Oglesby visited the office and took all of the paperwork covering the period of the
mis-balances. Can you remember whether this is correct and if so, what it was that Mrs Oglesby took?

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
Kind regards.

Yours sincerely

Stephen Dilley
