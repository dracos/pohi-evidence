EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF IMPACT ASSESSMENTS:

SPoC 2 is the second phase to support PO Ltd’s business vision of a single point of
contact for the outlets building on SPoC phase 1 which was implemented in
September 2001.

This CCN introduces the change to the current process of receiving helpdesk calls
both by the HSH and NBSC. There is no technical change envisaged by the
introduction of SPoC 2.

OVERALL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: HIGH HMEDIUM+LOW

REASON FOR CHANGE:

“SPoC 2” is the second phase as specified below, to support PO Ltd’s business
vision of a single point of contact for the outlets building on SPoC phase 1 which
was implemented in September 2001.

It is PO Ltd’s aim to reduce the need to transfer calls from outlets between two
support centres when they have a problem that requires a business and or
operational answer. It is intended that the move to SPoC 2 should reduce call time
and provide the Outlet with a more integrated help desk service.

DETAILS OF CHANGE:

Currently the NBSC resolves Post Office business related calls and the HSH
resolves calls surrounding the operation of the Horizon counter kit and calls relating
to hardware, software and network problems.

The Introduction of SPoC 2 would result in the HSH only resolving hardware,
software, and network problems for example “my printer has broken”, together with
any environmental and security issues. The NBSC would then resolve any calls
where outlets require advice or guidance in using the Horizon system, for example
“how do I input a bureau transaction to the system”. These calls are currently

FUJ00000875
FUJ00000875

categorised as Advice & Guidance, cash accounting or training.
* When placing a call, the outlet will be directed by the telephony (IVR), which

is in PO Ltd’s domain.

All advice and guidance type calls received at any time by HSH will be

referred to the NBSC and logged as “inappropriate” by the HSH.

The HSH will only provide technical support on system issues.

Existing resource shall be maintained by the HSH until 1°‘ January 2003.

The proposed change impacts the CSR+ HSH PPD (CS/PRO/092) v4.0 and Fujitsu
Services Pathway/Post Office Limited Interface Agreement for the Network Business
Support Centre and Horizon System Helpdesk (CS/IFS/007) v3.0 both these
documents will be amended/updated to describe the introduction of SPoC 2.

Any effect on charges under the Codified Agreement as a result of the
implementation of this CCN has been considered as part of the joint Working
Together program and has been included within the Proposal to Post Office Ltd for
Extension of the Horizon Contract dated 18'" September 2002 (Contract
Amendment). Should Post Office Ltd decide not to proceed with the proposal for
Contract Amendment then the parties will enter into further discussions in good faith
to agree an appropriate reduction in charges payable under the Codified Agreement
and taking into account the price for implementing this CCN.

PROPOSED REVISION TO WORDING OF CODIFIED AGREEMENT:

Refer to Attachment 1 of this CCN.

CCB Minutes (237) 30-Oct-02
CCN PENDING

Presented by Change Management and P Purewal after the CCN had been updated to reflect the rejection
points against CCN 1016 and discussions held between Directors and the commercial department. The main
points of discussion being the inclusion of a figure for RATEX within the CCN, and the reintroduction of L1
and L2 SLAs into the CCN attachment. M Riddell confirmed that this reintroduction did not raise the price of
the CCN.

M Riddell then confirmed that there was no RATES specific to SpoC 2 and as such the paragraph detailing
this should be removed.

B Carter questioned the inclusion of the statement regarding "an appropriate reduction in charges payable",
the Board believed that this statement should remain and would be resolved in further discussions on Contract
Renegotiations.

B Carter suggested that there be a timeline added for the invoicing of the CCN charges, similar to Debit Card -
the CCB requested that this be the case.

Discussion ensued on whether a statement on the intention of retaining staff to year-end is included, and it was
agreed that a statement should be added.

Change Management queried what approval timescale was required for the CCN and R Brunskill agreed to
confirm this with his PO contact.

CCB agreed CCN should be submitted subject to actions.

Actions:

1) P Purewal/R Brunskill to amend CCN to remove reference to RATEX, include timeline for invoicing and to
include statement about staff retention

2) R Brunskill to confirm with Post Office when approval should be requested to allow the necessary lead-
times for implementation.

3) Change Management to amend CCN in system and submit on identified Fast Track approval once actions 1
and 2 completed.
