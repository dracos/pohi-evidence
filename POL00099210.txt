Annex 1

Board Effectiveness Review

1. Process

The Chairman interviewed all the Board Directors and the Company Secretary on a one-to-
one basis using the Discussion Guidelines, attached at Annex 2, between 20 June and 3
July. A list of interviewees is at Annex 3. The Chief Executive had consulted her ExCo
colleagues and included their views in her feedback.

This report summarises all the points made. There were many common themes and where
the same points were made more than once, they have not been repeated. All the
suggestions made for improving how the Board works are included and brought together in
section 13.

The process included peer feedback for all members of the Board which the Chairman will
communicate separately on an individual basis. Concurrently, the SID has conducted a peer
review of the Chairman's performance which is being fed back separately to her.

The Board will discuss this report at its July meeting and it will then be sent to the
Shareholder Executive.

2. Context

Alice Perkins took over the Chairmanship of the Post Office Board from Donald Brydon in
October 2011. At that time the CEO, CFO, SID and Company Secretary were all in their
present roles. The other NEDs joined the Board over the period from [March] to September
2012. So at the time of carrying out this evaluation, the Board has been in existence for less
than a year. It is early days in its life.

3. Headline Comments

The creation of a new PO Board has gone remarkably well in a very difficult context and
challenging environment. The Board is maturing. It has come a long way since autumn 2011
and is operating very well (8 out of 10). We can be pleased with where it has got to and the
Shareholder should be pretty pleased. The issue now is how to make it even better.

This is a well-functioning Board. The Directors have a wide range of skills and experience
from different backgrounds. We have the key bases covered. We are working together
effectively; it’s fun and really challenging.

This is a disparate set of Directors who have come together and are pointing in the same
direction most of the time; there is a sense of team work. We do listen to each other and can
agree to disagree or agree on what we are prepared to live with. It can feel uneven as
between the respective contributions of the Executives and the NEDs.

The Board has got better as it has matured. People have become feistier; they are
challenging but very respectful of each other and of the business. Board members come well
prepared; they are good at listening. They don’t always agree and sometimes issues get re-
opened when people thought they had been settled. The debate can be circular and hard to
close down but it is helpful if people speak up if they disagree.

The Board is quite different from a year ago. It is stimulating, vibrant, pro-active and
searching for solutions in its determination to fix the business. It is extremely positive and
helping the Executives to improve. It adds value.
POL00099210

POL00099210

Annex 1

The Board provides a good balance between support and challenge — it is giving clear
direction and has a clear mandate and has stopped diving into the detail. It feels like a team
which is great. ExCo feels very positive about it - should they and the Board meet a couple
of times a year?

The Board has been the most amazing improvement for the PO. The recruitment of the
NEDs has gone really well — they have very different skills and have the ability to
contemplate working in a different environment from what they are used to. The company
has adjusted well to the new Board. Thank goodness we went in that direction.

4. Organisation of the Board

Overall, this is very good. The Company Secretary, supported by Jorja Preston, provides
excellent support to the Board including looking after the hygiene factors, really well. The
electronic papers are great and one Director commented positively on the Reading Room
while another wondered whether it is as useful as it could be?

The meetings are held at the right frequency, for the right length of time and they run to time.
The quality of the papers has improved but there is further to go — some should be crisper
and they should always arrive in time for Board members to digest them properly before
meetings unless there is an emergency to report.

A common theme was that the Board could use its time even better. There is still a tendency
for Executives to repeat what is in the papers. The Board could get better at taking papers
as read if there are no issues to discuss. For instance, while retaining a paper on financial
performance and key indicators at each Board meeting, should the Board discuss this at
alternate meetings and without any introduction from the CFO unless it is to add something
new? This would release time which could be spent on the substance of the business such
as mails and financial services.

Several people commented on the nature of the debate. The Board does not need to be led
by the Executives to a conclusion - this is not a good use of the Directors’ expertise. It is
getting better at having a robust debate. One person commented that it is a very respectful
Board and another Director suggested that it should become more hard-edged and willing to
call a spade.

The Board is not a talking shop. It takes decisions all the time but the Chairman could be
even clearer about when decisions have been made and they could be recorded in a
decision log at the end of the minutes. This should flush out outstanding differences and the
Board would be able to decide explicitly how to handle these rather than finding that the
issues were being unexpectedly re-opened by one member of the Board to the surprise of
the others.

Should the Board make more use of the NEDs in creative ways so that they are generating
ideas rather than reviewing ideas which have come up from the Executives? (e.g. the
session on Outsourcing at the recent Awayday.)

The recent Awayday had been good (though the session on Mails had been a wasted
opportunity). How many of these should there be in a year (in the last year there have been
two — Shoreditch and Kingston)?

Should the Board meet outside Head Office more often e.g. at a large Crown or a call
centre?
POL00099210

POL00099210

Annex 1

Should the Board meet the ExCo on a regular (but infrequent) basis? And what about the
SLT?

Should the Board have a dinner with partners?

One Director asked that dates for future Board meetings in 2014 and even 2015 should be
fixed now.

It was also suggested that the Board should have a regular opportunity to review the forward
programme of agendas as it has in the past.

There is sometimes an absence of follow-through (e.g. the delay in circulating the updated
Rothschild’s work). While this has got better, there is further to go.

5. Committee Organ n

The right Committees are in place. The Board has only just set these up so their roles should
be clear and they are.

The Committees have been feeling their way on the frequency and timing of their meetings.
There is a need to find a schedule which works and is more settled. This is especially true of
the ARC and the RemCom.

The RemCom is the Committee with the most difficult business in practice and it has not
always felt as though it is in control of it. This should improve with experience of the
interaction with the Shareholder, better forward planning and better professional support
from the business.

The ARC initially felt too much like the main Board but that is better now that membership
has been reduced to three NEDs. It is discharging its responsibilities properly and has
handled the two year-ends extremely well. One Director commented that it might be trying to
do too much and might need to be more flexible in its use of time. There is important and
urgent work for it to do on risk, which is in hand for the autumn. Several Directors
commented that that it was the next major priority after settling the strategy.

The Mutualisation Committee has been less effective than the Board although it has the
same membership. It should review its future programme in the light of the strategy.

6. Strategy

The Board has spent a great deal of time on the Strategy since it has been fully formed and
this has been helpful in terms of its understanding of the business and its development as a
team.

The Directors all think the Strategy has been well developed and are happy with the
substance of what they have agreed. At the time of writing, this is subject to negotiations
with the Shareholder.

However, the process got off to a shaky start at Shoreditch. Lessons were learned from that
and by the end the NEDs all felt satisfied that they had been able to make the contribution
they wanted to make. There was universal recognition that Sue Barton’s role in this had
been invaluable.

One Director commented that there was further to go in articulating the vision of what the
Post Office would be in 2020.
POL00099210
POL00099210

Annex 1

7. Board Composition

There is universal agreement that the Board has a great mixture of skills and experience.
Almost all the key aspects of the business are covered and several people commented that
whatever came up as an issue, there would be at least one member of the Board who had
the relevant experience to make a valuable contribution to its resolution. The areas where
additional expertise would be valuable were large-scale operations including change
management, industrial relations and IT.

Some people also commented on the mix of Directors in terms of their styles and
temperaments. There is a good balance between the entrepreneurial and the risk conscious
and between those whose glasses are half full and those whose are half empty. It would be
important in future to ensure that any changes in the Board did not result in the balance
being skewed too far one way or the other.

The Board is well balanced in terms of gender. In future it would be good if there were also a
greater diversity of ethnicity.

8. Board Involvement

The Directors’ knowledge of the business was generally thought to be sufficient for their
roles, though individual Directors raised areas which they it would be helpful for them to
understand better e.g. the economics of the network including SPMs’ pay.

There had been a tendency in the early days for NEDs to appear to “meddle” in the business
and dive down too much into the detail but this had diminished over time. This needs
watching as it is always tempting for NEDs to fall into that trap on any Board.

All the NEDs commented on how willing the Executives were to engage with them outside
Board meetings and were impressed by the extent to which most of them, and especially the
CEO, were open to challenge. In return, the Executives commented that the NEDs were very
generous with their time outside the Boardroom.

The relationship between the Chairman and the CEO appeared good, supportive but also
challenging with no obvious tensions.

One NED wondered whether they should become more involved by e.g. opening new PO

branches and/or developing relationships with key stakeholders (see next section). The CEO
wondered whether they could contribute to interviewing key candidates for ExCo positions.

9. Board Relationships with Key Stakeholders

There is general recognition that there is more to do here. The Board needs to understand
its shareholder's position better, especially that of the Minister concerned. The session with
Mark Russell had been extremely useful (“formative’/” an eye-opener’) in that context. It was
excellent that he had agreed to come again in the autumn and there should be more
sessions to help the Board understand this area.

It is also recognised that more time should be spent forging relationships with other key
stakeholders inside and outside the business. The Forum at the recent Awayday had been a
good use of time.
POL00099210
POL00099210

Annex 1

10. Risk, Compliance, Financial Moni ig.

The Directors believe that they are carrying out their fiduciary duties appropriately overall.
Several people commented on the need to do more work on risk management as noted
above. More than one NED commented that the financial and performance report could be
improved further. Is there sufficiently robust reporting of the delivery of key projects,
including cost-cutting — is there a danger of the Board being lulled into a false sense of
security over these?

There is also a need to satisfy the Board that the right compliance measures are in place in
financial services as the company expands its business in this area. This is something for
the ARC in the first instance; there is a need to spend more time on this.

11. Looking Forward

Directors are concerned about the quality of the pipeline for the top posts, especially for the
CEO’s position. This is something which has already been identified and work is underway
under the direction of the NomCo to address it. Progress is being made in relation to the
ExCo positions and job specifications for new recruits to the ExCo are targeted at candidates
with the potential to be future CEOs. This is a real weakness which NomCo and the Board
need to keep actively under review.

The induction of the NEDs had been done well and everyone was satisfied with this. The
Board needed to decide now what additional development was needed, for example, visits to
branches (should each NED commit to visit a certain number every year?) or
workshops/Board sessions on particular issues?

It will be important to manage the tenure of the NEDs so that there is no bunching of
retirements.

12. Overall Board Effectiveness

The Directors thought that the Board got the balance right between fulfilling its fiduciary
duties and making a positive, substantive contribution to the business. Looking back over the
last year, one Director commented that the Board’s agenda had felt as though it had lurched
in an unplanned way but that once the Strategy was settled, it should be possible to get
more stability into the business and focus on key elements of its delivery.

The right balance has been struck between support and challenge. But the Board has now
“formed”. It has been “quite kind” to the business. It can now be more challenging and
expect more; it needs to be more demanding e.g. about cost-cutting, and tougher with
failure.

Generally the Directors were satisfied with the quality of the external advice received e.g.

the auditors, and Rothschild’s, but one Director commented that the business did not always
seem to be clear about what it was using advisers for, or doing that well.

13. Areas for Discussion and Action

POL00099210

POL00099210

Annex 1

Discussion

What is the right balance amount of rigour and challenge? Does the Board agree that it
should be more forthright than it is now? How would that affect the balance between the
NEDs and the Executives?

Does the Board agree that time should be saved in meetings by moving more briskly through
agenda items and discussing financial performance and key indicators only every other
meeting (assuming things are on track?) If so, what would it like to spend more time on? Is
giving more time to our key stakeholders, including understanding the Shareholder better, a
key priority?

How could the NEDs be used more creatively?

What does the Board want to do outside Board meetings e.g. branch visits (an annual target
for NEDs?), workshops, meetings with key stakeholders, or with ExCo/SLT?

Are two Awaydays a year right?
Would the Board like a dinner with partners?

Should the Board meet outside Head Office more frequently e.g. at large Crowns or call
centres?

Is the Reading Room as useful as it could be?
Action

The Chairman to sum up discussions even more clearly. Board members to speak up if they
disagree or register clearly that they are willing to support the majority view despite
remaining reservations.

Executives to assume as a matter of course, that their papers have been read and not to
repeat material already covered unless asked to do so. The Chairman to move more swiftly
through each item unless there are questions or issued raised by the Board.

Company Secretary to fix Board dates for 2014 and if possible, 2015; to record decisions
taken in a “log” at the end of the minutes of each meeting; to continue to work with the
Executives to raise the standard of papers and ensure they are sent out in good time; to
ensure all follow-up action is taken timeously and circulate a forward programme of Board
agendas every 6 months.

All Committees to keep the cycle of their meetings under review and follow-up on the key

issues identified in this report e.g. succession planning for NomCo and risk for ARC.

Innovation: Our future business capabilities will be underpinned by
innovative delivery of a multi-channel retailing experience.

Over the past year we have worked with innovative SME’s (working
in the Government space) to specify the technology required to
integrate existing and future systems.

Our proposed platform (CDP: Common Digital Platform) is
grounded in non-proprietary hardware and software avoiding
excessive lock-in and licence costs.

Our Common Digital Platform utilises commodity services including
for example, cloud computing and open source software platforms
to support speed to market and value for money.

Our platform is being designed to scale with business demand,
allowing us to flex services as necessary.

We are currently in the process of proving this platform prior to
establishing it more widely in all future developments, including
delivery of services to the branch counter.

Our initial proof of concept (Environment Agency “Rod Fishing
Licence”) has been developed in weeks rather than months.

Our approach is enabling us to avoid supplier lock-in, significant
licence costs and increase our business responsiveness.

Branch Counter: Fujtisu is currently Post Office’s largest technology
partner providing critical services including our branch counter service

(Horizon).

Branch Counter Systems (Horizon)
. Horizon is a bespoke solution operating out of resilient data centres in | Contractual Context |

Northern Ireland.

° Our plan is to migrate Horizon to our new IT supply chain over the
strategic term.

. Horizon was originally created in 1995 in partnership between the then
DSS7, Post Office and ICL2.

. The system is in all our c.11,800 Post Office’s nationwide, operating
some c.30,000 counter positions.

. The service has not been tendered under public procurement law since
that time.

Delivering our 2020 vision:

. It is prudent in selecting a way forward to recognise the significant
investment Post Office have already made in Horizon over its lifetime.

. Early in 2013 we identified a number of routes forward.

. All options are dependant upon public procurement law and
negotiations with Fujitsu

. We are undertaking further work this financial year to establish the
requirements for and market test our options for continued channel
services post 315t March 2015..

.

The contract under which services are provided is
known as HNG-x

HNG-x contract ends 31st March 2015.

The branch counter service known as Horizon is
the most significant service provided under the
HNG-x contract.

Arange of services are provided through the
HNG-x contract including:

- Horizon, our Branch Counter system

- Core Finance (SAP)

- Management Information (Credence)

Contract value to Fujitsu circa £65m pa plus BAU
change.

There is no automatic extension capability written
into the contract.

We are required by Public Procurement Law to
offer the services to the market.

. Our precise path forward will not become clear until this work comes to
fruition.

Managing Legacy (Horizon): In considering how we continue to provide .
Post Office branch counter services we have established the following
principles and path forward.
Principles
In considering how we continue to provide branch counter services we must take
account of a number of key requirements including:
. De-risking the network and crown transformation programmes.
. The Horizon transitional support services are designed to guarantee business
stability while the Post Office implements a modern, fit for purpose Point of Service
solution.
. The services provided under this agreement will amongst others include:
- Branch communications data network
- Data centre hosting in Fujitsu’s Belfast data centre.
- Horizon application support.
Moving forward
The major tenets comprising our future plans require us to:
. Conclude commercial negotiations with Fujitsu to agree on a 2 year Transitional
support service.
. Begin procurement for our future POS solution.
. Commence procurement for our Network Tower. This tower will assume
responsibility for the provision of the branch communications network at March
2017.

IT&C Transformation Programme
Service Integrator and Data Centre Procurement Update

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

1.4 Update the Board on the current status of the procurements for a Service
Integrator and a strategic Data Centre.

1.2 Inform the Board that a request for approval to award both contracts is expected
to be presented to the Executive Committee and Post Office Board in September
2013. The Service Integrator award will also need approval from the Shareholder
Executive

2. Background

21 As previously agreed by the Executive Committee and the Board, Post Office is
re-procuring its IT supply chain to meet the demands of our business strategy,
Royal Mail Group Separation activities and support our end of life IT contracts.

2.2 As we progress our IT supply chain we will be asking for approval to award
contracts to our selected bidders. Due to the size of award, Post Office financial
governance requires some of these approvals to be sought from the Board and
Shareholder Executive.

2.3 The Service Integrator and Data Centre procurements will be the first contract
awards. We will be presenting these to the Executive Committee and the Post
Office Board in September for approval.

24 We are currently refreshing the business case for IT supply chain procurement
and this will be presented to POLIC in July.

Service Integrator and Service Desk (SISD).

3. Overview

3.1 Given the volume of change required to support our IT and business
transformation journey the Post Office needs a trusted partner.

3.2 The Service Integrator, which will encompass our IT Service Desk, will fulfil this
role and is pivotal to the success of our new IT supply chain.

3.3 The SISD will be the single point of contact for Post Office colleagues on all
aspects of Information Technology (IT).

3.4 They will be accountable for the end-to-end management and delivery of current
and future IT services.

“Service Integrator and Data Lesley Sewell Page 1 of 4
Centre Procurement Update” 9" July 2013
POL00099210
POL00099210

Post Office Ltd — Strictly Confidential
3.5 The key aims of this procurement are to optimise the IT supply chain to:

e Reduce operating costs.

e Improve Post Office speed to market for business and product change.
e Offer an improved user experience.

e Drive innovation in process, service and cost management.

e Improve our identification and management of technology risks.

e Improve our ability to benchmark our services against the market to ensure

continued value for money over the life of the Tower contracts.

3.6 Our new IT Operating Model balances the responsibilities between the Post
Office and the SISD, with Post Office retaining the commercial relationships
while the SISD takes accountability for delivery.

37 Following contract award a number of current Post Office staff will move to work
for the Service Integrator (under TUPE).

3.8 The key challenge that we face is establishing the new contractual relationships
within a short period of time. The sequencing and alignment of contract awards
is crucial to our success.

4. Current Status
44 We are following a Competitive Dialogue procurement process’.

4.2 We have completed an extensive period of dialogue with 3 suppliers (CGI, Cap
Gemini and ATOS) to clearly define the Post Office’s current, transition and
future operating models.

4.3 A formal Invitation to Submit Final Tender (ISFTY, which defines Post Office’s
requirements to the bidders, has been approved by the programme board and
issued. Issuing an ISFT enables the three suppliers to submit a bid detailing their
final contractual and commercial terms.

44 Submitted bids will be evaluated on cost and the quality to which they meet the
defined requirements, resulting in the selection of a preferred supplier in August.

45 Approval will be sought from the Executive Committee and Post Office Board in
September for contract award.

* Competitive Dialogue is a Public Procurement Law (PPL) procedure used where there is a need to develop
solutions and requirements with assistance from the market.

? The ISFT does not commit us to contract, but does form the basis of the contract. PPL procedure prevents any
negotiation or changes to contractual or commercial terms following issue of an ISFT.

5. Commercial Terms

5.1 The contract is being offered on an initial term? of 4 years with an option to
extend for up to 2 years at Post Office’s discretion.

5.2 This contract is shorter than the initial term for other Tower contracts. This is to
facilitate early re-procurement of the Service Integrator as they will then assist
Post Office in selection for future Tower providers.

5.3 Based on dialogue, the cost estimates are in the range of £10m to £12m per
annum, £40 to £48m over the initial term. Cost estimates will be refined during
the evaluation of ISFT responses.

5.4 These costs are in line with industry benchmarks for the services we are looking
to procure.

Data Centre.
6. Overview

6.1 Data Centres provide the facility to host and operate the IT systems required to
support the Post Office.

6.2 Post Office currently has multiple Data Centres including some services provided
by Royal Mail. Many of these Data Centres are reaching end of life.

6.3 Procuring a strategic Data Centre will allow us to consolidate our current data
centres which will lead to a reduced cost base. In addition we will have access
to technologies, such as Cloud’, which will enable us to adjust our costs in line
with varying business demand.

6.4 Our strategy is to consolidate our Data Centres into one operational facility
supported by a resilient backup.

7. Current Status
7A We are currently in the final stages of dialogue with Fujitsu.

7.2 Dialogue will complete during August and subject to its successful conclusion we
will recommend the contract award to the Board in September.

8. Commercial Terms

8.1 The contract is being offered on an initial term? of 5 years with an option to
extend for up to 2 years at Post Office’s discretion.

8.2 Based on dialogue the cost estimates are in the range of £3m to £4m per
annum, £15 to £20m over the initial term®. Cost estimates will be refined during
the evaluation of the ISFT response.

° The term was defined in the initial OJEU (Official Journal of the European Union) notice and cannot be changed
without restarting the procurement process.

* Cloud: enables Post Office to reduce its overheads by using shared third party IT facilities.

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD
Transitional Support Services with Fujitsu
1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

1.1 Seek approval from the Board for a 2-year agreement’ with Fujitsu for Transitional
Support Services (TSS), so ensuring continued provision of Horizon? counter services.

1.2 Gain approval to submit this paper to the Shareholder Executive in July 2013 for
approval to sign the TSS agreement before the 30" September 2013.

2. Our journey so far

2.1 Fujitsu has developed and run Horizon for the Post Office since 1995. Itis a highly
complex, bespoke system which given its structure is inflexible and costly to change.

2.2 During the last 12 months, we have initiated the following programmes of work to
enhance Horizon and better support our business strategy. These include:

¢ Horizon Anywhere: allows Horizon to run on any Microsoft Windows device.

¢ Branch Counter Refresh: identifies how we replace out dated counter hardware to
enable new services such as internet and email.

¢ Horizon Business Services: reduces the cost and time for Post Office to connect
business partners and clients to Horizon.

2.3 In parallel we have conducted market activity to understand how other Postal
organisations have transitioned away from their legacy Point of Service (POS) solutions.

2.4 Having completed this activity we now better understand the challenge and time
requirements to deliver a future POS solution for an organisation of our size and
complexity.

3. Recommendations

3.1 Extend the existing Fujitsu contract for Horizon via a 2-year TSS agreement to:

« Secure the continued provision of core Horizon services to 31" March 2017 so
allowing time to procure a future POS solution which will either evolve or replace
Horizon.

¢ Acquire a Horizon Intellectual Property (IP)° license from Fujitsu so that any new
suppliers have the choice to incorporate elements of this solution within their
proposal.

¢ Allow time to deconstruct and transition Horizon services into the new IT supply chain
(Towers model).

1 The Transitional Support Services agreement is a contract change note, or CCN, which varies the existing Horizon contract.

2 Horizon Online electronic counter services are provided by Fujitsu Services under the HNGx managed services contract which
provides end-to-end services to all Post Office branches. The Agreement was originally signed 28" July 1999 and has been
extended. It expires on 34 March 2015.

3 Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).

Post Office Ltd — Strictly Confidential

4. Considerations

4.1 Horizon costs c £68M inclusive of VAT each year, comprising OpEx of c £58M and
development business as usual CapEx of c £10M. This expenditure represents
approximately 70% of third party IT OpEx spend.

4.2 Given the business criticality of Horizon, a risk constrained approach to any
transformation impacting counter services is essential.

4.3 The HNGx contract with Fujitsu includes a provision for Post Office to request an
extension beyond 31*' March 2015. Unless otherwise agreed, formal notification must
be provided to Fujitsu by 30" September 2013.

5. Transitional Support Services (TSS) Benefits

5.1 Post Office branch counter operations are protected during the 2-year TSS period,
reducing our risk profile during Crown and Network transformation and separation from

Royal Mail Group.

5.2 Post Office price points have been maintained and in some cases improved whilst the
scope’ with Fujitsu has been reduced.

5.3 Horizon services will be transitioned to the Towers model during the TSS period and
additional partial termination rights° have been negotiated with Fujitsu to support this
approach.

5.4 Inclusion of additional transition and collaboration principles will allow Post Office to
leverage the benefits of its Service Integrator to manage this activity.

5.5 Post Office will have sufficient time to implement our future POS solution, engaging with
the market to ensure an effective competitive process.

6. Risks

6.1 Should transition to our future POS solution extend beyond 31° March 2017, Fujitsu
have indicated that additional investment in the Horizon data centre will be required. As
a result of this we have already begun the process of determining our future POS
solution and preparing to go to market.

6.2 Horizon is a complex solution comprising multiple services that are currently provided by
Fujitsu. Any transition of these services adds additional risk. A 2-year TSS has
therefore been selected as affording the best balance between risk and cost.

6.3 There is a risk that we may be unable to agree an IP License with Fujitsu on reasonable
terms. Post Office is continuing to meet with Fujitsu and the Board will be updated as
discussions develop.

7. Financials

7.1 OpEx for the proposed TSS agreement is up to £41.5M inclusive of VAT per annum.
This does not represent incremental expenditure beyond the on-going cost of
maintaining our Branch counter service.

Some Horizon services will transition to Towers during FY2014~15 including Service Desk and Engineering Services.
Post Office can partially terminate for convenience many individual Horizon services. Alternatively, the whole Agreement
can be terminated prior to full term. Any early termination is subject to early termination charges.

POL00099210
POL00099210

Post Office Ltd — Strictly Confidential

7.2 At the point of signature, Post Office’s liability to early termination charges is increased
by c £8.3M. This incremental liability reduces during the term of the TSS agreement.

7.3 As we conclude the Tower procurements, we will progressively plan transition of TSS
services to the Towers model to optimise our OpEx position.

8. Approval Request

8.1 The Board is requested to approve a 2-year Transitional Support Services Agreement
with Fujitsu valued at up to £83M.

8.2 The Board is asked to note that approval for authority to contract the TSS agreement
with Fujitsu will also need to be sought from the Shareholder Executive in July. This will
allow us to conclude negotiations and execute the TSS with Fujitsu before the 30”

September 2013.

Financial Services Strategy Update

Background

1.1

1.2

14

At the March 2013 meeting the Board supported the Financial Services (FS)
strategy (the Plan) and asked management to provide an update on progress,
in particular that the assumptions on the new insurance model remained valid.

The Plan identified the opportunity for the Post Office to become the leading
challenger FS brand, with five million customers and gross income of £530
million by 2020. The Plan also confirmed that to deliver the growth, the Post
Office needs to enhance its business fundamentally, in particular to:

e Build the brand, so that customers are aware of the Post Office FS offer;
e Ensure our products are simple, transparent and offer value for money;
« Improve the sales model and people capability;

« Enhance the sales and service experience for customers, including
leveraging branch and on-line capabilities’.

The Plan also highlighted the opportunity to change the role that Post Office
plays in insurance, taking more value from the transaction. The initial focus for
this strategy was on the travel insurance business as the current
arrangements expire shortly; subsequent phases encompassed acquiring the
Bank of Ireland (UK) plc’s (Bol) interest in insurance and taking over the
broking activities currently performed by Junction/BSL.

This paper provides an update on progress on the core components of the
strategy after three months and is tabled for noting.

Travel insurance

21

2.2

23

To provide customers with travel insurance, Post Office currently utilises a
single underwriter (Ageas) via a broker (Aon). This structure is cumbersome,
expensive and slow to market and is not capable of delivering the 2020 vision.
Establishing a new model for travel insurance requires:

* Confirming the proposed model to establish an MGA? (see 2.3 - 2.5);

« Extending the existing travel insurance arrangements (2.6);

e Identifying and procuring an appropriate insurance platform (2.7);

e Assessing the future operating model for the Aon call centre (2.8 - 2.9).
Since March, management has been stress-testing the proposed model and

engaged Miller Insurance Service LLP, its corporate insurance adviser, to
review the model and validate the assumptions’.

This change program is largely funded from the £4.0 million annual investment commitment that
Post Office made in Eagle. This does not include Post Office brand investment, or acquiring the
insurance businesses. Bol provides £15 million per annum in marketing spend.

The MGA would control the process of the insurance delivery, giving Post Office significant
operational and commercial flexibility.

Including comparing the MGA model to alternatives.

The Miller report* confirmed that utilising an MGA is both workable and
appropriate for Post Office, providing operational flexibility and increased
control on product and pricing. Miller also confirmed that it would create
income in line with projections and that the model overall was of low, and
manageable, risk. In particular Miller stated that:

“...we believe that setting up an MGA is a viable option for POL as this would
give you full control. An MGA would also give you enhanced economic value
through additional profit commission, whilst allowing you the underwriting
ability, flexibility around the coverage and pricing mechanisms to drive
change”.

The business case for the overall travel insurance program is being finalised
and will be tabled to POLIC in July; preliminary assessment confirms that the
financial projections are consistent with those set out in the Plan.

Management is in negotiations with Aon and Ageas to continue cover to
October 2014, thereby allowing a managed transition to the new model’.
While management is confident that agreement will be achieved before the
end of July, Aon have also been instructed to seek alternative underwriting
arrangements should agreement not be reached with Ageas.

The delivery of the MGA requires utilising a scalable multi-product insurance
platform. Management is in the process of identifying and procuring the
appropriate platform. This process will be completed in October 2013.

The Aon call centre employs up to 120 staff® and is dedicated to Post Office
travel insurance. With the migration to a new provider triggering TUPE’,
management is assessing the appropriate operating model and procurement
process. This evaluation will be complete by October 2013.

Insurance Buy-out from Bol

3.1

3.2

3.3

3.4

The Eagle contract established clear parameters for the Post Office to buy out
the insurance business from Bol, being:

e¢ One way call option from September 2014 to September 2016;
e Option price based on Bol’s discounted cash flow from the business.

At the March meeting, the Board agreed that management could seek to
advance this strategy with Bol ahead of the option period.

To assist accelerate the acquisition, management has engaged KPMG? to
develop a financial model and negotiating strategy. The KPMG report will
conclude in mid-July; initial feedback confirms that the indicative valuation
remains at c£20 million identified in the Plan.

Nick Kennett has had a preliminary conversation with the Bol Distribution
Director to ascertain Bol’s potential interest in pre-option discussions. He

Miller report 14” June 2013: “Commercial Travel Insurance — Options and deliverables for

creating a long term commercially viable and robust risk financing platform”.

While a quicker transition is achievable, migrating during the summer holiday season would add
considerable risk to the program.

The number varies through the year, with the peak occurring during the summer holiday period.

KPMG provided expert assistance during Eagle, including on the creation of the insurance
buyout option.
POL00099210

POL00099210

confirmed that Bol would entertain an offer, while seeking to ensure that “the
value of the insurance business is maximised over the long term for the
benefit of both partners”.

3.5 It is anticipated that management will be in a position to propose an
acquisition strategy in August.

Removing Junction from the Post Office Insurance Program

4.1 The Plan assumed that Post Office would no longer use Junction for general
insurance broking from 2015/16. Further analysis, in particular following
negotiations with Junction to confirm the extension of their services beyond
2014, it is now apparent that transition would occur in 2016/17.

4.2 This delay does not impact the 2020 outcomes, but does have timing
implications in 2015/16 and 2016/17 years.

Financial Services Sub-Brand

5.1. Final market research on various FS sub-brand options is underway, with
results due in mid-August. The rollout of a new sub-brand could occur from
September, although the rollout strategy and timings have yet to be finalised.

Financial Services Sales Model

6.1 To support the growth of mortgage sales, c50 mortgage specialists have been
trained and deployed in Crown branches, ahead of 100 planned by October.
The team will then be trained to perform under the new advised sales
regulation (Mortgage Market Review) that applies from April 2014.

6.2 The deployment of the new FS area and supervisory structure is well
underway with all three Regional Managers and 27 of the 36 Area Managers
recruited (with nine Area Mangers already in training). The full rollout of the FS
sales structure will be largely completed by October.

6.3 While it is very early days, the establishment of a dedicated and focused sales
structure alongside Crowns has shown improvements in both attitude and
outcome’.

6.4 The current FS sales incentive scheme does not encourage and reward
effective sales performance. Management, supported by Mercer LLC a
specialist HR consulting business, is developing a new incentive structure. It is
planned that this will be deployed from October, but will require sign off from
Bol and is subject to agreement with the CWU. The plans will also be shared
with the Financial Conduct Authority.

A few examples of the changed approach seen:

The Mortgage Specialist (MS) in Derby travelled to an agency for an appointment made by the
Financial Specialist (FSS) from Chesterfield on a Saturday; not only did she achieve the sale,
but used the conversation to sell two life insurance policies and booked a further appointment
for the FSS to discuss credit cards and travel insurance when the customer returns to complete
the documentation.

The MS in Manchester has achieved 15 mortgage applications since April (1.25 per week) by
engaging with local branches, attending their team meetings and sharing his mortgage
knowledge.

In the first six weeks of the Polo pilot, Diss Crown office averaged 2.3 applications per week.
After a direct coaching session through the new support structure sales have recently averaged
7 per week.

Customer Journeys and Data Analytics

7.2

7.3

74

The current customer experience while purchasing an FS product is often
poor and inconsistent by channel, leading to a high level of non-completion of
applications. Management is undertaking a review of all FS product journeys,
mapping the existing processes, seeking customer feedback on their
experience and requirements, and then building new processes. All FS
journeys will be mapped and new process agreed by Q1 2014/15. Changes
will be implemented as they are finalised, although some changes depend on
Post Office and partners’ systems development.

The credit card and personal loan processes have been mapped and new
models are being finalised; a review of the mortgages journey has been
completed and the review of savings products is about to commence. In all
cases, quick wins will be implemented immediately.

To confirm that these changes are benefiting customers’ experience baseline
surveys will have been completed by September to create a scorecard of FS
Net Promoter and effort scores, by product and channel.

Customer analytics work is behind schedule due to the audit of the Brands
database not being completed and the procurement risks being unresolved.
Management is seeking ways to bring this critical program back on track.

Current account

On 13" May the Post Office launched the current account in 29 branches.
Press coverage generated almost 650 separate articles across national
newspapers, regional press and broadcast media as well as online. The key
messages were successfully delivered and Nick Kennett was quoted 111
times. The story led on BBC and Sky with rolling coverage all day on both
channels. 95% of coverage was positive.

After 6 weeks, pilot applications are slightly ahead of target, although sales
are behind forecast as referrals for identity verification are higher than
anticipated. We anticipate reaching the sales threshold in September 2013.

Pre-paid debit card (PPD) — Project Penguin

Post Office is seeking to launch a new PPD card” for Christmas 2013.
FRES" has won a tender to launch a reloadable, general spend PPD card
branded “Post Office Money Card”. It will be available in branches and online.

Investments & Pensions

A strategic working group has been established with Bol to launch simple
investments products. Research is underway to assess demand, customer
requirements and delivery models. The target is to launch in early 2014.

Post Office is also investigating offering retirement solutions to respond to the
growing demand for planning products, in particular annuities. Management is
in discussion with market providers to offer a white label on-line solution, with
a view to a possible launch in late 2014.

Post Office already issues a Sterling PPD within the family of Travel Money Cards.

Payment Services Provider (PSP)'

The Plan highlighted the opportunity for Post Office to offer payment services
to SMEs, leveraging their high branch footfall. This service, which is the first
stage of the FS SME strategy, is on target for launch in October with Post
Office acting as an agent of a global payments provider’. The sales and
delivery model will be largely on-line and managed by the provider, minimising
systems build and branch impact. The business case will be completed in July
and is targeted to generate income of £500,000 in 2013/14.

Conclusion and Recommendation

9.1 There are a significant number of initiatives underway across FS to build a
sustainable business and deliver the long term strategy and revenue growth.
Initial results confirm the growth opportunity.

9.2 While these initiatives are broadly on track, it is critical that they complete
during 2013/14 to ensure that the business is positioned to deliver the higher
targets for 2014/15 and beyond

9.3 The Board is asked to note this paper.

Nicholas Kennett
Director, Financial Services
July 2013

A PSP enables businesses to accept card payments, either where their customer is present

with a card or where the transaction is completed remotely (“card not present” or CNP)
The shortlisted candidates are Global Payments and WorldPay.

Project Polo - Success Criteria

Purpose

14

At the meeting in May 2013, Directors asked management' to table the criteria
agreed with the Bank of Ireland (UK) plc (Bol) to confirm the success of the Polo
proof of concept (PoC). The satisfactory achievement of the criteria will confirm
the intent of Post Office and Bol to proceed to full rollout, and in particular for Bol
to procure a full scale current account platform.

1.2 This paper is tabled for noting.
Background
2.1. The current account is critical to Post Office’s ambition to build a successful

financial services business. The PoC will enable the Post Office and Bol to:

e Confirm the demand for a Post Office bank account and Post Office’s ability
to sell it;

« Understand customers’ behaviours and market reaction; and

e Assess the impact of these findings on the enterprise business case’,
product offering and sales processes.

Key Success Criteria

3.1

3.2

3.3

3.4

Prior to commencing the PoC, the parties agreed the criteria that would be used
to confirm the success of the PoC and hence enable the project to proceed to
full rollout. The assessment is based on four broad criteria and would apply once
1,500 accounts have been opened.

Volume and Type of Accounts — Do the accounts acquired reflect the expected
profile - volume, product type, channel of acquisition; has the sale of other
financial services products been impacted?

Measurement criteria - Sales volumes reach minimum threshold; less than 20
percent of sales arise through the contact centre®; account types broadly reflect
the wider market’.

Customer profile — Do customers’ behaviours with the product reflect that
anticipated?

Measurement criteria -Net Promoter Score exceeds 20 (confirming strong
customer satisfaction).

Prudential risk — Are there adverse product risks being experienced?

Measurement criteria - There are no significant credit or fraud losses and no
significant reputational damages for either party.

Action item 3k.

The EBC is the joint business case built by the Post Office and Bol.

These occur where an application is not completed in branch.

Assumed to be Standard account 66%, Packaged account 16% and Control account 18%

POL00099210
POL00099210

Post Office Ltd — Strictly Confidential

3.5 Commercial viability - Does the performance of the PoC meet both parties’
financial expectations as set out in the EBC.

Measurement criteria — The overall performance of the PoC is broadly consistent
with the EBC.

3.6 In agreeing the criteria Bol acknowledged that the assessment should take
account of the ‘lite’ version of the current account being offered in the PoC.

4. PoC Status and Actions

41 After six weeks, PoC applications are slightly ahead, although sales are slightly
behind forecast as referrals for identify verification are higher than anticipated.
While the parties are assessing process changes to reduce the referral rate, the
parties anticipate that the sales threshold of 1,500 will be reached in September
2013.

42 As a result, Post Office is finalising its requirements for the full rollout for
discussion with Bol.

4.3 Initial conclusions from the PoC do not highlight material variations from the
EBC.

44 Post Office and Bol are assessing the opportunity to expand the PoC to
additional areas, ahead of full rollout. This would utilise the existing platform.

5. Recommendation
5.1 The Board is asked to note this paper.

Nicholas Kennett
Director, Financial Services
July 2013

For example, the PoC does not include an SMS or mobile app, which could lead to more
enquiries, and does not allow internet account opening, as customers can only sign-up via a
branch in the target region.

Summary
+ Income is on target, both in period and YTD
+ Pillar income is on budget. Main drivers of favourable Government income are UKBA and Passports, with £0.3m due to timing of targets for ID Services that will unwind next
month. Adverse Mails performance has been impacted by a change in customer behaviour as a result of size based pricing, This has impacted on a number of products
* Costs are £0.8m greater than plan:
+ Direct product costs are adverse by £0.7m as a result of Brand spend early in the year.
+ Staff costs - A small delay in CTP savings have been offset by industrial action savings.

YTD Staff Costs are £0.6m adverse to budget.
This variance relates to the £100 payments paid to
employees that will be offset against year end
accruals in P3.

Vs. Prior Year
The staff costs are £1.8m adverse due primarily to
pay awards and also to increased use of staff, both
temporary and permanent such as FOoG and the
new communications directorate.

Headcount of 7,886 is 256 below plan and is due to
vacancies with the Network directorate, of which the
majority of vacancies are within the NTP followed by
CTP. The adverse variance in Crowns is due to the
delay to the duty reviews. Tight control of
recruitment has partially mitigated this

Vs. prior year headcount has increased by 49
primarily due to NTP.

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD
Chief Executive’s Report

1. Crown Transformation Programme (CTP) and industrial relations

e There have now been 7 strikes since the dispute with the CWU started just over 3 months
ago, which compares with 13 strikes over a 5 month period during the last industrial action
in 2007. The percentage of staff on strike continues to fall (61% for 20 June and 58% for
29 June, compared to a peak of 72%). We chose not to deploy managers on either
occasion but did nonetheless manage to keep over half of Crown branches open. The
strike action continues to garner very limited media coverage at the national level, with just
2 reports on 29 June and none on the 20 June.

e We are continuing to monitor the financial and service impacts of the strikes. While there
is typically a dip in the levels of customer satisfaction with queuing times in the Crowns on
strike days (from 83% to 63%), overall customer satisfaction levels have held up strongly
at around 86%. The net financial impact is also positive in the short-term, with the
reduction in Crown income more than offset by the wage savings and growth in nearby
agency income. However, clearly we need to remain watchful of the potential for longer-
term adverse income impacts which could undermine the breakeven target. We are also
developing detailed contingency plans to ensure we are ready to cope with strikes during
the summer (when resourcing would be stretched by staff holidays) and over the busy
Christmas period, or alternatively if the supply chain also went out on strike. Our
conclusion is that such scenarios are manageable but not without risk and some degree of
customer detriment.

e Taking these considerations into account, our strategy at this stage remains focussed on
implementing the CTP while redoubling our communications to employees to increase
buy-in and counteract the CWU’s messaging. However, given the risks of prolonged strike
action, in parallel we are also reviewing the pros and cons of alternative options to resolve
the dispute. The CWU have informally indicated that they would like to start negotiations
afresh, and we have responded by saying that we would be open to discussing alternative
approaches provided they are prepared to take their existing asks off the table which are
incompatible with delivering the breakeven requirement. We will update the Board on the
latest position next week.

e In relation to managers’ pay, we resumed talks with the CMA on 3 July following a new
counter proposal from Brian Scott, which would entail consolidating a proportion of the
lump sum payments with effect from April 2015. While Brian is looking for us to make an
unconditional commitment, clearly any offer of this kind would have to be consistent with
the maintenance of profitability in the Crowns. We are currently modelling the costs and
wider impacts ahead of a further meeting on 15 July, and will update the Board next week.

e — In terms of the CTP itself, we have informed all 292 retained branches of when they will be
visited as part of the modernisation programme. The aim is to have 45 branches
completed before Christmas and 117 by the end of 2013/14. We have already started
visiting the earliest waves of branches in order to consult staff on the proposed designs to
seek their input. In parallel, the design and customer journey for the new self-service
equipment (‘Post & Go’) are now finalised and ready for pilot later in 2013.

POL00099210

POL00099210

Our programme of 20 ‘Vision events’ across the country is nearly complete. This is a
crucial part of our engagement plans, involving staff from every branch in interactive
sessions on topics such as the branch redesigns, our plans for financial services growth
and the new Crown Leadership Excellence Programme for managers. Feedback so far
has been extremely positive with 96% of attendees saying the event has given them a
better understanding of the Post Office vision.

We have received 305 expressions of interest covering 69 of the 70 branches advertised
for franchising, which we are now evaluating to identify our preferred partners. Work is
ongoing to find potential partners for the one remaining branch.

2. Network Transformation

The programme has finished the first quarter 54 branches ahead of target at 1,600
contracts signed. Most of these additional branches have come from independent
conversions to mains, illustrating the continuing appeal of the model to sub-postmasters.
No multiple contracts were expected in the first quarter after the large batches signed at
the very end of last year. New operator contracts are broadly in line with target. The
programme remains on track to reach 3,000 contracts signed by March 2014.

As set out in the paper discussed with the Board on 22 June, we are actively progressing
branch openings for all of the contacts that have been signed, but it is taking time for
agents to secure available builders and prepare for their works. The programme mid-point
forecast remains 1,950 branches open by year end. ‘Beat rates’ are expected to remain
fairly steady through July and August at just over 20 per week, with an increase in
September to over 30 as the number of multiple openings increases, followed by further
increases in Q4. We are confident that we have the capacity to open branches when all
parties are ready, with 37 branches opened in the last week of June.

3. Mails

We are currently pursuing two main strands of activity with RM to seek to recover the
parcels volumes lost as a result of the April tariff change. Firstly we have proposed an
extended shoe box sized template to replace the current cube shaped exception to the
medium parcel template, which would increase the number of items accepted as small
parcels and thereby substantially reduce the price (by up to 50%) for customers who fall
into this bracket. RM have indicated that they should be in a position to approve this
change within the next two weeks with a view to announcing it by the end of July.
Secondly we are working with RM on a price discount of up to 20% on certain formats
through the Drop & Go service, which we are aiming to implement alongside the roll-out of
the service to the entire network on 29 July. We are also investigating with RM what
changes could be made to Drop & Go to enable a franking style permanent discount,
which would require regulatory approval and is therefore unlikely to be achievable until
autumn 2013 at the earliest.

Good progress is being made with RM in lining up retailers to use our new click and
collect service. Of particular note is the fact that MetaPack (a widely used delivery
management intermediary) is now close to completing the platform required to enable
their clients to link up with the service, opening up access to a wide range of retailers with

CEO Report Paula Vennells Page 2 of 5

minimal integration work required on their part. Discussions are currently underway via
RM with a number of major clients who we are aiming to sign-up over the coming months,
including Wiggle, Asos, Avon, Talk Talk, River Island, Debenhams, Dixons, Pro direct
soccer, Thorntons and Ideal Home Shopping. Others are looking more likely for a post-
Christmas launch, including Marks and Spencer, eBay and Shop Direct Group.
Discussions with Amazon are still ongoing, although we are unclear of their intentions at
this stage as they are currently experimenting with their own delivery solutions and locker
box locations.

The latest results from June show that segregation performance has been clearly
impacted by the NFSP action encouraging branches to stop segregating, with mixed bag
down by 8.4 percentage points (ppt) to 46.8%, 1st class down 4.5 ppt to 68.3% and 2nd
class down by 3.2% to 68.8% compared with the previous month. However, we have had
more constructive discussions with the NFSP over recent weeks around the possible re-
instatement of the incentive payment to sub-postmasters, with the NFSP now accepting
the important principle that this needs to be directly linked to performance going forwards.
Further work is underway with the aim of introducing a new scheme by October,
dependent on the outputs of the joint RM/PO Segregation Working Group, which is
defining the revised structure of segregation requirements and measurement. That group
has now developed a simplified segregation proposal which is being trialled in July within
two mail centre catchment areas. It is also looking at potential improvements to the
sampling regime and mail bag handover process.

4. Government services

We are continuing to engage DWP on options to extend the POca contract beyond 2015,
and have now received a clearer signal that they accept that some continuation beyond
that point will be necessary for both operational and political reasons. We are currently
undertaking detailed customer research and segmentation analysis which will enable us to
present well-developed and evidenced proposals to DWP in August. The ExCo discussed
an early draft of these proposals in June, reaching the conclusion that while there are
obvious downside risks the volumes and financial projections contained in our strategic
plan remain credible as a planning assumption.

In parallel we are also re-engaging with the DWP team leading the Universal Credit
programme, in particular through the new Programme Director Howard Shiplee. He has
accepted an invitation to visit the model office to see our identity management and

On 1 June we went live with the extended range of services for DVLA offering six new
transaction types such as HGV taxation, changes of taxation class and issuing duplicate
tax discs. On 3 July we also launched in 13 London Crown branches a new priority check
and send service for passports which guarantees the passport will be issued within 7
days. This is the first new channel that HM Passport Office has introduced since 1992.

5. Home services

e The migration of our telecoms services from BT Wholesale to Fujitsu continues to
progress according to plan. Testing and call centre training is well advanced and a
number of live services are now in place in the new environment. New orders will start to
be placed against the platform from 22 July and the migration of the existing base is
scheduled to take place by the end of September.

e We are close to being in a position to enter into exclusive negotiations with our preferred
supplier for mobile services and intend to enter into contractual negotiations in the next
fortnight. The technical solution looks strong and provides us with the opportunity to
deliver an integrated telecoms solution to support the development of attractive and cost
effective strong customer value propositions.

« Work is also progressing on our plans to enter the energy market. ExCo reviewed the full
range of market entry options in June reaching the conclusion that we should look to
develop a white label branded energy solution in the short term as this provides the best
strategic fit. This would allow us to enter the market quickly, at low cost and with limited
risk. However we will be seeking a flexible agreement with our chosen partner that would
allow the commercial model to evolve as we grew. We are now in a further phase of
market engagement with the aim of identifying a preferred partner towards the end of the
summer and launching the service in early 21014/15.

6. Marketing

e The latest brand metric results show two main performance themes. Following the positive
progression over recent months, the net promoter score (NPS) has dropped from 7 to -7.
This is overwhelmingly driven by the Royal Mail price increase, although could also be
partly affected by the industrial action in the Crowns. Experience from previous years is
that the NPS quickly returns to the pre-change levels, but nonetheless we are developing
a marketing plan to address this drop in tandem with the product developments outlined in
section 3 above. ‘Easy to do business with’ meanwhile shows strong performance with a
12 month rolling average at 46% (compared with 41% a year ago), driven in particular by
the positive impact of the network and crown transformation programmes and the ‘stress
free’ focus of the mortgage brand campaign.

e Since 20 June and throughout the summer period all of our marketing channels will be
focussed on the Post Office Travel Essentials range, under the headline ‘Get ready for
your holiday at the Post Office’. The campaign is focused on Travel Money, Travel
Insurance and Passport Check and Send but also incorporates the Credit Card travel
proposition. Early indications are that the campaign is delivering strong response rates
and performance in all of these product areas has been significantly above target at the
start of these crucial weeks.

7. Project Robin

¢ Formal consultation with employees on the proposed changes to the pension scheme was
launched on 21 June and is due to close on 25 August. Discussions are ongoing in
parallel with the CMA who have reviewed the proposals in significant detail, although at
this stage their formal position is that they do not support the changes. We met with the
CWU in June, although they have likewise stated that they do not support the proposals
within either Post Office or the Royal Mail.

e The Regulator has now been informed by the Trustee of the delay to the valuation with a
target date of 30 September. Assuming the proposal proceeds following consultation, the
detailed implementation work such as systems configuration is on track to implement the
changes from next April.

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD

Group Structure

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

14 brief the Board on planned changes to the structure of the wider Group to
facilitate an IPO of Royal Mail Group Ltd (“RMG’);

1.2 brief the Board on the anticipated changes to the operation of Royal Mail
Holdings plc (“RMH”); and

1.3. delegate authority (in the form set out in Appendix 1) to the Company Secretary
and/or the HR & Corporate Services Director to approve and execute any
documents necessary to remove the references to the RMG Special Share from
the Company's Articles of Association.

2. Background

IPO Structure

2.1 The intention is for the IPO listed group to have a non-trading holding company.
ShEx have directed this will be a new non-trading entity (“Topco”) inserted prior
to listing between RMH and RMG. This is anticipated to occur during September.

2.2 Topco will be initially incorporated as a third direct subsidiary of RMH, alongside
RMG and Post Office Limited. Subsequently RMG will be transferred from RMH
to Topco. These changes are illustrated below, together with the consequential
structures immediately prior to and at IPO. Note that RMH will be renamed in
advance of IPO to remove the reference to “Royal Mail”.

Current Structure Prior to transfer of RMG

Prior to IPO

Note: For simplicity the special shares in RMG, RMH and POL held by HMG are not included in the diagrams above.

Group Structure Susan Crichton Page 1of5 10 July 2013
POL00099210
POL00099210

Strictly Confidential

RMH Board

2.3. The RMH Board is comprised currently of two directors - Donald Brydon (RMG
Chairman) and Alice Perkins (Post Office Limited Chairman) — with Jon Millidge
as Company Secretary (also RMG Company Secretary).

2.4. September is viewed as the latest time for the composition of the RMH Board to
change to remove common directorships with the listed group.

2.5  ShEx plans for the future RMH Board to be composed of BIS officials acting
under direction of HMG, with this approach (i.e. acting under such direction)
entrenched in revised Articles of Association.

2.6 ShEx does not plan for the function of the future RMH Board to change from now
i.e. ShEx plans that it will continue to meet only as and when required to
discharge its necessary duties.

2.7. The adoption of revised Articles of Association for RMH, as well as changes to
the RMH Board, name, Company Secretary and registered office, are anticipated
to occur at or around the same time (i.e. around September).

Post Office Limited Special Share

2.8 The Secretary of State currently holds a special share in RMH, RMG and POL.
The rights attached to the special shares are set out in the respective Articles of
Association. The RMG Special Share will be redeemed or cancelled as part of
the steps to execute the insertion of Topco in advance of IPO.

29 The rights attached to the Post Office Limited Special Share include, for
example, the requirement for prior written consent of the “Special Shareholder”
for the “adoption of a Strategic Plan or any material variation or amendment of a
Strategic Plan previously adopted”.

2.10 However, under the current Articles of Association, the rights attached to the
Post Office Limited Special Share are “exercisable only for such time as the
Special Shareholder beneficially owns” all three of the special shares. A similar
provision exists in the Articles of Association for RMH and RMG.

2.11 Accordingly, an amendment is required to Post Office Limited’s Articles of
Association in order for the current rights attached to the Post Office Limited
Special Share to continue to be exercisable (the RMH articles will be similarly
amended). There will no longer be a requirement for the Special Shareholder to
beneficially own any of the other special shares in order to exercise the rights
attached to the Post Office Limited Special Share. It is proposed to remove any
other references to the RMG Special Share and the RMH Special Share at the
same time.

VAT Group impacts

2.12 POL and RMG (along with a number of RMG’s wholly-owned subsidiaries) are
currently constituent members of the VAT group of which RMH is the
representative member. The sale of more than 50% of the shares in either entity
would generally mean that the entity concerned would no longer fulfil the control
requirements for VAT grouping and would therefore need to leave the VAT group
(although there may be ways of retaining contro! and, thus, VAT grouping,
through use of alternative shareholdings). It has been agreed between RMG and
Post Office Limited that, for commercial and pragmatic reasons, RMG will retain

Group Structure Susan Crichton Page 2of5 10 July 2013
POL00099210
POL00099210

Strictly Confidential

the existing VAT group’s registration should the current VAT group structure
change.

2.13 To structure this change for VAT purposes, it is proposed TopCo will be
incorporated under the ownership of RMH and included in the RMH VAT group.
At the point when TopCo shares are sold, RMG and its subsidiaries within the
VAT group will remain under the control of TopCo but will no longer be controlled
by RMH. As a result, TopCo will then be considered to be the controlling body of
the VAT group (incorporating RMG and its subsidiaries). Consequently, RMH
and Post Office Limited will cease to qualify as members of the VAT group on
the basis that the controlling body will not own 50% or more of the shares in
either entity. RMH and Post Office Limited will therefore be required to register
as a new VAT group.

RMH Support Services

2.14 It is understood that the intention is to ask Post Office Limited to manage the
administration and accounting for RMH under the new structure. The following
list has been compiled as services that RMG currently provides to RMH:

* company secretarial support

* accounting services for consolidated management and statutory accounts (as
ultimate parent company and a plc there are considerable statutory reporting
obligations)

e settlement of invoices to group companies or third parties

* management of relationship with external auditors for statutory accounts and
consolidation issues (currently Ernst & Young)

* corporation tax returns, correspondence and support for payments

e tax accounting

e VAT filings

e employment tax and related support and filings for other tax as required
e provision of a senior accounting officer service

e treasury function (organising payments, management of investment portfolio,
ongoing banking and investment support services)

« insurance - provision of insurance within existing policies, participation in
current broker contract, management of the relationship with brokers,
renewal process, responding to insurance queries, management of major
loss claims

2.15 Whilst RMH is not a complex holding company, if Post Office Limited is asked to
provide these services there will be a resource cost and systems implications
which will need to be addressed. The scope of the Finance Roadmap Project to
separate our accounting systems will increase with associated cost and potential
delay.

3. Recommendations

The Board is asked to:
3.1 note the planned changes to the structure of the wider Group to facilitate an IPO
of Royal Mail Group Ltd (“RMG”);

(*RMH’);

3.3 note the additional duties that are likely to become Post Office Limited
responsibilities and that there will be additional cost as a result; and

3.4 approve delegation of authority to Alwen Lyons, the Company Secretary and/or
Susan Crichton, the HR & Corporate Services Director (in the form set out in
Appendix 1) to approve and execute any documents necessary to remove the
references to the RMG Special Share and the RMH Special Share in the
Company's Articles of Association and to do any act or thing required to be done
by the Company to give full effect to, or in connection with, the actions outlined in
this board paper.

Appendix 1 — Delegation of Authority

The intention is to delegate authority to Alwen Lyons, the Company Secretary and/or Susan
Crichton, the HR & Corporate Services Director to approve and execute any documents
necessary to remove the references to the RMG Special Share from the Company's articles. In
order to comply with Article 77 of the Company's articles (see below), such authority must be
first delegated to a committee of one or more directors who have the power to sub delegate to
non-directors.

The Board is therefore asked to:

1. Approve in accordance with Article 77 of the Company's Articles of Association, the
delegation of authority to a committee comprising Chris Day, Chief Financial Officer, with
the power to sub delegate, to approve and execute any documents which are required for,
ancillary to, or desirable in connection with the removal of the references to the RMG
Special Share and the RMH Special Share from the Company’s Articles of Association,
such approval in any case to be conclusively evidenced by the execution of the relevant
document; and

2. Direct this committee of the Chief Financial Officer to meet and immediately sub delegate
its authority, without the power to further sub delegate, to a committee comprising of the
Company Secretary and/or the HR & Corporate Services Director.

The Board may wish to consider amending Article 77 at a future point.

Article 77 — Delegation of the Board’s Powers

“The board may delegate any of its powers to any committee consisting of one or more
directors with power to sub delegate. It may also delegate to any managing director or any
director holding any other executive office such of its powers as it considers desirable to be
exercised by him, Any such delegation may be made subject to any conditions the board may
impose, and either collaterally with or to the exclusion of its own powers and may be revoked or
altered. Subject to any such conditions, the proceedings of a committee with two or more
members shall be governed by the articles regulating the proceedings of the board so far as
they are capable of applying.”

Notes of the discussions and Actions from the Board Awayday on the 18" and 19"
June 2013

Mutualisation overview
¢ Twin track approach discussed, needs to be without onerous costs or governance

« Concept of a council similar to a building society ‘members’ council’ supported by
user-groups was a preferred approach.

e The nature of the debate has changed and we need to tell the Minister what we can
do, what can be announced to show a positive move to more mutual ways of
working, without compromising the governance.

e ACTION The Board asked that the updated Rothschild report be circulated.
cD

e ACTION Check that the strategic plan refers to commercial sustainability and not
mutualisation and change of ownership SB

« Donot assume that change of Ownership has gone from the Govt. agenda. So we
need to stress the positive things we can commit to especially over the next 2 years

« All agree that aiming for sustainability is the goal and that focussing on new ways of
working makes business sense irrespective of ownership model.

New ways of working

« Direct communication to staff, subpostmasters and multiples are the top priority,
using the appropriate channel.

¢ The approach will cost time and money with possible deployment of super briefer into
the subpostmaster network. ACTION Suggestion that we ask franchise partners
what they do to engage branches MD/KG

«Concerns that POL and NFSP have very different ideas of how a Trade Association
relationship would work.

e Support to drive forward as quickly as quickly as possible with the ways of working
but take the Trade Association/ NFSP approach more carefully to give time to
explore

e ACTION Agreed that we would look at introducing a ‘members’ council of 20-30
people, with unions/staff/ subpostmasters and customers all represented. Return to
the Board with a full proposal in line with the agreed timeline SB

¢ ACTION The Board agreed the outline of the WoW timeline. Final proposal to be
circulated, excluding Trade Association ( although recognised that this may be
necessary, so SB to develop a TA proposal but off the page for now) SB

e The Board were uncomfortable with anyone but the shareholder ‘holding them to
account’. ACTION Check where the term ‘hold the business to account’ is used, and
come back with options for taking this forward without introducing additional
governance. SB

¢ Agreed that a ‘share scheme’, meaning ‘sharing in success not giving away shares
would be a possible approach but not until the Business ceased to be loss making.
POL00099210

POL00099210

This could be included in the pay principles in the long term strategy aligned with
WoW.

People

Structure means business focusing more on the customer, supported by a
transactional service delivery function (with work which could be outsourced), and a
very small corp. function ( which should also include HR and IT architecture for
thought leadership).

ACTION Show how many people as a % in each areas sc/cD

Need to isolate Customer functions from the ‘glue’ that stops the business delivering

MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING AND MATTERS ARISING

The minutes of the meeting held on 13 March 2013 were approved for
signature by the Chairman of the Committee.

The Chairman asked if a communication had been sent to the
participants explaining the new LTiP measures. SC explained that
knowledge of possible changes in the 2015 Network Transformation
targets and the current Industrial Relations environment had delayed the
correspondence but that she was reluctant to delay any longer. The
Chairman asked SC to discuss and decide on the approach with the
CEO, letting the Committee know their decisions.

SHORT TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (STIP) - OUTTURN AND PAYMENTS
FOR 2012/2013

The Committee received an update from FH on the internal audit review
of the outturn of the 2012/2013 scorecard measures completed on 30
April 2013. FH explained that the outturn had been capped in line with
the rules.

Alice Perkins reported to the Committee that the CEO had achieved 80%
of her personal objectives which were attributed to 20% of her bonus,

(b) The Committee approved the LTiP payment for the Chief Executive as
detailed in appendix 1 of the LTiP Outturn and Payments for 2012/2013

Remco and SLP populations. The LTiP would be paid in June 2013 in
accordance with the plan rules.

(a) The Committee considered the proposals to enhance the Clawback
clause in the LTiP rules and to include a Clawback clause in the terms
and conditions of the STiP for the Chief Executive (CEO), Chief Financial
Officer (CFO), Executive Committee, Remco and SLP.

(b) JH (NBS) informed the Committee that 3 years’ clawback would be the
longest he would expect to see in the market. FH explained that this
would require a change in the scheme rules which people would have to
sign up to if they were to be eligible for the LTiP.

(c) The Committee approved:

i. the change in the LTiP rules, effective from April 2013, to
enhance the Clawback clause as detailed in appendix 1 of the
Clawback Clause Paper; and

REMCOM SHORT TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (STIP) DESIGN FOR THE CHIEF
13/25 FINANCIAL OFFICER

(a) The Committee considered the proposal to change the design of the
Short Term Incentive Plan (STiP) for the role of Chief Financial Officer
(CFO) to align it with the STiP of the Chief Executive.

(b) JH (NBS) had supported the proposed increase of potential percentage
range of 40% on target and 67% for stretch and reported that the
changed gearing aligned with the market benchmark. The Chairman
noted that this was a significant reduction in maximum potential bonus
and asked the CEO if she thought the CFO would accept the changes.
The CEO was hopeful that the CFO would accept.

(c) The Committee approved the STiP design and increase in on-target
percentage for the CFO and agreed that the proposal should be
presented to the Shareholder Executive (ShEx) to review on behalf of the
Special Shareholder. KH was asked to produce a draft paper for review
by the Chairman setting out the proposal for ShEx.

REMCOM SHORT TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (STIP) MEASURES 2013/2014
13/26
The CFO joined the meeting

(a) The Committee considered the proposed Post Office Scorecard for
2013/2014 with particular reference to those measures which form the
Short Term Incentive Plan (STiP).

(b) FH clarified that ExCo was considering changing from the current PDR
multiplier to a more flexible approach but that no decision had yet been
reached.

(c) | The CFO explained the trajectory to Crown breakeven in 2015 from the
outturn of a loss of (£37m) in 2012/13, and that the target for 2013/15
was likely to be a loss of (23m).

(d) | The CFO explained that the Network Conversions target was to be set at
1550 contracts signed in the year, bringing the cumulative target by the
end of 2013/14 to 3000. He recognised that this would be contentious as
it was 600 less that the current strategic plan but assured the Committee
it was still a very stretching target. The Committee discussed the
problem of changing a target during the year if the strategy changed, but
agreed that the network measure should have a footnote to explain the
assumption that if the strategy changed the targets would need to
change too.

(e) The Committee agreed the ranges in the Growth, Profit and Easy to Do
Business With measures but asked that Plan target be referred to as
Threshold.

(f) The Crown Profit (loss) would be set at Threshold (£23m), Target (£23m)
and stretch (£21m).

ACTION: (g) | The CFO was asked to email the final scorecard to the Committee and
CFO then present the proposal to the full Board.

Karen requirements for the Report & Accounts and it was decided to report the
Hamer KPls as categories of Growth, Customer, People and Modernisation.

CFO Directors and agreed that the proposal should be presented to the Board
and then the Shareholder Executive to review on behalf of the Special
Shareholder.

REMCOM LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP) AWARD DATE APRIL 2013

13/27

(a) The Committee received a proposal on the performance conditions for
the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTiP), award date April 2013, payment
date March 2016, and performance conditions to be tested in the
financial year 2015/2016.

(b) The Committee discussed the structure of the proposal with Access
Criteria as the gateway and EBITDAS and EBITDAS/turnover as two
separate measures. It was recognised that the EBITDAS measure would
focus on driving the Business back to profit and that the artificial
measure of EBITDAS/turnover did not add any value.

ACTION:
Karen (c) The quantum awards presented in the paper at para 2.4 were not correct
Hamer and a replacement paper would be filed with correct stretch percentages.

(d) The Committee approved the design of the LTiP, award date April 2013,

years and a look back at the year of the accounts.

ACTION: _ , , -
Karen (c) Alice Perkins asked the Business to ensure that the DRR was aligned
Hamer with the rest of the R&A.

There are a number of activities, detailed below, which are currently underway and by October we will have a view of the business and
technology roadmap to support our strategic aspirations, at which point a paper will be placed in the Board reading room.

All of the activities support the 15 — 20 Strategy, and include the capabilities to deliver the FS income growth and have been included in our IT
plans and funding. We are currently defining our Customer Management Strategy and subsequently the technology roadmap. Javelin have
supported the definition of the strategic digital requirements which has included customer, complemented by a project to define our customer
management strategy by the end of June led by Nick Fox in Marketing, supported by Berkeley. We will take a pragmatic and incremental
approach to how we will deliver our customer management capability.

In addition, for Financial Services we are working with BOI to pilot a more detailed analysis/segmentation exercise to identify cross/up-sell

opportunities at a very granular level. The outcome is to generate targeted campaigns to fewer customers. This is a pilot and will inform our
strategic approach.

Health & Safety Report

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

1 Provide an update on safety performance.
1.2 Outline risk reduction activities.

2. Current Situation

2.1 Injury accidents, up to period 2, are showing a positive trend against last year, and
against the target reduction of 5%. Accidents involving absence have increased
from two to three compared to the same period last year but minor monthly
fluctuations are not unusual. The “per 1000 staff in post” comparison indicator,
which takes account of head count fluctuation year on year, is showing a slightly
more favourable trend for ‘all accidents’.

2.3

The number of road traffic collisions (RTCs) during the first two periods has
increased significantly compared to the same period last year although the
trend during period 2 is more in line with expected monthly performance and ‘at
fault’ incidents are running at the same level as last year. Road risk reduction
opportunities continue to be the subject of analysis at the Road Risk Forum with
a view to identifying improvement activities in addition to those already in place.
(3.1 below) Injuries as a result of road traffic collisions are infrequent. Road
traffic collisions account for less than 3% of the overall number of injury
accidents, however they have the potential for high impact in terms of injury and
loss.

The majority of accidents currently fall into three main categories: lifting and
handling, stepping and striking and outdoor falls. These are high frequency
events with, in the majority, relatively low severity. The lower frequency types of
incident can carry the potential for very high impact, for example, assaults and
road traffic collisions. .

Robberies on Post Office Cash and Valuables in Transit (CViT) crews are at the
same level as last year at 7 cumulative for the first two months. Physical injuries
during robberies, of which there have been 2, the same as last year, remain
relatively minor in severity. Two of the seven robberies were enabled by the
presence and/or threat of use of fire arms however the firearms were not
discharged. Risk reduction activities are identified at 3.2. (Appendix 1 —
Significant Incidents refers)

Robberies and attempted robberies on the Post Office network, cumulative to
period 2, are significantly lower than last year — 11 compared to 18. The ratio of
successful robberies has reduced from 78% to 54%. Supporting activities have
been introduced to continue to mitigate this risk and are identified at 3.2.
(Appendix 1 — Significant Incidents refers)

Burglaries and attempted burglaries (which do not involve personal attack) have
reduced from 13 to 8 compared to the same two month period last year.

3. Activities

Analysis and evaluation of data (e.g. risk profiles) to determine further accident
reduction interventions

Introduction of coloured ‘high visibility’ seat belts on new vehicles

Safety team input and concurrence for vehicle specification and changes

Safe driver of the year award

Weekly case conferences to ensure consistent approach to accident
investigation, follow up activity and sharing of best practice

Robbery/Burglary Risk

Current activities to mitigate robbery and burglary risk are:

robbery, spraying those involved and enabling identification of the individuals
involved in the robberies

Significant reduction in opportunities for duress type robberies linked to the
introduction of single person vehicles
