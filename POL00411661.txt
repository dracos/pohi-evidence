Post Office I 2016 Board Review Overview Page 1

Post Office - 2016 Board Review Overview

Phase One - Survey

The process began with the design of the review content in close collaboration with the Chairman and Company
Secretary, ensuring that the specific needs of the Post Office Board are addressed and allowing questions to be framed
around key events. The review covers the performance of the Board, its Committees the Chairman and individual
Directors, and the precise scope has been agreed with the Post Office.

All Directors will be invited to complete their surveys online using the Lintstock Review Service. Participants are also
able to raise any matters in confidence with a Lintstock Partner, should they wish to do so.
Phase Two — Presentation

Lintstock delivers a report composed of concise narrative, with supporting graphical data, including a series of key
recommendations and one-page executive summary. No redundant or unnecessarily technical language is used and the
anonymity of all respondents is ensured.

A Lintstock Partner is available to facilitate the Board’s discussion of the results, and provide further context concerning
the output, including peer comparison. We often also separately brief the Charman and/or Company Secretary.
