Subject:Next steps following meeting with James Arbuthnot’

Alice
Paula and I have spoken and she asked me to do you a note of next steps following your meeting with James Arbuthnot.

James emailed MPs, copying Second Sight and JFSA, to tell them that he had met with you and that he would be inviting
them to a meeting in March.

David and I have spoken with James’ office to agree next steps. These are:

- we are doing a first draft of the letter of invitation to MPs for James to consider, including a draft agenda
- we are exploring suitable dates for the meeting, likely to be first half of March, and also a pre-meeting between Paula
and James to agree the ‘ground rules’ for the meeting.

Also, James’ office agreed to the benefit of an agreed note of the meeting you had with him and we have a draft
(cleared by Paula) which we will share with his office later today for comment/agreement.

Just so that you are aware, I have agreed with James’ office that we should keep in touch going forward to ensure that
we proactively manage this relationship and that, moving forward, we are their first port of call for information and
resolving any issues.

Best wishes

Belinda
