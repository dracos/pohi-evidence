lam somewhat surprised to note the contents of the first paragraph of your memo and can but
apologise for the omission. Copies of all the Notices of Additional Evidence are being forwarded to you
in the post.

I note your request for electronic copies of the spreadsheet exhibits. I have asked Manish Patel, the
officer in the case, to make these available

Dear Debbie

We note the recent Notice of Additional Evidence in relation to the above (namely: statement of
PATEL ) and would ask that you kindly forward an updated schedule for both statements and exhibits.
This was not supplied with the NAE nor was is supplied on previous NAE’s.

Finally, our forensic accountants have asked that we provide them with, if possible, electronic copies
of the spread-sheet exhibits. Would you kindly forward these by email as soon as possible.

Regards

Dear Deborah

I refer to the CD Rom provided labelled : Rugeley PO Bureau Figures (Wks 1 — 43) and advise that we
are unable to view the material held on said disc. It would appear that the data is missing from the
spreadsheet (for example, see attached).

Would you kindly send a correct copy of the schedules in CD Rom format.

Regards
