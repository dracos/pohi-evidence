Subject: HNGX Programme Delays and Operational Issues

Duncan,

The new POL CEO, Dave Smith, started today. Mike Young mentioned before he went away that if/when the new CEO
arrived he would likely be reaching out to Richard in his first few days in the role.

By way of a briefing for Richard, please review the following:

HNGX pilot was progressing well and moved into day 4 of high volume pilot (to 215 branches) on Thursday 25 March. 208
branches were successfully rolled out ~ a good outcome. Then began a catalogue of outages/issues as follows:

pact, comments

Two HNG-X service outages affecting
all branches. The first of these
occurred at 12.30 p.m., when
branches reported loss of connection
to the datacentre. This was caused byI
the Branch Application Layer (BAL)
hanging. The BAL servers were
recycled to restore service by 1.45

p.m. At 2.55 p.m. there was a second
loss of service for 30 minutes when
there were problems with Node 1 of
the Branch Database.

POL verbally stated that the outages
were causing them considerable
problems with the NFSP (National FedI
of Sub-Post masters) who were
threatening to contact the press.

Current Status

configuration changes were made on the
latabase components to alleviate the
jssue and ensure a more rapid recovery
rom the outage. Oracle were engaged on
pp Priority 1 Incident and 247 diagnostics
as enabled.

JA recommendation was made by Oracle to
ipgrade to Patch set 3

Volume Pilot to move ahead unti

The above reflects the significant issues we have experienced over a short time span. Relationships with the POL leadership
are tense and we are clearly on the back-foot. Dave Smith (as in the CIO that has just retired from POL) takes with him a
maturity of approach and first hand experience of the original roll-out of Horizon, his counsel to Mike Young and the POL ET
was that there were many large issues back then and that these should be expected now ~ this is a loss to our cause.
However, we do still have a strong supporter in Andy Mclean, the POL Service Director ~ whilst not pleased with where we
are he advocates a logical cooperative ethic to overcome issues and is concerned by some of the more emotional reactions
he is seeing within POL.

Dave Smith (from Parcelforce) started today, and has met with the HNG-X POL Team. Our contacts tell us that he is likely to

take a more cautious stance towards re-starting the pilot. The National Federation of Sub-postmasters will not allow any more
of their members’ branches to be migrated to HNG- for the time being. The likely way forward is that POL will look to deploy
HNG-X to all their Crown offices first, to prove that the system works and to persuade the Federation to continue.

We are working to agree the criteria upon which we can move forward with the pilot, in the mean time we continue to
implement patches/fixes and monitor system performance.

hope this is useful, apologies for the length, but wanted to make sure you had the context/detail.
Kind regards,

Gavin
