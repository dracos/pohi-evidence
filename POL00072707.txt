I had a telephone conversation with Davlyn Cumberland. She was returning a call I had left
on her telephone voicemail in relation to what was meant and it was said that they were
unable to find anything that was “wrong”. She meant the word unusual and I have already
amended the witness statement to reflect that. Saying that I had emailed it to her and
asking her to review it, if she is happy with to approve it by printing out two copies signing
and dating it and giving her my address so that she could return one copy to me and retain
the other for herself.
