Patrick / Belinda
Thanks for your email, and the other document.

Q&A:

I have made a few changes here and there, but not that many. There are a couple of outstanding issues highlighted in
yellow that I would appreciate us discussing tomorrow. I will be in from around 0750 so feel free to call when you
have had a chance to look. I have attached a clean version, and a marked up one.

Other document:

Thanks for this, I do like it. I suppose the speech I sent is slightly more conciliatory although I would be happy to test
with Jo on Tuesday whether she would like to go more on the front foot (e.g. putting in a module for the speech which
rejects the notion of acting in bad faith). I do think that I have incorporated much of the sentiment anyway.

Speech:

1am keen to lock down the speech, and the Q&A if possible, by 11am tomorrow. That will give me time to get all the
necessary docs in order before the submission deadline of two pm (bearing in mind I have a couple of interviews to do
after 11 for the POL team here). Please could you therefore prioritise any comments on the speech rather than the
Q&A, given the latter has already had significant input from POL its broadly agreed.

Arbuthnot letter:
Finally, could you please forward me the JA letter to Paula — I have obviously seen it but I cannot find it in my inbox
(not sure who sent it). Anyway, grateful if you could resend,

Thanks for all your hard work over the weekend, I think we are in pretty good shape (unless you have major issues
with the speech).

Cheers
Richard

Here you go.
