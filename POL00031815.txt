    • Cleveleys (Subpostmistress Mrs Wolstenholme) arises
      around Horizon introduction


    • Post Office pursued debt through the courts

• Cleveleys
   — Discrepancy contested
   — Solicitor appoints "expert"
   — Expert was not challenged or managed
       • Expert assumes status of "joint" expert
       • Produced a report which in my view exposed the expert as a
         "sham"
       • Nonetheless expert concluded that Horizon could have
         caused the discrepancy
   — Did not have access to audit trail so couldn't refute
      • That is prove that what the expert said could happen didn't
        happen
   — Settled out of court £187.5k (cost included)




• Shortly after a case called Castleton emerged
   — Subpostmaster contested our claim saying Horizon was at fault
   — We submitted audit trail as evidence
   — Believe Castleton's solicitor examined audit trail and concluded there
     was no substance to Castleton's claim and advised him to settle
   — Castleton sacks solicitor and proceeds
     Court rules in our favour with costs Castleton looking at f300k liability
     and declares himself bankrupt
   — Judge decided that were was "inflow" in the Horizon system, and
     that "the logic of the system is correct": he said "the conclusion is
     inescapable that the Horizon system was working properly in all
     material aspects".

• Castleton "killed" the noise until Computer Weekly ran an
  article in 2009
   — Even though the journalist conceded that there was little
      hard evidence
• Closely followed by an S4C programme
• Interest in the press
• And a glut of flag cases
• And interest from a growing number of MPs
• A small group of golden oldies
• But signs that a larger group rallying to the cause

  — Claim that the system either in failure mode or
    through other means can create a difference
    between the machine calculated cash balance and
    physical cash




• Horizon is designed so that accounting
  integrity is maintained when it fails
• We are not defending the fact that it doesn't
  fail
• Attached pdf document explains how
• The audit file will show what happened

    — Bates had discrepancies but was dismissed because he became
      unmanageable. Clearly struggled with the accounting and despite
      copious support did not follow instructions
    — Ward has been dismissed twice for failing to follow accounting
      instructions
    — Subpostmaster who pleaded guilty in court
    — Castleton who put the argument that it was Horizon at fault before
      the court and lost
