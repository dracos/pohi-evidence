Subject: RE: Channel Integration Phase 1 Acceptance Report - REQGENACS2061 v0.2

all,

Please see below a few brief notes, actions and decisions made at today's Channel Integration Phase 1
Acceptance meeting.

Dave Cooke outlined the Acceptance criteria for progression and summarised the current position against
the 13 CI Phase 1 requirements;

7 met by Design walkthrough - completed at todays session. CI-POC-09 to 11 refer to processing of CI data
to MI, reconciliation and accounting systems. POL accepted the limitation of the CIT environment in
respect of demonstrating these requirements and accept the provisio that data demonstrated to have been
transferred to the branch database can be assumed to fall within existing BRDB extract processes.

3 met through Test - more accurately demonstration within the CIT environment. POL accept that the
demonstration provided evidence to fulfil these testable requirements

2 met through document review - POL accepted that the Phase 1 AIS had not been circulated at the time of
the meeting, but has subsequently been issued for review and approval.

DECISION: All parties present agreed that the criteria had been met and supported the recommendation to
proceed through the Acceptance Gateway.

Regards

James
