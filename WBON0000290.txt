Dear Katie

Rebecca has looked at the bug scripts and the docs you raise queries on below. We then discussed the docs and
the general approach and I set out our thoughts below. Essentially, we think that (i) where a doc has already been
disclosed and is relevant to the story of the bug, it should be put in the TB; (ii) we should not be providing further
disclosure unless we are under an obligation to do so (adverse doc or should have been previously disclosed etc);

and (iii) we should not at this stage be asking 3" parties for further docs.

1am conscious that some of the docs may not be seen as helpful to PO’s case. However, if, as seems to be the
case, they are part of the story of that bug, I think it is artificial to omit them

I think the intention is to upload a big batch of docs: these should form part of that batch.

Any questions, do not hesitate to ask or call

Best

Subject: 7 additional bug reports [WBDUK-AC.FID123887118]

Rebecca, Simon,

As promised, please find attached copies of the 7 additional bug reports. As discussed yesterday, these have not
been reviewed by Andy. I have included our queries regarding disclosure and the addition of documents to the trial
bundle in the below table below. In terms of timings for adding documents to the trial bundle, we propose to keep a
record of any and add these to the list Tony sends through before trial so that everything can be added in one go,
unless you need the trial bundle references sooner.

Kind regards

Katie
