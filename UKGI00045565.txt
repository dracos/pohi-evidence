Aaaaargh - sorry Tom was on my mind re POL! I meant Charles! Apologies.

The POL Remco had not originally felt that bonuses should be reduced. Our Board was not involved.
On Thomas Cook we were involved extensively all over the weekend and before.

with best wishes

Many thanks for this - I was considering dropping you /Mark a note to understand the level of our
involvement in Tomas Cook ?

On POL I am not clear who was saying that bonuses shouldn’t have been reduced ( apart from those
affected ) was it the view of our Board or POL board ?

On CEO internal interest - a little surprised re Tom , knew about Candida as a possibility and
assume Charles is a definite ?

Just going into an AC meeting with LTA so apologies for quick reply .

Best

the postmaster litigation and the excoriating judgement. There was a good discussion on the issues which
I thought was really helpful in getting towards solutions. The end result was agreement that Alex and Tom
should meet the Chair of POL to discuss the key issues facing POL and clear the air. The discussion on
Governance and Portfolio was a staging point towards a wider discussion in November but encouraging in
what is being addressed and particularly on the people aspects. In addition there was a good update on
our MOD work.

I am seeing Tom and Candida later this week. Tom is enthusiastically in the process. Candida's position

is less clear and I will find out more at lunch with her today.

Look forward to catching up soon.

With best wishes
