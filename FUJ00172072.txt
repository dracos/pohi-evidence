Gareth,

I am happy providing Pete is ok that this does not undermine/commit us to anything that he has not yet bottomed
out commercially, and that Tim is happy that we have the agreed NDA’s in place ( I believe we bottomed these out).

Hi Torstein

On Monday, Ervin and I will be joined by Aaron Chu. There would have been another team member but unfortunately
he has been taken ill.

We look

Ervin,
FUJ00172072
FUJ00172072

Please find attached a series of documents which represent the starting point for us.

The power point is a high level overview of what I believe is the scope for stage 0. It shows the journey from the
counter through to the audit trail.

Gareth has updated a document that we shared with you previously. We could probably trim that down further — for
example, we may agree that discussion on recovery scenarios and how recovery works might now be redundant — but
I believe we can engage sensibly with the document in its current state.

The zip file contains lower level documents referenced from Gareth’s.

Our address is

Lovelace Road
Bracknell
RG12 8SN

And in case you don’t have my number it is.

I look forward to seeing you on Monday.

Regards etc
Torstein

Hi Torstein,
A 10am start would be great for next Monday 20" Feb at your Bracknell office.

At this stage from KPMG it will be Christ Starnes and myself. Given you will be providing a demonstration of the
solution I would also like to bring two others that will be involved in the review, and will advise of these names shortly.

The proposed agenda is fine.
Kindly advise of the address of your office.

GRO “

Ervin,
Thanks for your email.

I have booked room 112 in Bracknell from 1000 till 1600 on Monday 20" so we can be flexible within that time
band.

I'd like to make it a working day so I would suggest an agenda of:-

Introductions

Demonstration of the Horizon system to put the exercise in perspective.
Walkthrough documentation

Agree next steps for stage 0

PrP >

If this works for you, then could you confirm arrival time and who will be coming to Bracknell?
I will forward documentation to you by close of play on Wednesday, assuming that suits.

Regards etc
Torstein
