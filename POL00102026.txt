Dear all

I'm glad to report that, at time of writing, we have succeeded in persuading the BBC to drop the report
planned for tomorrow morning on BBC Breakfast.

The inside Out programme will go ahead in the evening, but if this position remains, it is a big win for
us: by pushing the BBC relentlessly this weekend we have sewed enough doubt in their minds, at present at
least. It could change but even to have got to this place is very welcome

Great team work by the Sparrow and communications teams.

Mark

have called us within the last 30 minutes to ask for a statement. This is generated by the same
journalist covering the story for the BBC Inside Out programme.

you now.

Best wishes
