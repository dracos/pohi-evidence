Well done mark. In the circumstances this feels quite balanced.

This is the BBC online report around Horizon. Earlier inaccuracies
have been corrected and our clear line included. We will continue
to monitor coverage, though it is pleasingly low on BBC
schedules.

We will update Board in morning. BIS are aware and in loop. Jo
Swinson has requested a brief for the morning - we are working
with Richard Callard on that.

Worth reminding ourselves that this is what we expected to happen
and in the current news agenda this is not likely to stay in the news
cycle for long.
