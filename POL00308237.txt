Hi Alice. I hope you have had a gentler day today and not another Board meeting. I've had a good meeting with
Gillian Guy and Mark Davies on cutting costs and aligning our policy interests better; and Neil H and I have
interviewed a very good and experienced Chief Risk Officer. (We will bring him in immediately as he is available
as an interim and continue to interview 1/2 others for the permanent position.)

I'm attaching a draft copy of a letter to James Arbuthnot. I have toned it down considerably - it is still clear in its
message but hopefully gives little reason to overreact. However, as written communication is a particular gift of
yours (as well as your Chairman interest in Sparrow), I wanted to give you the opportunity to review it. (It has
been cleared by Mark and legal.)

Ideally I need it back by tomorrow am. If you don't have time, just let me know.
Thanks,
Paula

Dear Gavin

As discussed, I was in touch with Counsel's Clerk to talk about likely next steps and he offered during
POL00308237
POL00308237

that conversation to put it under the QC’s nose. The attached reflects his suggestions in tracked changes,
received in the last 10 mins. He said that none were crucial but were designed to create as much
flexibility for us as poss [in the unlikely event of a future challenge].

Best wishes
