30" September 2015 -

Thank you for your letter of 10°" September 2015.

Having had my first 2 days of induction to the Post Office just last week, I am considering how to
fulfil the commitment I gave you to take a fresh look at the Post Office’s handling of the complaints
raised with it in connection with its Horizon electronic point of sale and accounting system.

To this end, and to promote the independence of the exercise, I propose to instruct a QC to advise
me as to the appropriate scope of my investigation, how I might best conduct the necessary
enquiries, and to assist me in considering both how to present and, as necessary, act on my findings.

I expect to finalise the appointment shortly and will be in a position to share the scope and timetable
with you soon after my return from leave on 12" October 2015.

Yours sincerely

Tim Parker
Chairman
