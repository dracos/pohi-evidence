Dear All,

This case was called on before HHJ Burn in Court 5 at c. 12.20 for
PCMH

I had previously had the opportunity of discussing the case with
Chris Knight and Paul Southin. Rob and I discussed the case earlier
this week.

Defence Counsel was Mr Neil Clarke of 2 Park Square. I had negotiated
with him throughout the morning.

Ms Hall pleaded guilty to Count 2: Fraud (false accounting). I
indicated that the Crown was prepared to leave Count 1 on the file on
the usual terms.

The Defence Basis of Plea was as per D’s interview and that she had
the benefit of keeping her job and putting off the need to repay the
shortfall. She maintained that she had not taken any money. I
indicated that the Crown was content for her to be sentenced on that

basis.

A stand down Pre-Sentence report was ordered and the case next listed
at 14:15.

Ct 1: ordered to lie on file.
Ct 2: Community Order with an unpaid work requirement of 120 hours.
Costs £1000 to be paid within 12 months.

Confiscation Order made:

1. Benefit £14,842.37;
2. Available Amount £14,842.37;
3. Confiscation ordered by way of Compensation to

Royal Mail Group Limited in the amount of £14, 842.37.

The Compensation was ordered to be paid within 12 months (6 months
extended upon Defence application to 12 months) and a default term of
imprisonment of 6 months was ordered in default of payment.

Best regards,
