Age if under 18 Over 18 (If over 18 insert ‘over 18')

This statement (consisting of two pages each signed by me) is true to the best of my knowledge and
belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable to prosecution if I have
wilfully stated in it anything which I know to be false or do not believe true.

Signature J Partridge
I am the person named above and reside at the address as shown overleaf. I am currently

employed as a sales assistant at South Warnborough Village Shop, where I have worked
since January 2005.

Approximately two weeks after commencing work at the village shop ! began assisting in
the Post Office, which is situated within the Village Shop. I would assist the Postmistress, Mrs
Josephine Hamilton as and when required. It could be a matter of covering in the Post Office
for a few minutes, or if busy, I could be working in there for up to an hour, although this only
occurred on rare occasions. Sometimes I worked in the Post Office alone, other times I would
work alongside Mrs Hamilton. Other than Mrs Hamilton and myself, I am not aware of

anyone else working in the Post Office during my time employed there.

The duties I performed were generally selling stamps to customers wishing to post letters
and packets, although I also dealt with pension and allowance customers and those wishing
to pay domestic household bills. I also served customers in respect of the Post Office Card

Account. I received no formal training but was shown how to conduct these transactions by
Mrs Hamilton.

I did not assist with the balancing at the Post Office and I have not completed any cash

declarations. I only used the cash that was kept, during opening hours, in the counter drawer.
I did not access the Post Office safe and was unaware how much money was housed in it. If

the cash in the counter drawer was getting low, it would be Mrs Hamilton who replenished it
from the Post Office safe.

\haven't worked in the Post Office since March 2006, when a temporary Postmaster was
installed.

\ have not stolen any money from the Post Office and am unable to offer any explanation

as to why there would have been a significant deficit in the accounts, when the Post Office
was audited on 09 March 2006.
