Penny,

Sorry it has taken a while, but I've finally got round to looking at them. I've added comments to two of them
(the other was fine).

I'm happy to come and talk it through with you when you're ready.

I'd like to have them reviewed again, to make sure they are still correct. I know life is a bit
fraught at the moment but do you think you would be able.to help me again, say in the next

few weeks?

If you can help, I could either e-rnail them to you or, better still, perhaps we could spend half

an hour together.

Probably the simplest thing is if you email them to me and when I've had a chance to look through

them we can get together.

In January 2006 a change was made to the original extract query to include additional records from the
raw audit data. In particular this refined query now includes details of Inactivity Logouts, Authority Logouts
and Failed Logins. it should be noted that no changes were made to the original Audit data but just to the
selection of records from the Audit for presentation to Post Office Limited in the ARQ Spreadsheet.

Each Horizon counter has'two Inactivity timers set. The first one detects that nothing has happened at the
counter for 15 minutes and if triggered, causes the password screen to be displayed. In order to use the
terminal, the user must re-enter their password. This activity is not explicitly recorded in the raw data.

The second timer is triggered after 75 minutes of inactivity (ie one hour after the Password screen is
displayed). In this case, the following happens:

If the user was in the middle of a customer session (ie ‘stack’ has transactions in it), then the customer
session is settled to cash and a receipt printed. The transactions are recorded in the normal way. The

I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account, formally ICL Pathway Ltd
since 20 January 2004 as an Information Technology (IT) Security Analyst responsible for audit
data extractions and IT Security. I have working knowledge of the computer system known as
Horizon, which is a computerised accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. I am authorised
by Fujitsu Services to undertake extractions of audit archived data and to obtain information
regarding system transactions recorded on the Horizon system.

Horizon’s documented procedures stipulate how the Horizon System operates, and while I am
not involved with any of the technical aspects of the Horizon System, these documented
processes allow me to provide a general overview.

At each Post Office there are counter positions that have a computer terminal, a visual display
unit and a keyboard and printer. This individual system records all transactions input by the
counter clerk working at that.counter position. Clerks log.on to the system by using their own
unique password. The transactions performed by each clerk, and the associated cash and
stock level information, are recorded by the computer system in a stock unit. Once logged on,
all transactions performed by the clerk must be recorded and entered on the computer and are
accounted for within the user's allocated stock unit.

The Horizon system provides a number of daily and weekly records of all transactions input

An audit of all information handled by the TMS is taken daily by copying all new messages to

where events recorded in the Transaction Logs, were shown in local time. This meant that
during the designated summer months ‘Transfer In‘ log entries were recorded in BST instead
of GMT and showed a one hour forward displacement in time from other transactions being
recorded in the logs. This anomaly was corrected during the winter months prior to BST 2005
since when ‘Transfer In’ log entries have been recorded in GMT, consistent with all other
transactions being recorded in the logs.

When information relating to individual transactions is requested, the data is extracted from the
audit archive media via the Audit Workstations (AW’s). Information is presented in exactly the
same way as the data held in the archive although it can be filtered depending upon the type of
information requested. The integrity of audit data is guaranteed at all times from its origination,
storage and retrieval to subsequent despatch to the requester. Controls have been
established that provide assurances to Post Office Internal Audit (POIA) that this integrity is
maintained. .

During audit data extractions the following controls apply :

1. Extractions can only be made through the AWs which exist at Fujitsu Services,
Lovelace Lane, Bracknell, Berkshire and Fujitsu Services, Sackville House, Brooks
Close, Lewes, East Sussex. These sites are both subject to rigorous physical security
controls appropriate to each location. All AWs are located in a secure room subject to
proximity pass access within a secured Fujitsu Services site.

2. Logical access to the AW and its functionality is managed in accordance with the
Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account Security Policy and the principles of ISO 17799.
This includes dedicated Logins, password control and the:use-of Microsoft Windows NT
security features.

3. All extractions are logged on the AW and supported by documented Audit Record
Queries (ARQ's), authorised by nominated persons within Post Office Ltd. This log can
be scrutinised on the AW.

details are checked and the printed request filed.

The required files are identified and marked using the dedicated audit tools.
Checksum seals are calculated for audit data files when they are written to audit
archive media and re-calculated when the files are retrieved.

8. To assure the integrity of the audit data while on the audit archive media the checksum
seal for the file is re-calculated by the Audit Track Sealer and compared to the original
value calculated when the file was originally written to the audit archive media. The
result is maintained in a Check Seal Table.

10. The files are copied to the AW where they are.checked and converted into the file type

required by Post Office Ltd.

The requested information is copied onto removal CD media, sealed to prevent

modification and virus checked using the latest software. It is then despatched to the

I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account, formally ICL Pathway Ltd
since 20 January 2004 as an Information Technology (IT) Security Analyst responsible for audit
data extractions and IT Security. I have working knowledge of the computer system known as
Horizon, which is-a computerised accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. I am authorised
by Fujitsu Services to undertake extractions of audit archived data and to obtain information

regarding system transactions recorded on the Horizon system.

Horizon’s documented procedures stipulate how the Horizon System operates, and while I am
not involved with any of the-technical aspects of the Horizon System, these documented
processes allow me to provide a general overview.

At each Post Office there are counter positions that have a computer terminal, a visual display
unit and a keyboard and printer. This individual system records all transactions input by the
counter clerk working at that counter position. Clerks log on to the system by using their own
unique password. The transactions performed by each clerk, and the associated cash and
stock level information, are recorded by the computer system in a stock unit. Once logged on,
all transactions performed by the clerk must be recorded and entered on the computer and are
accounted for within the user's allocated stock unit

The Horizon system provides a number of daily and weekly records of all transactions input

into it. It enables Post Office users to obtain computer summaries for individual clients of Post
Office Limited e.g. National Savings Bank and Alliance & Leicester. The Horizon system also
enables the clerk to produce a periodic balance of cash and stock on hand combined with the
other transactions performed in that accounting period, known as a trading period.

Where local reports are required these are accessed from an icon on the desktop menu. The
user is presented with a parameter driven menu, which enables the report to be customised to
requirements. The report is then populated from transaction data that is held in the local
database and is printed out on the printer. The system also allows for information to be
transferred to the main accounting department at Chesterfield in order for the office accounts

to be balanced.

The Post Office counter processing functions are provided through a series of counter
applications: the Order Book Control Service (OBCS) that ascertained the validity of DWP
order books before payment was made, this application ceased in June 2005; the Electronic
Point of Sale Service (EPOSS) that enables Postmasters to conduct general retail trade at the
counter and sell products on behalf of their clients; the Automated Payments Service (APS)
which provides support for utility companies and others who provide incremental in-payment
mechanisms based on the use of cards and other tokens and the Logistics Feeder Service
(LFS) which supports the management of cash and value stock movements to and from the
outlet, principally to minimise cash held overnight in outlets. The counter desktop service and
the office platform service on which it runs provides various common functions for transaction

recording and settlement as well as user access control and session management.

Information from counter transactions is written into a local database and then replicated
automatically to databases on all other counters within a Post Office outlet. The information is
then forwarded over ISDN (Integrated System Digital Network) or other communication service,
to databases on a set of central Correspondence Servers at the Fujitsu Services data centres.
This is undertaken by a messaging transport system within the Transaction Management
Service (TMS). Various systems then transfer information to Central Servers that control the

flow of information to various support services. Details of outlet transactions are normally sent
at least daily via the system. Details are then forwarded daily via a file transfer service to the
Post Office accounting department at Chesterfield and also, where appropriate, to other Post
Office Clients.

An audit of all information handled by the TMS is taken daily by copying all new messages to
archive.media. This creates a record of all original outlet transaction details including its origin
- outlet and counter, when it happened, who caused it to happen and the outcome. The TMS
journal is maintained at each of the Fujitsu Services Data Centre sites and is created by
securely replicating all transaction records that occurred in every Outlet. They therefore provide
the ability to compare the audit track record of the same transaction recorded in two places to
verify that systems were operating correctly. All exceptions are investigated and reconciled.
Records of all transactions are written to audit archive media.

The system clock incorporated into the desktop application on the counter visual display units
is configured to indicate local time. This has been the situation at (INSERT PO), Branch Code
(INSERT) since (INSTALLATION DATE) when the Horizon system was introduced at that
particular Post Office.

The Horizon system records time in GMT and takes no account of Civil Time Displacements,
thus during British Summer Time (BST) (generally the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday
in October), system record timings are shown in GMT — one hour earlier than local time (BST).

There was, however, one exception which related to the category of transactions ‘Transfer In’
where events recorded in the Transaction Logs, were shown in local time. This meant that
during the designated summer months ‘Transfer In’ log entries were recorded in BST instead
of GMT and showed a one hour forward displacement in time from other transactions being
recorded in the logs. This anomaly was corrected during the winter months prior to BST 2005
since when ‘Transfer In’ log entries have been recorded in GMT, consistent with all other
transactions being recorded in the logs.

Continuation of statement of Penelope Anne Thomas

When information relating to individual transactions is requested, the data is extracted from the
audit archive media via the Audit Workstations (AW’s). Information is presented in exactly the
same way as the data held in the archive although it can be filtered depending upon the type of
information requested. The integrity of audit data is guaranteed at all times from its origination,
storage and retrieval to subsequent despatch to the requester. Controls have been
established that provide assurances to Post Office Internal Audit (POIA) that this integrity is

maintained.

During audit data extractions the following controls apply :

1.. Extractions can only be made through the AWs which exist at Fujitsu Services,
Lovelace Lane, Bracknell, Berkshire and Fujitsu Services, Sackville House, Brooks
Close, Lewes, East Sussex. These sites are both subject to rigorous physical security
controls appropriate to each location. All AWs are located in a secure room subject to
proximity pass access within a secured Fujitsu Services site.

2. Logical access to the AW and its functionality is managed in accordance with the
Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account Security Policy and the principles of ISO 17799.
This includes dedicated:Logins, password control and the use of Microsoft Windows NT
security features.

3. All extractions are logged on the AW and supported by documented Audit Record
Queries (ARQ’s), authorised by nominated persons within Post Office Ltd. This log can
be scrutinised on the AW.

Extractions are only made by authorised individuals.
Upon receipt of an ARQ from Post Office Ltd they are interpreted by CS Security. The
details are checked and the printed request filed.

6. The required files are identified and marked using the dedicated audit tools.
Checksum seals are calculated for audit data files when they are written to audit
archive media and re-calculated when the files are retrieved.

8. To assure the integrity of the audit data while on the audit archive media the checksum
seal for the file is re-calculated by the Audit Track Sealer and compared to the original
