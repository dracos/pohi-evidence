Hi Lucy,

Yes, that is correct. The solution that Rod agreed with Royal Mail’s lawyer was that they would verbally
share any relevant extract from those audit reports and if Rod thinks it is applicable, then he would have to
subpoena them to release the reports to Post Office. I am not sure where Rod got to with this.

Best regards,

Johann

I recall discussing this previously with Rod, is it correct that all audit reports pre-2011 are in Royal Mail's possession

and not yours?
Kind regards,

Hi Lucy,

Apologies for the late reply, but I was on leave yesterday.

Ernst & Young were the external auditors for Post Office and RMG going back about 30 years. Therefore, it
would have been Ernst & Young who audited Horizon pre 2011. Hope this helps.

Best regards,

Hi Johann,

I hope you are well.

I have a question for you as part of the Post Office Group Litigation.

Do you know who audited Horizon prior to Ernst & Young (i.e. pre-2011)?

If you could come back to me ASAP today that would be great.

Kind regards,

Lucy
