Dear Mr Hill,
Thank you for your email about the BBC Panorama programme.

I can fully understand that the programme gave you concerns but I must assure you that the allegations made
against the Post Office in the programme are at odds with the facts and were based on partial, selective and
inaccurate information.

We are, of course, sorry if a small number of people feel that they have not been treated fairly in the past but
we have gone to enormous lengths to re-investigate their cases. We will not discuss these cases in public,
particularly while the Criminal Cases Review Commission is conducting a review of a number of cases, which
we believe it should be allowed to complete without external comment. We also gave a commitment of
confidentiality to people who put forward cases to us for reinvestigation.

The Post Office has, however, issued a statement in response to the programme and this is on our website at
[link]. I hope this provides useful information for you.

We have never said Horizon is perfect but it is robust and effective, used by our postmasters and their staff to
process six million transactions at 11,500 Post Offices every day. With [xxxx] people working in our network
there are, regrettably, occasions when mistakes are made at the counter and I am sorry to hear that you
experienced a problem with a cheque deposit. If you wish me to look into this further for you I will be pleased
to do so.

T hope this response is helpful.

Yours sincerely

Just bringing this up to top of your inbox - probably need Rod’s sign off although all cleared lines. I am going to use as
basis for the abusive letters trickling through (the ones that we can answer)

I might take out the final part re offering to look into his cheque problem as remembered he put this on a blog about
three years ago so a bit late to investigate his complaint. Looks like we cocked up an ISA payment but it was all put
right and we paid him £50 goodwill.

Scroll down to see email from David Hill (appears to be a customer) and note his copy list. I was going to send
response below — given he has referred to short pre-Pano piece on subspace and not our full statement I think I
should essentially just send him the latter.

Do you think I should also use his cc list?

Dear Communications team,

I watched tonight's Panorama with interest. I note that you use the words "damaging and unsubstantiated"
in you recent communication in SUBSPACE news (see below)

It is my view, after watching the programme that Post Office should reflect on these words carefully, it would
appear that "damaging and unsubstantiated" were the actions that Post Office took against some of its former
sub postmasters.

The evidence being presented by Panorama, with respect to making charges of Theft in order to secure losses
from sub postmasters, have made me ponder as to who should be held accountable for theft. Surely there is a
clear debate to be had, as to whether Post Office have indeed been dishonest in securing financial gain by using
a false charge, in order to achieve this (make it less complicated !!).

Tam not a lawyer so I cannot tell, but I sincerely hope that justice wins in the end for whatever was real and
honest in this national scandal.

Thave real concerns from my own dealings with Post office at my local branch in Astwood Bank, who were
affected by this tactic. I deposited a cheque for £2,200 and was credited with almost twice that sum. The
system, whatever that was (I understand it was Horizon), was clearly at fault in some way or another.

In my view Post Offices behaviour has been appalling and needs to be brought to justice. I can only hope that
this happens soon, whilst currently remain puzzled as to why this is taking so long.

As you may know, the BBC plans to broadcast a Panorama programme tonight (Monday 17 August) on our
Horizon system.

We expect it to include damaging and unsubstantiated allegations about the system and the Post Office’s
approach to prosecutions.

We categorically reject the allegations that have been put to us.

If you have any questions about this issue please email them to
