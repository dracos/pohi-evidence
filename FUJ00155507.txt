Andy,

I've not been liaising with Pete in recent months as he'd moved to another role.

All liaisons have been via Penny.

We have also transferred our work (3rd November) to the POL Security Team in Salford (Jane Owen has taken over).

I associate contact details for your information.

Security Team - for info.

Regards,

Dave Posnett

Hi Dave,
With your pending move and Pete's departure I thought it best to let you know that I will be taking over all of Pete's responsibilities
from the middle of December. With this in mind could you copy me in any correspondence that you would have sent Pete in the

past. And inform me of who will be running this from the POL side going forward.
Any questions please ring..

Andy Dunks
