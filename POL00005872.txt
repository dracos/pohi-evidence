Dear all

To support our aim to improve conformance in the network, we have developed a
‘branch standards’ booklet which will go out to all subpostmasters, franchisees
and multiple partners early next week. The branch standards booklet will serve
as a useful reminder to branches about the things they need to do to run their
branch efficiently and compliantly, and is divided into four sections:

Providing a great service
Selling products compliantly
Managing cash in your branch
Working efficiently

Accompanying the branch standards booklet will be a covering letter and short
conformance booklet that outlines the steps we will be taking if some of these
branch standards are not met. The steps include:

Continuing to withhold remuneration for non compliant bureau de change
transactions

Recovering the costs of any additional training that we have to provide if a
branch is not completing valid cash declarations, or completing compliance
training on time.

Recovering the cost of missing motor vehicle licence (MVL) discs

Here is a PDF of the branch standards booklet and the conformance booklet.

Branches will also start receiving a scorecard showing their performance
against some of the branch standards, so they can identify areas where they
need to improve. The first scorecard will be included with the branch standards
booklet, and an example is shown on the inside back cover.

Next week you will receive a hard copy of the branch standards booklet and
conformance booklet (either to your home or work address, depending on the
details we have available for you). We're sending copies to the majority of
colleagues in the network team, to those that contributed to developing the
booklet, and to those teams that may be impacted by the booklet going out. We
will also be developing a communications approach for adapting and cascading
these messages for the Crown network.

Many thanks
