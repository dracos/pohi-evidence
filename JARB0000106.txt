Daniel Kawczynski MP
House of Commons
London SW1A OAA

Thank you for your letter of 9 February regarding your constituent and involvement in the
Post Office Horizon issues. You ask a very pertinent question — how to maintain a
coordinated approach to this very thorny problem. As I am standing down at the next
election Kevan Jones MP has kindly offered to lead on this and so your office ought to get in
touch with his office and register your interest.

T have lost faith with the Mediation Scheme and indeed the Post Office who seem to me to
be running in almost exactly the opposite direction to that intended at the outset of this
process. My own constituent remains in the Scheme — which in her case has ground to a
shuddering halt — but she is in close contact with the Justice for SubPostmasters Alliance
run by the splendid Alan Bates, and I could think of no better place to send your constituent
than there: http://www.jfsa.org.uk/. I understand that they are considering a class action
lawsuit.

If I think of anything else I will let you know but I hope you will continue to campaign on
behalf of your constituent. The Post Office has acted abominably and seems not to
comprehend this in the slightest.
