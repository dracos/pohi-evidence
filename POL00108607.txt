1. Introduction and context @

We are in a challenging position with the Scheme — our session is aimed at assessing all
options openly and frankly.

Whatever decisions are made by the sub-committee, we believe that we can develop and deliver
communications and stakeholder approaches which will manage and respond to adverse publicity
and reaction. However, we do recommend a specific option

We have developed communications approaches for all the options set out here.

We have engaged a senior PR professional to work solely on Sparrow over the next three months
and are in discussions with Brunswick PR.

Post Office Board/Chair has asked for:

+ Consideration be given to changes that could be made within the existing ToR
+ Whether the caseload could be “triaged” to allow the caseload to be minimised
+ Steps to be taken to settle case M022

Sub Committee has asked for the following to be developed:

+ Animplementation plan following their agreement in principle to PO “taking control” of
the Scheme

+ Linklaters letter, drawing on the further Deloitte assurance work, for potential use in
the context of this plan

James Arbuthnot MP has written to the Post Office Chief Executive to:
+ Express concerns over how long the Scheme and investigations are taking

+ Request a draft letter for MPs and a meeting in July to update MPs on Scheme
progress

Introduction and context @

What does success look like?

We bring a close to the discussion on the Horizon IT system as there is no evidence
there are systemic issues with it (independent assurance provided)

150 applicants feel that their concerns have been addressed

MPs and the media are interested in our strategy and modernisation as opposed to
our IT systems

In run up to the election the Horizon issue does not cause the minister any problems

We can proactive to changes in our IT systems and ensure they are received
positively

Limited internal resource (from chairman to administration)/money spent on Horizon
and more on profit-making activity

Second Sight no longer producing poor quality work that POL cannot rebut publicly

Existing subpostmasters and customers continue to have confidence in our systems
and processes, particularly in relation to digital and financial services development

POL00108607

POL00108607
Principle concerns @

+ Mounting cost and use of management time

+ Potential for Scheme to continue until the end of 2015 (if Second Sight submit three cases a week)

+ JFSA and Second Sight are increasingly taking a harder line — in the case of JFSA escalating to Ministers and
threatening to go to media

+ Governance of Scheme as constituted does not allow Post Office any ability to amend approach in best
interests of the Business and applicants

+ Second Sight’s reports are of poor quality and inflammatory and will become public (with no opportunity for
Post Office to rebut)

+ Prospect of sustained media and stakeholder activity (possibly to tie into election sensitivities)

+ Controversial cases and high profile decisions on a monthly basis, plus one off adverse media/stakeholder
reaction when process completed

+ Due to Conditional Fee Agreements there is an increasing likelihood of sub-postmasters entering detrimental
financial arrangements

+ Potential impact the continuation of the Scheme could have on confidence in the business

+ This is all in the context of:

+ Post Office having very limited legal liability, based on the Linklaters report

+ Further evidence of there being no systemic issue with the Horizon computer system through the Deloitte
report and the results of 26 Post Office investigations ro

Press for a number of reforms to its operation:

+ Criminal cases: Make clear we will investigate last and are unlikely to mediate

+ Bankruptcy: only engage if the Official Receiver has agreed to assign the rights

+ Old cases: do not investigate where data is not available

2. Options and recommendation @

iii. Completing the Post Office investigation in each case and moving the
Mediation Scheme in-house

Risks:
+ Highly likely to lead to criticism of Post Office in national media
+ May cause applicants to abandon the Scheme in favour of litigation

+ Removes independent element from process

+ Increased risk (in the short term) of parliamentary scrutiny
+ Adverse ministerial and stakeholder reaction

+ Irreparable damage to relations with JFSA

These are all risks which are likely to materialise in any event and under any option. This
option, we believe, gives us the opportunity to manage these risks more effectively.

Approach of a confident organisation.

POL00108607

2. Options and recommendation @

It is the view of the Programme, Legal and Communications and Corporate Affairs teams
that Option iii, where we move the Scheme in-house is the option most likely to meet the
needs of the Business.

We take this view in the light of the following:
The inquiry into the allegations raised by the JFSA and MPs was set up in summer 2012.

There has been no evidence in the two year period since of any systemic issue with the
Horizon computer system, the central contention of the allegations.

Alongside increasing costs (with £3.2m already spent on the programme), we now have
a body of evidence and other factors which suggest that we should amend the approach
taken — while ensuring that all applicants have their cases heard.

We could expend time, energy and cost pursuing a process which results in the
applicants and stakeholders being more dissatisfied at the end than they were at the
beginning.

3. Comms plan, narrative & stakeholder handling @

Proposal

We publish a report in July on Horizon and the Mediation Scheme, including the
Linklaters letter and the Deloitte report. We disband the working group and end Second
Sight involvement. Pledge to investigate all the cases.

Narrative and media line to take

As a responsible business the Post Office is committed to listening and learning from its
people. As such in 2012, following allegations raised with us by some subpostmasters,
we set up an inquiry into the Horizon computer system. We appointed an independent
firm, Second Sight, to lead this inquiry.

In the two years since the inquiry began there has been no evidence of deficiencies with
the Horizon system. Indeed, Second Sight found no systemic issues in its report in 2013.
It has since been investigating cases and this work supports this finding.

We have also commissioned Deloitte to examine the Horizon system further and
received assurance around the integrity of the system, which has around 68,000 users
and deals with more than six million transactions every day.

3. Comms plan, narrative & stakeholder handling @

As part of our commitment to investigate cases raised with us by a small number of
subpostmasters we set up a Mediation Scheme in order to offer an opportunity for them
to have their cases heard. At the same time we launched a Branch Support Programme
to find ways of improving the support we offer the subpostmaster community.

Having fully investigated 26 of the 70 cases submitted, it has now become clear that few
of the cases submitted to us raise genuine issues with the Horizon computer system.
The mediation scheme will not therefore work in the interests of those who have
submitted cases.

We have therefore decided to move to a new approach.

We will investigate all cases and provide applicants with a report of their investigation to
help them understand what happened in their case.

When all investigations are completed we will consider what action is appropriate in
individual cases and what improvements can be made in the light of any findings.

This is consistent with the approach we have taken with the Second Sight Interim Report
through our Brach Support Programme.

We will publish a report when all investigations have been completed.

Stakeholder

Key Message/handling

Minister

Value for money considerations and potential play into general election timing

The longer the scheme runs, and the more dissatisfied applicants emerge, the greater the
risk of calls for a public inquiry and BIS select committee involvement.

MPs with cases could find themselves facing criticism where cases are not resolved in a
way which satisfies applicant.

Right thing for the business at time of massive change.

LL and Deloitte independent assurance/possible further independent role

Role for NFSP?

Duty of care to existing subpostmasters (and applicants - expectation gap)

If we continue the next 9 months will be littered with local negative stories
Protection against SS quality of work.

Independence remains in mediation process through respected mediators CEDR
All applicants will receive the full investigation report.

Legal options remain open to dissatisfied applicants.

In relation to Ministerial handling, other factors to consider are:

+ Discuss possible role with NFSP

+ Post Office takes lead in media handling

+ Plan communications opportunities for the minister
* Timing of announcement

+ Network Transformation factors in key MP areas

* Consider independent oversight by a third party

These factors could mitigate difficult communications factors and ease handling.

Stakeholder

Key Message/handling

Media

Now to summer: Allegation of white wash by POL resulting in 1-2 days media coverage
(poss BBC, Computer Weekly as well as nationals such as Mirror, Mail as well as regional
print and broadcast) This will be drive by and include quotes from JFSA, MPs and
Applicants

Over the summer: Potential for media coverage driven by any Fol placed by JFSA on cost
of the scheme.

Summer - Christmas: Possible regional and national stories by those who continue to
follow the story e.g BBC and Computer Weekly and regionals

Run up to election: Potential remains for follow up around any announcement on IT&C
contract. Though hopefully story becoming of less interest in this scenario as no live cases.

4. Media handling @

Holding line for media

We have decided to make changes to the approach to this issue in the best
interests of applicants and the Post Office business.

We are committed to investigating all cases. It would be inappropriate to
comment on individual cases. We have confidence in the Horizon computer
system and this has been further consolidated through independent verification
which has repeatedly shown no systemic issues within it.

We have published a report setting out the position we have reached and will
publish a final report at the end of the Scheme.

This approach would attract some media coverage from outlets which have previously
covered the issue (last July it was covered in a 12 hour cycle by the BBC, with the most
high profile being the Today Programme and BBC News at 10. This would be a one day
news cycle.

Annex E: Horizon definitions @

At the Board’s request we examined the impact of the Horizon definition on the cases where we have received
detailed case questionnaire responses (70 cases). We used the definitions below:

+ Core Horizon — ghost transactions; power/telecoms issues; recovery process; lost data; Horizon terminal/hardware
failures; remote access to Horizon

+ - Branch operating issues — cash and stock remittances; synchronisation with client systems; other hardware failures
(eg. pinpad/lottery/etc); branch accounting practices; ATMs; paystation;

+ Support - training; NBSC / HSD support; lack of investigation team; lack of audit trail; allocation of risk; access to
Horizon data; proof of errors

+ + Other — NT payments / branch relocations / issues with previous SPMRs / anything else

Results:

+ 30 of the 70 have raised core horizon issues

+ 59 of the 70 have referenced branch operating issues (38 of these cases do not mention core horizon issues).
+ 67 of the 70 have raised support issues (only 2 cases relate to support issues only).

+ 20 cases are criminal.

+ 38 refer to incidents that occurred prior to 2007

We also examined the history of the wider Horizon definition and found it has been in use since 2012. Given this
we do not recommend using this approach to reduce the caseload facing the Scheme.

Annex F: Tony Hooper @

The programme team have considered Tony Hooper's likely positioning in relation to
the Scheme and any possible modifications. In summary the team believe:

+ That Tony will not remain as Chair of a radically modified Scheme if Post Office
take Control.

+ That Tony will not assist Post Office if it looks to disband the Working Group and
end Second Sight’s engagement

+ That he is unlikely to take a public stance against Post Office .

* That he believes that Post Office should accept that the Scheme will take around
18 months and that is normal for a Scheme of this type.

+ That as Chair he will maintain the Status Quo rather than managing conflict
necessary to redesign the Scheme.

Annex G: JFSA @

Despite having collaborated with them since summer 2012 and given them
prominent role they stance against post office continues to harden

+ AB has said that he is still looking for a public enquiry

+ He has said he has not confidence that post office are going to act in good faith
at mediation

+ He has said he is expecting to see evidence of post offices willingness to pay
large sums of money

+ He said he is continuing to gather and use FOI and other channels to gain
evidence against post office

Summary

After 2 years of post office working closely with JFSA we have not been to establish
credibility with him. This position is likely to deteriorate over the course of the
scheme regardless of the option post office chooses

* They are expensive (60K pcm)
