Susan

I have no required format for you, I think we need to summarise Ron’s Proposal into 1 page. For me the key headings
are:

1. Proposal Summary — ie an dependant review of past fraud cases

2. Scope of the reviews (Ron's bullet points on slide 2)

3. Approach (slide 5)

4. Benefits — why we think this might help us — eg provide MPs with an independent assessment to address their
concerns & understand anything we need to address.

5. Background on 2" Sight and a bit about Ron and his buddy.

6. Cost — unfortunately this seems to be time and material — but we should say this.

I'm also hoping to have a proposal from Deloittes sometime this evening which I will also bring to the meeting
tomorrow.

In the mean time Alice has asked for a Tor for the work that Ron et al are going to do — Simon I can probably pull that
together if you can let me have a template to use.

Susan, Lesley

Attached is Ron's proposal.

My view is that we make it clear to Alice/Paula the distinction between the work Ron is proposing (an independent
review of past cases) and the Horizon Forensic Audit (the Deloitte's proposal) and put it one the agenda to discuss
tomorrow.
