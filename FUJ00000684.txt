PATHWAY APPROVAL DATE POCL APPROVAL DATE

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF IMPACT ASSESSMENTS:
ICL Pathway agrees that the proposal as documented in the Single Point of Contact
Specification Document, version 1.5, dated 12 July 2001 is a technically viable
working option. It should be noted that this document is still being developed for full
agreement between ICL Pathway and POCL. Thus there are a few points to note:
1. The described 'tromboning ' effect could have serious implications on the
availability of telephone lines into the helpdesk to accept postmaster service
calls. ICL Pathway has sized the requirement for additional outbound trunk lines
to alleviate the ttomboning problem that would be seen on a typical day. ICL
Pathway agrees to the following statement proposed by POCL in response to
CCN777a.
“POCL will not be entitled to any right or remedy under the Codified Agreement in
respect of failure by ICL Pathway to achieve any Service Level to the extent that
failure was caused by the provision and/or use of the SPoC tromboning effect and,
to that extent, all Service Level measurements giving rise to such failures shall be
disregarded for the purposes of calculating or assessing such rights or remedies.

In the event of any such failure, ICL Pathway will use reasonable endeavours to
demonstrate to POCL that that failure (and the extent to which that failure) was
caused by such provision or use.”

2. ICL Pathway notes that the solution for redirected calls between the two
helpdesks is still being evaluated, as described in Section 13 of the Specification
Document.

3. Change is required to the ICL Pathway business continuity plans due to the
introduction of SPoC. These changes include updating the business continuity
tests, documents and schedules to specifically include the SPoC.

4. We confirm that ICL Pathway will not pick-up any additional costs or charges
above that of its current solution. There are two scenarios whereby ICL Pathway
will recover additional telephone call costs from POCL.

i. The postmaster has contacted the HSH in error and the HSH redirects the
call
ii. The postmaster has contacted the HSH who have partly dealt with the

CCN No: 777 Page: 1

FUJ00000684
FUJ00000684
call but then need to pass it on to the NBSC.

In each case once the call is redirected to the NBSC via the speed dial number
at the HSH, the line costs coming into the HSH and the line costs going to the
NBSC (as the line coming in will be in use whilst the NBSC resolves the query),
will be recovered from POCL. It is proposed that these costs be reported monthly
and invoiced quarterly.

5. ICL Pathway notes that the specification document will be updated with a jointly
agreed implementation plan.

The proposed change impacts the CSR+ HSH PPD (CS/PRO/0092) V3.0. This
document will need amending in Sections 3 and 4, including a diagram, to describe
the new SPoC.

HSH staff will need to be trained and their handsets updated with the speed dial for
the NBSC referrals.

ISD have already made extensive use of one of their Telecomms Specialists who
has reviewed and commented on the PON Specification Documents and attended a
joint meeting with PON.

OVERALL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: HIGH MEDIUM LOW

REASON FOR CHANGE:

The CR is to move towards the PON vision of one number for outlets to gain help,
advice and support in their day to day business transactions.

DETAILS OF CHANGE:

PON wish to move from two helpdesk telephone numbers to one utilising their NBSC
as a SPoC utilising a BT Intelligent Call Router (ICR) system to route the callers to
either the HSH or NBSC depending on the type of enquiry, to enable a seamless
operation.

PROPOSED REVISION TO WORDING OF CODIFIED AGREEMENT:

G10, 4.3 additional paragraph

Telephone answering SLAs will be measured from the point the redirected
telephone call enters the HSH telephone switch.

G01, 6.12.1 The Horizon System Helpdesk contact point for the Single Point of
Contact (SPoC) shall be a local rate telephone number.

A01, Definition of SPoC and what it means in terms of the contract to be proposed
by POCL and agreed by ICL Pathway.

Charging Mechanism:

Where cost estimates are included, these are quoted as a mid-point estimate of the
work to be carried out by ICL Pathway. The eventual charge will be made on an
‘actuals’ Time and Materials basis using the same man-rates. A 20% contingency
has been included in the CCN to allow for reasonable variation around the mid-point
estimate. The estimate is set so that the ICL eventual charge is as likely to be lower
as higher than the estimate excluding contingency. The contingency is included to
provide allowable headroom for invoicing purposes against a purchase order. Above
this level, ICL Pathway would have to apply for additional approval via a new CCN.

Action Messages

Action Number: 1 Date Apr 12 2001 10:29:43 By: Lisa Morcom (Change Management)
CHANGE CONTROL:Extension to 24/4/01 for CR RO106 agreed at JCCB 11/4/01.

Action Number: 1 Date Apr 25 2001 13:47:22 By: Ken Westfield

2001. P Westfiel would then comment in following week. Extension requested on 23rd April 2001 to 11th May

Action Number: 3 Date Jun 6 2001 08:59:23 By: Alison Clarke (Change Management)

CCB DECISION (MTG No. 166) - DECISION: SUBMIT CCN 05/06/01 CCN 777, raised in response to
CRO106, had initially been rejected by POCL, but had been updated (CCN 777a) and was presented to CCB by
P Westfield. CCB were informed that the technical documentation had now been received from POCL and the
CCN reissued and that it was believed to be viable to proceed. P Westfield cited a neutral impact on Pathway
with no cost increase. It was stated that POCL's preferred carrier was BT but that Pathway might want to
retain the ability to move this to another carrier as required.Concern was also raised about POCL changing the
TVR at will and redirecting calls from NBSC to HSH to cover excessive calls. S Muchow suggested that this
should be covered by change control. S Muchow suggested that the wording of points 1 & 2 oft he Summary of
Impact Assessments in the CCN should be altered. P Jeram questioned whether the costs shown in the
Business Case were accurate. CCB approve for submission with the following actions: 1.P Westfield to refine
the CCN on advisement from S Muchow. 2. P Westfield/Change Management to address/revise costs shown.

3. Commercial to advise on appropriate change control e.g. CCD or not.
