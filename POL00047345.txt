was ended, A room was made available at Bransholme Police station where at 13:27 hours, the
interview recommenced. Miss Skinner refused legal representation throughout the course of
the interview. I now produce form CS001, Legal Rights forms as item DM1.

26/04/2006 to 25/05/2006 which I now produce as item DM3. Miss Skinner confirmed that she

had produced these Trading statements and that it was her signature on the documents.

Miss Skinner signed the master tape seals numbered 043366, 043367 and 043368, which!
now produce as item DM14. The interview was concluded at 15:32 hours. The tapes used with
the faulty tape machine were signed with seal numbers 043407 and 043409 which I now
produce as item DM15 I have prepared a typed summary of the tape recorded interview which

I now produce as item DM16.

Following the interview, data provided by Fujitsu Services, who operate the Horizon Computer
system was obtained and analysed. I now produce the data discs as DM4 for data January

2006 and May 2006.
From the data I produced a series of schedules showing:

> The transfers of cash between stock units at North Bransholme Post Office,
> The cash declarations made on stock unit cc,
> The rollover of stock units at the end of a Branch Trading Period

> Asummary of events on stock unit cc.

These schedules were compiled for two peri ods covering Trading Period 10 ending 25"
January 2006 and Trading Period 02 ending 25" May 2006. The schedule for transfer of cash
between stock units has 11 columns, ID being the actual computer position used to undertake
the transaction. User being the individual user attached to the system. Stock Unit (SU), being
the individual stock which the transactions were performed on. Time being time the
transaction was completed. Sessionid being the unique identifying number given to each
transaction by Horizon at the start of the session. Txnld being the unique identifying number

given to each transaction by Horizon at the end of the session. Mode being either TO for
Transfer out of the stock unit or TI for transfer into the stock unit. Product number being the
identifying code given to each item available at a Post Office either as a transaction to
customers or a function of the stock units for example code 6276 is the identifying code for a
transfer in transaction, Code 6277 for a transfer out and code 1 for cash. Quantity for number

of. Sale value is the amount in £'s and pence.

I now produce the schedule of transfers involving stock units for January 2006 as item DM5
and for May 2006 as DM9.

The summary of Cash Declarations has 8 columns, Group ID is the branch code which identify’s
a Post Office, North Bransholme being 174321. ID, Date, Time, User and Stock User (SU) as
detailed above. EPOSSTransaction.T being the Horizon system event undertaken, in this case a
cash declaration. EPOSSTransaction.T! being the Outcome this being a declaration completed
with a discrepancy in the amount declared to what the system derived as being required to

balance the stock unit.

I now produce the schedule of Cash declarations made on CC stock unit for January 25" 2006
as item DM6 and for 24" May 2006 as item DM10.

The summary of Stock Rollovers has the same 8 column headings as the Cash Declaration
schedule as detailed above. The rollover of a stock unit from one Trading Period into the next is
completed when all required summaries and declarations have been made and the person
undertaking the balance is satisfied the details are an accurate reflection of the cash, stock on
hand and transactions performed. The date reflects the date undertaken and could be after the

Trading Period end if the rollover of the stock unit is undertaken the following day.

Continuation of statement of DIANE SARAH MATTHEWS

I now produce the schedule of Stock Rollovers for Trading Period 10, 25th January 2006 as
itern DM7 and for Trading Period 2, 24th May 2006 as DM11.

The summary of Events for Stock Unit CC again has the same 8 column headings as in the
previous 2 schedules detailed overleaf. This shows all reports requested by the user, all

declarations made and any rollover completed.

I now produce the schedule of the Summary of Events for Trading Period 10 ending 25"
January 2006 as item DM8 and for Trading Period 2 ending 24" May 2006 as item DM12.

The accounting paperwork for trading period 02, ending 24" May 2006 was obtained and the
cash declarations made on CC stock unit were examined. It was noted that two declarations
were entered within a four minute period varying in the total declared by £15,466.60. I now

produce these cash declaration printouts as item DM13.

It should be noted that the times on the schedules for January are correct, however the times
onthe schedules for May are 1 hour behind. This is due to archived data being saved in GMT .

I analysed the data on the schedules produced. Stock unit CC was used as a place solely to
record shortages . This was so that they did not interfere with the balancing of the main

counter stock unit AA.

Stock unit AA was used to serve customers on a daily basis and from which, all staff logged
onto at the same time as it was setup as a shared stock unit. This also means that the cash and
stock in each draw was used by all staff and was not segregated. Stock unit BB was rarely used

and only when there was any problems with Stock Unit AA.

Continuation of statement of DIANE SARAH MATTHEWS,

The staff present at the end of the day would produce reports and make declarations into
stock unit AA without any shortage being highlighted. At the end of a trading period, the cash
would be declared with any significant shortages being transferred from AA or BB into Stock

Unit CC prior to the account being produced.

The system derived cash total within CC stock was declared as a record of cash being present in
that stock unit. However there was no cash present in this stock unit and a nil figure should
have been declared which would have revealed a shortage in the accounts produced.

By using this method the branch accounts were shown to be balanced and correct for each
Trading Period. If all the shortages had been declared correctly, and stock unit CC showed a nil

cash balance, the branch accounts would have reflected these shortages.

For example if any one of the stock units balanced short by £500, the branch accounts would
show a £500 deficit in the cash figure. By transferring this £500 into an empty stock unit, then
declaring that this stock unit holds £500 in cash, the branch accounts would show no deficit.

Therefore as the accounts were showing a balance each and every trading period this would

not trigger any problems which would require further investigation by Post Office Ltd.

on 24" May 2006 stock unit CC declared that £40,253.85 in cash was present. When the audit
was undertaken on 31* May 2006 there was a further discrepancy of £18,688.56 discovered in
the cash. This makes a total cash shortage of £58,942.41 between what the branch stated was

present and the actual amount of cash held at the branch.
