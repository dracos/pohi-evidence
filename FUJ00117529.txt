Activity & Screen Flows OO
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 26-NovSJan-034,

1 Introduction

This document describes the changes to the Counter Dialogues for the LFS application
resulting from the introduction of E2E Release I at the Post Officer counter (at BI3 $60). The
LFS counter dialogues (prior to the introduction of E2E Release 1 cards) are informally
described in (LF/DES/003). This document will describe the changes to the flow of activities,
screen displays and prompts, and receipt layouts at the counter described in the above
document as a result of the introduction of E2E Release 1.

Note:

E Release 1 is also, and more recently, known as ‘Impact Release 1”,

1.1 Scope

Those screens that are not affected by the introduction of E2E Release 1 are not included in
this document.

Note that the primary purpose of the flow charts in this document is to define the Counter
Dialogue, and in particular, to define the sequence of screens displayed. They are not
intended to be definitive statements of the low-level design of the counter application.

This is a delta document that only describes changes incurred as a result of the
implementation of E2E Release 1. However, since there is no previous LFS counter
dialogues document, then this document will form the baseline should any further changes to
LFS dialogues be required.

Itis felt that standard dialogues that show progress (for example: ‘Print in progress’) or show
failure of peripherals would simply confuse the readability of this document. Therefore, not
all of the possible error or exception conditions are shown or described within the diagrams
and dialogues within this document.

1.2 Structure of this document
This document is structured as follows:

Section 2 provides the list of unique counter dialogues that are supported for LFS (BI3 $60).
For each dialogue, there is a top-level flow chart, which references further common sequences
as necessary.

Section 3 provides the layout of the Office and Customer receipts for those receipts that have
changed as a result of E2E Release I LFS functionality.

Section 4 lists the unique screens that are supported by LFS, and defines the type of data that
appears on each screen.

Section 5 contains details of new messages/receipt text and help text.

2 LFS Counter Dialogue

The transaction flows in this section show the points at which screens are displayed to the
Clerk. These screens are used to inform and prompt the Clerk at appropriate steps in the

process of each transaction. The flow charts cover both Remittance-Out and collection of
Cash and also the Delivery and Remittance-in of Cash.
2.1 Overview Description

‘This document describes the Counter Dialogues that are required to support the End to End
Release I Projects 3. In summary, this includ

a The Delivery of Cash Pouches to Branches and the automated Remittance-in of the
cash

Packing of Notes and Coins into Pouches

Identifying Groups of Cash Pouches in preparation for Collection

Destroying packed Pouches that contain Cash before the Pouch is Collected
Confirmation of Cash Pouch Collection

oooe

211 Pouch Delivery

This function already exists as a Counter Dialogue but will be enhanced as part of E2E
Release I such that the value of the Cash Pouch delivered to the Branch will be automatically
remitted-in to the Branch accounts. The changes involve the printing of the remittance advice
receipts at the point of delivery and also cater for the erroneous occasions where the Branch
system does not have advance information related to the contents of each Cash Pouch.

2.1.2 Pack Pouches (Remit Out ADC)

This existing dialogue will change such that additional validation is performed that will
ensure that Notes, Coins and stock items can only be packed into the correct type of Pouch.
This will involve changes to the Menu Hierarchy and will require additional error messages to
cater for invalid combinations of Pouch and contents.

2.1.3. Prepare Collection

This new function will allow Stock and Cash Pouches to be grouped together into a logical
“Sack’ ready for collection. Pouch bar-codes will either be scanned or manually entered to
identify which ones belong to the group. Following the creation or update of the Group, two
copies of the Collection Note are printed.

2.1.4 — Reverse Cash Pouch

Since Cash Pouch contents cannot be modified following packing, a new function is required
to ‘Destroy’ the Pouch and return the contents to the Till (Stock Unit). This new dialogue
allows a Cash Pouch to be identified for Destruction/Reversal via scanning of the Bar-code or
manual entry of the Bar-code number. The reversal of a pouch for which a Collection Note
has already been printed will force re-print of the Collection Note (2 copies). Stock pouches
cannot be reversed.

2.15 Pouch Despatch

The existing dialogue has variously been known as ‘Bar-code Scan Carrier’ and ‘Confirm
Pouch Collection’. A new dialogue will be created for the Collection of Pouch Collection

Groups. This will, dependent on type of Branch, require the scan (or manual entry) of a valid
and current Authorised Collectors Card (ACC card). A Liability Transfer Receipt will be
produced on completion of the Pouch Despatch function.

3 Receipts

This section depicts the layout of the LFS remittance receipts following the introduction of
requirements introduced by the Automated Remittances Conceptual design
PSO/S60/E2E/DES/001 (Fujitsu reference BD/CDE/003). The Remittance In Slip and the
Remittance Out Slip are enhanced to include the Pouch/Coin Advice Note Number when the
remittance is for Cash, A new Liability Transfer Receipt will be printed following the
completion of the Pouch Despatch function

It should be noted that the examples below do not necessarily reflect the agreed formats of the
LFS Receipts and that changes to layouts depicted below may or may not be incurred by other
influences or requirement changes. For example, there are some changes as a result of
Bureau de Change and the associated large numerical values incurred by this additional
functionality (Please refer to DE/IFS/004).

As a result, not all the character positions and lengths of fields are documented in this section.
Where these are missing, they may be found in SD/DES/005.

If the Replenishment Delivery Notice is not available at the Counter for the Cash Pouch being
Received, then the Total Cash Value within the Pouch must be entered by the Clerk. The
calculator panel above will be used to enter the cash value and then to re-enter the value in
confirmation that the initial figure is correct.

This forces the clerk to enter the cash value twice and a check will subsequently be made to
ensure that the 2 values match. This ensures that any entry mistakes made by the clerk are
captured and rectified since the amount entered cannot be reversed or modified.

The original amount and verified amount are shown on the right-hand part of the screen and
the clerk may switch between them by touching either value.
