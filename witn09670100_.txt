                        POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




           FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF: ANDRZEJ KONRAD BOLC




I, ANDRZEJ KONRAD BOLC, will say as follows:

I make this statement in response to the Rule 9 Request dated 24th October 2023, in

relation to my role at Cartwright King Solicitors (the firm) in the criminal prosecutions

of Khayyam Ishaq, Grant Allen, Angela Sefton and Anne Nield, and working with

Fujitsu Services Ltd (Fujitsu).

Background

1. I graduated from the University of Manchester with a BA (Hons) Degree in

   Economic and Social Studies. I completed the Common Professional

   Examination and Law Society Finals at De Montfort University Leicester. I

   qualified as a solicitor in October 1995, and was accepted onto the Duty Solicitor

   Scheme in London several years later. I have maintained my Duty Solicitor status

   since that time. In April 2008 I was granted Higher Rights of Audience (Criminal

   Proceedings).

                                                                                         WI TN09670100




2. 1 have worked continuously as a Solicitor since qualification. I initially remained

   with the same criminal defence law firm in London at which I had been articled,

   and was employed full time as an assistant solicitor in general crime for this legal

   aid practice. I represented clients at the police station and magistrates court and

   prepared their cases in the crown court. In November 2006 1 joined Cartwright

   King as an assistant solicitor in their Leicester office and was made a senior

   associate shortly afterwards. Having gained my higher rights of audience in

   2008, I spent several years in the firm's Higher Courts Advocacy (HCA)

   department, dealing primarily with plea and sentence hearings at the Crown

   Court. The firm decided to set up a private prosecution department. One of the

   directors of the firm had previously conducted prosecutions on behalf of amongst

   others, the RSPCA, the Environment Agency (fishing licence prosecutions) and

   the Royal Mail Group (the prosecution of postal workers). I was selected to join

   this department. There was no separate training provided for this role as a

   prosecutor, although I would have maintained my professional development

   obligations to undertake 16 hours of training per year. With regard to the work for

   POL I was told that I would be assisted by experienced investigators, and that

   POL regularly instructed Counsel that were familiar with their prosecutions. Aside

   from my involvement with Post Office Limited (POL), I subsequently also

   undertook advocacy for the above organisations on a handful of occasions. I

   have undertaken defence work for the police federation. Whilst at the firm I also

   conducted some education law and ran a small practice in this field alongside my

   criminal defence work. I left the firm in 2022.

                                                                                       WI TN09670100




3. My understanding was that the Royal Mail and Post Office were to become

   separate organisations on the 1st April 2012. That prosecutions for both had up

   until that point been conducted by the Criminal Law Team, Royal Mail Group, but

   upon separation the Post Office needed to create their own department. Rather

   than continue to employ numerous agents around the country to conduct these

   prosecutions, I understood it wanted to use a single firm as much as possible,

   and employed Cartwright King, as Agents, to carry out this work for prosecutions

   in England and Wales. This was to include, but not limited to advice on the

   sufficiency of evidence in relation to charging decisions. Other arrangements

   were to be put in place for Scotland and Northern Ireland. The first "Green jacket"

   files containing cases prepared for prosecution that were sent to me began

   arriving at my office in Leicester around March 2012. From July 2013, in light of

   the publication of the Second Sight Report into the Horizon IT system, which

   disclosed the existence of bugs within it, my involvement shifted towards a review

   process of all previous Royal Mail 1Post Office prosecutions. After a number of

   months, as that process was gradually completed, I was moved onto other work,

   and no longer had any involvement with the Post Office. I was aware that the

   firm continued to have some involvement with the Post Office after that time, but I

   do not know in what capacity, and I am unaware of when any arrangements

   came to an end.

4. My recollection is that cases were referred to Cartwright King by Jarnail Singh. I

   cannot recall if files were initially sent to him from the security team based in

   Salford, or came directly to us.

                                                                                         WI TN09670100




5. I understood that once a case had been raised and was being investigated by a

   security manager, they built a green jacket file containing their report, statements

   and exhibits, including interview transcripts. As far as I can recall, in the cases

   that I dealt with these files were then reviewed by the Business Unit who

   recommended that prosecution should be pursued provided the evidence was

   sufficient to do so (POL00044013). It was at this stage that the file was forwarded

   to Cartwright King for that advice. The report from the investigator included the

   potential offences that they were investigating, and on occasion the offence they

   believed was most appropriate for charging purposes. Once an advice had been

   prepared this was returned to the security team. If the advice was that the

   evidence afforded a realistic prospect of conviction, the file would be forwarded to

   the designated prosecution authority within Post Office Ltd for the authority to

   proceed.



Working with Fujitsu Services Ltd ("Fujitsu")

6. The circumstances in which I had contact with Fujitsu were limited to email

   exchanges I had with Gareth Jenkins for the purpose of obtaining reports

   prepared by him on behalf of Fujitsu with regard to the integrity of the Horizon

   system. I do no recall any direct communication with Penny Thomas although I

   can see from documentation provided to me that she was copied into email

   exchanges between myself and Mr Jenkins, and that I have been copied into

   emails between her and a Post Office security manager (FUJO0156539).

                                                                                        WI TN09670100




7. Gareth Jenkins had previously been used by the Royal Mail Group pre separation

   to give evidence in criminal prosecutions as an expert witness in cases where

   losses had been attributed by the defence to the Horizon system. He had

   prepared general reports on Horizon and Horizon Online Data Integrity, and had

   also been used to prepare reports addressing defence expert reports in specific

   cases. His email footer described him as a Business Applications Architect with

   Fujitsu's Post Office account, so I understood him to have particular expertise in

   relation to the Horizon system.


8. I believe that In-house Counsel had advised on the need for an expert report into

   the integrity of the Horizon system and the urgency of this was raised in an email

   exchange between Andy Cash, a director of the firm and Jarnail Singh on the 12th

   September 2012, to which I was copied in (POL00020489). Mr Singh explained

   that he had used Gareth Jenkins of Fujitsu in the past for such a purpose but

   raised the issue of his lack of independence. In-house Counsel who had also

   been copied into this email exchange responded that someone entirely

   independent would have been preferred. However, it seems that a decision to

   use Gareth Jenkins was in due course taken in any event due to the

   impracticality of obtaining an independent report in the timescale available in

   court proceedings. I understood that Jarnail Singh was ultimately responsible for

   instructing him and Rachel Panter within the firm had been given responsibility for

   organising the delivery of the reports required as the cases progressed through

   the courts (FUJ00156677).


Prosecution of Khayyam Ishaq

9. I have no recollection of the criminal prosecution of Khayyam Ishaq. From the

   documents provided to me' I believe this file was allocated to my then colleague

   Martin Smith and that he dealt with it.



10. As far as I can now see from these documents my involvement in this case

   extends to being copied into a number of emails, including 26th July 2012, when

   this was identified as a "Horizon" case (UKG100001432), and 6th March 2013

   (FUJOO154128) when I was asked to arrange for hard copies of exhibit reports to

   be printed out and passed onto colleagues attending court on this matter.


Prosecution of Angela Sefton and Anne Nield

11. At some point between the 3 1d February 2012 and 1St March 2012 I received a

   "Green Jacket" file in relation to Angela Sefton and Anne Nield at my office in

   Leicester. The file contained amongst other documents, which I cannot now

   recall, an investigation report by Stephen Bradshaw, Security Manager (the

   investigator), interview summaries, and a letter of instruction dated 2"d February

   2012 from the Fraud Team based in Salford and addressed to Royal Mail Group

   Criminal Law Team, which I assumed was now for my attention (POL00044013).

   The file contained no separate instructions to me, either identifying my specific

   role, or anything else. I believed I was acting as an agent for POL in the

   prosecution. I was not supplied by way of introduction with any policy documents

   in relation to the conduct of prosecutions by POL, disclosure or anything else. I

   was not supplied with any information in relation to the Horizon system, the

   details of any data it generated, issues relating to its reliability, any relevant

   cases, or details regarding any civil actions or otherwise.



12. The letter stated, "It is the Business Unit recommendation that prosecution should

   be pursued provided the evidence is sufficient to do so. Would you therefore

   please advise on the sufficiency of the evidence in this matter. I was

   immediately struck by the implication that considerations in relation to the

   business of POL formed part of the decision-making process when deciding on

   whether an individual should be prosecuted. It was also not clear to me whether I

   was supposed to consider strictly the sufficiency of the evidence or employ the

   wider test used by Crown prosecutors which required a realistic prospect of

   conviction and consideration of the public interest. When I asked for clarification

   regarding the public interest test, I was advised by Jarnail Singh that he

   considered that this test was always met whenever there were losses to the

   public purse (POL monies) and they were over a certain financial threshold akin

   to DWP prosecutions for benefit fraud.



13. Going by the date of my letter of the 1St March 2012, POL00057495, I suspect

   this was the first advice on charge that I prepared for POL, and was also

   therefore the first charging advice I had ever given in relation to a criminal

   prosecution. As far as I can recall, it was one of only two cases where I provided

   charging advice and was involved where the integrity of Horizon became an

                                                                                          WI TN09670100




   issue. Prior to drafting the advice I recall making a telephone call to Stephen

   Bradshaw to introduce myself. There would have been a discussion about the

   case, but I cannot recall the details.


14. 1 stated in my opinion there was sufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect

   of conviction for false accounting based upon the admissions made in interview

   to that effect. I did not believe charges of theft were made out, as I thought it

   impossible to identify who was responsible to the criminal standard or rule out the

   possibility of a third party being to blame. I would like to now add that in interview

   both Angela Sefton and Anne Nield categorically denied stealing any money.

   They acknowledged that the losses could have been down to human error, and

   gave examples of how this had happened. I concluded that this was probably the

   case.


15.1 returned my advice to Salford, I did not know who made the final decision to

   proceed with the prosecution, although the investigation report cited the Senior

   Security Manager as the Designated Prosecution Authority (DPA). I understand

   from POL00105223, a Security Operations Casework Review dated 04/02/13 that

   a file from that time would be forwarded to Jarnail Singh and then the DPA for a

   final review and authority to proceed. I do not know what happened on this

   occasion.


16. Summonses were issued by Liverpool Magistrates Court dated 15th March 2012

   (POL00044030 and POL00044033) and proceed by way of committal to the

   Crown Court with a plea and case management hearing listed for the 9th August

   2012 (POL00056146). I progressed the file by way of casework but did not attend

                                       Page 8 of 23

                                                                                       WI TN09670100




   any of the hearings or conferences throughout the proceedings. I think POL used

   local agents for the advocacy in the Magistrates Court and John Gibson of

   Counsel was instructed in relation to the Crown Court proceedings. I have not

   seen the brief containing his instructions, so cannot recall what it now said.


17. Statements were obtained from the Sub-postmaster, the POL auditors and

   security team who had attended the financial audit on the 6th January 2012; and a

   trustee and book keeper from the charity whose cash flow had been affected

   (POL00059459, POL00044037 and POL00044038) . Exhibits included the 40

   suppressed giro deposit slips, the jointly signed letter by Angela Sefton and Anne

   Nield and the interview tapes and transcripts. These were obtained to support the

   charges of false accounting in the criminal proceedings.


18. Stephen Bradshaw, as well as being the investigator was also the Disclosure

   Officer in this case. He has identified himself as such in all of the relevant

   schedules. This is common practice even amongst the police in routine

   investigations. In addition I have seen that Jarnail Singh also appointed Helen

   Rose as a disclosures officer for "Horizon" cases generally to deal with the

   specific disclosure around previous challenges to the system.


19. Hogan Brown Solicitors requested disclosure papers in their letter of the 10th April

   2012 to assist with plea and mode of trial prior to the first hearing in the

   Magistrates Court (POL00044206). I can see from my letter of the 1St March 2012

   (POL00057495) that I prepared a statement (summary) of facts for this purpose,

   which would have been forwarded to both solicitors, although I have not seen a



                                       Page 9 of 23
                                                                                         WITNO9670100

   copy of this now. I can also see that I reviewed the committal disclosure

   schedules before they were forwarded to the defence.


20.As far as I can recall my subsequent role in respect of disclosure requests and

   applications in this case was to forward these onto Jarnail Singh for his

   instructions and to relay these back to the defence. To request the investigator to

   carry out more tasks related to disclosure requests, and to seek advice from

   Counsel.


21. The defence statement of Angela Sefton dated 18/7112 (POL00044036) included

   a request for details of complaints regarding the operation of the system from

   2005, the steps taken to address these, and information regarding an ongoing

   investigation of these complaints by POL. This was being considered by Jarnail

   Singh in an email of the 23rd July 2012 (POL00058115) and with a copy being

   escalated within POL for a response to be prepared. The defence statement of

   Anne Nield (POL00044042-) contained a similar request for details of complaints

   and investigations into the Horizon computer system. This was followed up with a

   S.8 application for the same disclosure dated 12th September 2012, this time

   including a request for access to the Horizon computer system used by the

   defendant for inspection (POL00058294).



22.Advice was sort from Prosecuting Counsel John Gibson in relation to this

   application. Instructions to him from the firm were first reviewed by a Director

   within the firm and also In-house counsel, who considered that the defence

   should be offered the opportunity to test the system. Specific instructions were

   sort from Jarnail Singh about direct access to the system and a timetable for

                                     Page 10 of 23

   service of the Fujitsu report. He responded by saying that defence experts had in

   the past attended the relevant sub post offices in the past to be able to analyse

   the relevant data etc. but asked to clarify the specifics (POL00058303). The

   response from Mr Gibson is not included in the documentation I have seen, but a

   letter to Anne Nield's solicitors dated 18th September 2012 (POL00058306)

   included reference to the ongoing 2n0 Sight Investigation by Independent

   Auditors, the pending report from Fujitsu, and the following passage: "Defence

   experts have in the past attended the relevant Post Offices to be able to analyse

   the relevant data. Access to the system beyond that would need to be specified

   and approved by POL before being allowed".



23. Mr Gibson provided advice regarding the disclosure of Stephen Bradshaw's

   statement of the 20/9/12 and exhibit SB/51. Instructions regarding disclosure

   were also sent to Prosecuting Counsel on the 5th April 2012, with regard to the

   further evidence obtained by Stephen Bradshaw, and a further disclosure request

   from solicitors on behalf of Anne Nield (POL00044217). My response which

   would have been based on the advice provided is contained in POL00060279.



24.1 also liaised with Mr Bradshaw to address specific disclosure requests made by

   the defence. A further statement from him dated 20th December 2012 addressed

   his enquiries relating to call log information for the branch with the National

   Business Support Centre (POL00044047, POL00044160). These showed that

   calls had been made to the Centre starting 4th August 2005 over the following 3

   weeks regarding a loss of £592.21 which was suspected to relate to the lottery.

   He stated that the matter had been resolved in a call on the 25th August 2005.

25. Further enquiries were conducted in respect of this loss and addressed in a

   follow up statement of his dated 10Th April 2013 (POL00060275). Business

   records indicated that Kevin Ryan, then the Branch Development Manager had

   attended the branch on the 6th September 2005, to explore what had happened

   and was told by the officer in charge, (possibly Anne Neild or Angela Sefton), that

   it was something to do with the upgrade to Horizon online and that no errors

   could be found. When Mr Ryan attended the loss had cleared and there was no

   explanation. They also showed he had attended the branch on the 6Th February

   2006 regarding a shortage of £3959 in January 2006 and all documents,

   transactions and event logs were checked and there was no indication what had

   caused the loss. A history of audits undertaken at the branch was also set out as

   requested.


26. Gareth Jenkins had previously received instructions to prepare a report regarding

   the integrity of Horizon as it related to this case, and had been sent case

   summaries and defence statements for this purpose. I had chased this report on

   the 271h November 2012 as it was still outstanding and the trial was due to take

   place in January at that time. Rachel Panter was due to speak to him the

   following day and would raise it then. I received an email from Mr Jenkins on the

   3rd December 2012 seeking clarification with regard to the content

   (POL00089394). He proposed to clarify that installation of Horizon occurred

   between 1999 and 2002, which did not accord with the start of losses at the

   branch from 2005, and refer to the migration from the original Horizon system to

   the new Horizon online system in 2010. He stated that it has already been

   established that it is not possible to examine the original Horizon system that was

                                     Page 12 of 23

                                                                                      WI TN09670100




   operational until 2010. I took this to mean that this would have been self evident,

   as the counter terminals would have all been replaced in 2010 when the new

   system was installed.



27. There then appears to have been further discussion around events in 2005

   regarding an update to the system to the weekly cash account. This was

   subsequently addressed in his report.



28. Mr Jenkins also makes reference to having not been presented with any audit

   data. By my response in an email at 14:20 that day it would appear that I had

   misunderstood him to be referring to the Horizon print outs obtained for the

   financial audit of the 6th January 2012 and had not understood the wider

   significance of what he was referring to (FUJ00153872).



29.1 received no information by anyone from Fujitsu (or the Post Office) during the

   course of the criminal proceedings against Angela Sefton and Anne Nield with

   regard to known bugs, errors or defects in the Horizon IT system, past or current.



30.1 would like to offer my apology to both Angela Sefton and Anne Nield for my part

   in the injustice they suffered and the awful impact this had upon them.



Prosecution of Grant Allen

31. A green jacket investigation file would have been sent to my office sometime in

   May or June 2012. My recollection is that my role in this case was to act as agent

   on behalf of POL, to include advice on the sufficiency of evidence and carry out

   case work as the file progressed through the prosecution.

                                                                                         WI TN09670100




32. When considering the file I read that a financial audit conducted on the 8th

   February 2012 had shown a cash shortage of £11,705 against his stock unit. Mr

   Allen admitted in interview inflating his cash on hand to achieve a balance,

   putting the approximate amount on the unusable notes line from April 2010 to

   February 2012. However, he had raised an issue with regard to data transfer

   following a relocation of his Post Office. My advice on charge in this matter is set

   out in full at POL00089057. In particular, at paragraph 4.iii) in the first 4 weeks

   there were wiring problems with the terminals, which he believed meant Horizon

   was not sending out (Polling) data. iv) in that period a £3,000 discrepancy arose

   in the accounts which could not otherwise be explained. At para 5 i) the Non

   polled report following the branch relocation showed that an engineer attended

   on the 16th and 17th March 2010 to complete a base unit build and that BT fixed a

   fault. However as of the 17th March 2010 the number of days Not Polled is shown

   as 12.


33. At para 7, "I would advise that an additional statement be provided by, I assume

   Mr Bradshaw, into the enquiries conducted after the interview with regard to the

   non polled report, and lack of calls to the Branch Conformation team and National

   Business Support Centre. With regard to the non polled report, a separate

   statement will be required explaining in lay man's terms, why this not show that

   data could have been lost during the 12 day period identified thus generating the

   £3000 loss as claimed by the defendant."


34. At para 8, "Subject to a satisfactory answer to the above query about the

   possibility of lost data then I would advise that a charge of fraud by false

                                      Page 14 of 23

                                                                                         WI TN09670100




   representation would suit the circumstances described for the period covering Mr

   Allen's admissions in interview with regard to inflated cash declarations.... There

   is insufficient evidence to prove to the criminal standard who if anyone, actually

   stole money from the Post Office".


35. The advice with covering letter, and draft charge were emailed to Post Office

   security on the 4th July 2012, and copied to Stephen Bradshaw, Jarnail Singh,

   and members of the prosecution team within the firm.


36.A decision was taken to authorise prosecution and a summons dated 19th July

   2012 was issued for Mr Allen to attend on the 30th August 2012. I prepared a

   summary of facts for the hearing set out in full at POL00089562, which included

   Mr Allen's account of the £3,000 discrepancy.



37. The case was subsequently listed for committal to the Crown Court on the 25

   October 2012. Stephen Bradshaw is named as the investigator on the disclosure

   schedules, and I believe he would have been acting as the disclosure officer in

   this case. The case was then initially listed for a plea and case management

   hearing on the 10th December 2012.


38. Mr Allen was represented by Maidments Solicitors. I do not recall the contents of

   their letter from the 2 November 2012, but I have responded to them on the

   22nd November in relation to the Second Sight Report that was still pending at

   that time (POL00089376). I suspect that this response would have been drafted

   by POL. I do not know what considerations, if any were made by POL to either

   stay or adjourn the proceedings pending the publication of the report. I would

                                                                                         WI TN09670100




   have thought that such a decision could only have been made at a much higher

   level within the organisation.


39.An entry in the investigation report (POL00089426) indicated that a telephone call

   had been made to the Branch Confirmation Team and they reported that they had

   not been contacted in relation to any £3,000 discrepancy. The call logs were also

   requested from the National Business Support Centre (NBSC) for the period of

   March 2010 to 23rd April 2012. No calls were listed with any discrepancies at the

   branch. A request for Help Desk Calls was made in an email to Gareth Jenkins at

   POL00089378.


40. Mr Jenkins was instructed to prepare reports in cases involving "Horizon" cases

   as already described in paragraphs 7 and 8 above. Case summaries and other

   relevant material was forwarded to him to be able to provide comment on specific

   cases to add to the general reports he had already prepared with regard to the

   different iterations of Horizon. Fujitsu made it clear that POL would have to pay

   for his time in preparing such reports. This was reiterated to the firm in an email

   from Jarnail Singh dated 19th November 2012 at POL00089374, which reads "the

   cost of obtaining data, statements is very expensive.., legal, compliance and

   budgetary obligations puts further restraints on obtaining such data from Fujitsu.

   It is very important due process is strictly followed. I need to be notified if

   anything is required from Fujitsu". I suspect that this email may have been

   forwarded onto me or the general message relayed back.


41. Mr Jenkins would have been initially instructed by Rachel Panter from the firm to

   prepare these reports. I was not involved in that process. I contacted him on the

                                       Page 16 of 23

   4th December 2012 to inform him that I had just spoken to Mr Allen's solicitor as

   she was going to ask the court to relist the case from the 10th December 2012

   until the following January (POL00089378). I took the opportunity to ask him if he

   was able to comment specifically on the non polling data issue that Mr Allen had

   raised in interview and provided him with an extract, in addition to the case

   summary he had already been sent.


42. Mr Jenkins responded by email the following day. He believed he understood the

   issue being raised in relation to the initial loss. He stated any missing data would

   normally be recovered if communication issues were resolved within 35 days. He

   could make a general statement to that effect or carry out an analysis of the

   specific data to see exactly what had happened. He pointed out data retrieval

   was part of the standard service but his analysis would be chargeable to POL. He

   would not be able to carry out analysis until the new year.


43.1 invited him to add his general comments at that stage regarding the safeguards

   in place for comms problems whilst I referred back to POL before incurring any

   expense as per instructions. I attached a copy of the non polling report previously

   obtained as I now understood its relevance. Mr Jenkins responded, "A look at the

   non — poll report shows that the branch was offline for 12 days, assuming it was

   OK after the last entry. The data should have been fully recovered assuming base

   units were swapped correctly and I'll cover that in what I say."


44.At page 3 of Mr Jenkin's report FUJ00124200 he stated, "(Data is held at the

   counter for a period of at least 35 days, so provide a comms outage is less than

   35 days and operational processes regarding replacement hardware are followed

   correctly, then no data should be lost.) I have not had an opportunity to examine

   the detailed logs from this period to see whether there were any issues, and any

   justifications in the claim that this resulted in apparent losses of £3,000 as

   claimed."


45.1 forwarded a copy of the draft report onto Mr Bradshaw for his consideration. In

   my email to Mr Bradshaw (POL00089380) I thought that the report had dealt with

   the non polling issue adequately but pointed out that "it is in fact possible for him

   (Mr Jenkins) to retrieve the actual data from this time to see what actually

   occurred at this branch." That Mr Jenkins had stated the cost of the data was

   free to POL but that the analysis was chargeable. My email continues that I had

   told Mr Jenkins that we did not wish to incur additional costs unless unavoidable,

   although I hadn't in fact said this to him. I cannot now recall why I added this

   comment. I asked Mr Bradshaw for his instructions. I emailed Mr Jenkins later

   on the 12 December 2012, to say "the investigator is happy with the report as it

   stands. Please could you proceed as before" (FUJ00153905). I do not know if Mr

   Jenkins ever conducted any analysis of the data specific to the case. Upon

   conclusion of the proceedings there seems to have been concern by Fujitsu that

   the case "might set a precedent" for comms issues to be a reason for losses.



46.1 received no information by anyone from Fujitsu (or the Post Office) during the

   course of the criminal proceedings against Grant Allen with regard to known

   bugs, errors or defects in the Horizon IT system, past or current.


47.1 would like to offer Mr Allen my apology for my part in the injustice he suffered

   and the awful impact this had upon him.
