Error in Riposte API call: Access is denied. (0x5)
Summary: Error in Riposte API call: Access is denied. (0x5)
Raised: by Anne Chambers on 10/10/2000
Last updated: by Anne Chambers on 16/01/2004
Release: csr_plus
System product: Counter
Keywords: Counter AssetManager”
Status: Authorised
Visibility: Medium
Peak: PCs5072

Version: 1

Symptoms

Events reported each night during RetailBroker initialisation: <br>A required attribute index (Data.BalanceDatald) does not exist. Attempting to
create it.<br>Error in Riposte API call: Access is denied, (0x5)<br>Unable to create attribute index. (Data.BalanceDatald)<br> <br>Affects
only one counter out of 13. Not cleared in this instance by a reboot. No apparent problems with the counter.<br><br>S50: these events still
occur intermittently

Problem

AssetManager is disabled, but creates the index before the disablement becomes effective. At Cl4, in a few instances there appears to be
some problem with permissions/placement and the index cannot be created, giving rise to the errors. <br><br>PINICL PC0055072 and
PC0084623 refer.<br><br>At $30 it has been noted that the events occur when the user switches into Training Mode.

Solution - Helpdesk

Was handed over to Escher Dev, however: <br><br>"This issue is having insufficient effect on the live estate to warrant the investigation of
the fault and production and application of any subsequent fix.<br><br>Should the problem recur and prove to cause a major impact on either
the support community or the end user then the status of this fault will be reviewed."<br><br>These events are benign and should be
ignored, unless they become very frequent and are happening on many counters.
