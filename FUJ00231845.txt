Ken,

After discussion with the SPonsor of this work, Post Office do not see the
need for a separate CT and another Purchase Order.

It is suggested that Fujitsu should just bill the 35 ARQ requests against

the purchase order raised for this CT and roll the remaining 65 forward

into the new Financial Year. The number of requests will be monitored on a
monthly basis and if we approach using up the additional requests in
addition to our existing annual allowance, then raise a new CT at that
point.

Would you kindly forward this on to the respective FS Business Sponsor.

Regards
Darryl Judd

Darryl,

Thank you for the sign-off of CT0724 “Increase the current threshold of 100
Audit Request Queries (ARQ's) for Banking and Card Account Products, to
either 200, 250 or 300 per annum.” and the subsequent confirmation of the
Post Office Ltd choice of Option 1 within the CT.

This has been discussed internally and the Fujitsu business owners have
requested that I provide the following update:

With regard to the sign-off of CT0724, Fujitsu propose to invoice the 2mds

for Service Description updates against the quoted Purchase Order number.
The increased ARQ numbers will be invoiced under the appropriate service
charge once the Service Description and associated CCN have been approved
and signed-off — as such this will be for the forthcoming financial year
2009/10- this will tie-in with the request from Post Office Ltd that this

increase is only for a year and will be monitored and assessed over this
period.

Over and above this a further CT will shortly be raised and submitted to
Post Office Ltd for the c. 35 additional ARQs that have been progressed in
the last year over and above the currently agreed contractual amount, based
on the charge in Schedule D1 (Para 5.5).

Fujitsu would be obliged if you could formally provide this update and
details of the planned approach to the Post Office Ltd business owner for
this area and other relevant parties.
