Subject: RE: [12.00 Friday] Update on the Horizon IT scandal

Thanks Oliver. The CX and CST have agreed to DBT bringing forward legislation to speed up the overturning of
convictions and to the introduction of minimum payments. We understand you are now specifically proposing to
introduce a minimum payment of £75k on the GLO compensation scheme only, with further payments on the HSS to
be considered at a later stage if they are needed. Approval is subject to the following conditions:

1. Access to reserve funding is subject to an assessment of need, realism and affordability at the time at
which the funds are released. This means that any underspends will be used to offset any Reserve claims.
HMT will also need to see evidence of DBT managing down pressures; using any unallocated provision;
and reprioritising/making offsetting savings elsewhere in its budget before reserve access will be granted.
2. DBT should work with POL and Mo to develop a delivery plan and provide greater clarity on the level
and timing of costs. The timeline of this delivery plan must be agreed with HMT.

3. DBT must formally confirm funding requirements over those already requested for 2023-24 that need
to be met at the Supplementary Estimates as soon as possible, where this cannot be met from
underspends or reprioritisation and noting the need for taut and realistic estimates. Costs beyond this will
be considered in the round at Supplementary Estimates in the relevant year, subject to the points made in
condition a above.

4. DBT must ensure DBT’s Principal Accounting Officer has received an AO assessment on these proposals
and is content to agree them. The AO assessment should be shared with HMT.

5. DBT should provide HMT with regular management information and progress reporting (including on
programme delivery and spend to date), timings and details of reporting to be agreed with HMT officials.
6. DBT and MOJ should explore all options to ensure compensation is effectively targeted at postmasters
who have suffered a miscarriage of justice related to the Horizon IT scandal or where POL's 'onerous'
contract with the Postmasters forced the Postmaster to criminal activity.

7. DBT should ensure legislation to overturn convictions includes provision for necessary powers for DBT
to deliver compensation payments directly if they are not to be provided by POL.

8. DBT should work with HMT, Crown Commercial Service and Cabinet Office on maximising cost
BEIS0001189
BEIS0001189

recovery from Fujitsu by the Post Office and DBT if the Statutory Inquiry finds them to be liable. DBT must
ensure that the use of any recovered funds is prioritised for compensating postmasters. Any other use of
such income will be subject to agreement with the Treasury. Any legal action against Fujitsu must
consider impacts on wider public sector contracts delivered by the company.

9. Any funding requirement requested by DBT should also take account of the tax implications of
Government funding the Post Office, e.g., Corporation Tax.

10. All compensation schemes should ensure that they comply with the standards set out by the Counter
Fraud Functional Standard, engaging with the Public Sector Fraud Authority as appropriate.

11. Recognising the position that further payments on the Horizon Shortfall Scheme should not be
considered at this stage, DBT should nonetheless maintain an active review of the position in relation to
the interaction with the £75k minimum payments on the GLO scheme and commit to providing HMT with
regular updates given potential repercussive impacts. DBT should undertake scenario planning to ensure
that any such future payments can be progressed at pace should they be deemed necessary.

Grateful for confirmation from DBT colleagues that they are content with these conditions.

Many thanks

Hi Ben, all,

Thank you for the advice and recommended approach from the Lord Chancellor and Minister Hollinrake. The PM is
content to proceed with an announcement on blanket quashing of convictions, but, per the Lord Chancellor’s advice,
carving out the [7] cases whose convictions were upheld in the Court of Appeal. The PM would like further advice on
this group, and also the approach for others who went through the CoA. Ed L—you’re in touch with Sarah.

We will be in touch overnight on next steps on collective agreement.

And finally, a reminder on information security. Can everyone please keep on tight loop according to departmental
info security arrangements.

Thanks very much Rob. From MouJ’s perspective we agree that Minister Hollinrake will be
delivering the oral statement so it is right that you've written it from that perspective.

Sarah we spoke, but just for the benefit of the chain and to reiterate the points that were made on
ownership yesterday, MoJ’s strong position is that while we are more than happy to support on this
issue as much as we can, the policy responsibility, underpinning legislative ownership and any
actions responsible for securing collective agreement on it (including PO-PO agreement) will be
led by and owned by DBT. We will follow up with a PPS/PPS letter setting out further detail on this
position tomorrow, but given wider discussions about Departmental ownership are still ongoing I
thought it would be helpful to clarify ahead of any decisions first thing in the morning.

Evening all!

I attach a first draft of a speaking note for tomorrow’s oral statement. So far it only covers the overturning of
convictions, as that’s the trickiest bit involving most colleagues. I shall now turn my mind to what we can say about
the GLO points.

The note reflects Ministers’ concern that we should, so far as possible, “bind in” all parties in the House to accepting
the risks of the solution

I’ve written this on the assumption that Minister Hollinrake will speak. I believe Private Offices are discussing that. If
the decision is that it should instead be the LC, I’m sure the text can easily be adapted.

Sharepoint version attached for DBT colleagues: doc version for others.
I haven’t had the chance to look at any emails since the start of this evening’s meeting with the LC. If I’ve missed
relevant points which have emerged since, I apologise: please let me know.

Hi Ben, Jamie,

Thanks for the engagement.

Ben — to recap, we’re expecting from MoJ two things for 1815 — the next window for the PM to review:
* Readout of the meeting between LC and Minister Hollinrake.
* The advice which went to the LC.

Jamie — thanks to you and team for the detail on cohorts and schemes.

Could we please urgently have some further stats (which the PM asked the minister for directly):
* [Top priority] Average payment for GLO cohort, the number of awards we can expect to settle at £50k and
BEIS0001189
BEIS0001189

75k, why the department is in favour of 75k instead of 50k, and the percentage of HSS/GLO awards that are very
low (i.e. less than 5k).

© for each cohort, what is the total number of postmasters, # and % who have received interim and final
payments, and the average award. Can we have this in table form (per below)?

* Why are only 484 of the 555 GLO cohort eligible for compensation? Why have only 474 of 484 received their
interim payment?

* What does the 64% figure refer to (The latest report shows that as of 1 December over 64% of eligible
postmasters have received compensation)?

* What is the composition of the independent assessment panels for GLO and HSS schemes?

© What was the first date wrongdoing ‘came to light’? When did the PO first admit guilt?

* What is the average payment to people across all three compensation schemes (i.e. the £148m paid to 2,700
(what's the exact number?)?

Hi Oliver, Sarah

I just wanted to make you aware of the attached correspondence we've received this afternoon (via
DBT) from Peters and Peters. As you can see, among other issues their key assessment is that it
is likely that the vast majority of people who have not yet appealed their conviction were in fact
guilty and safely convicted. Of course we will need to test the validity of this, including what
evidence they are using to come to that conclusion, but given the obvious material risks that this
information has on a policy of mass exoneration the Lord Chancellor is particularly keen that i) this
is shared with the political team in Number 10 so that they are aware of the risk and ii) we engage
properly with Peters and Peters before moving forward with any further action this afternoon to test
their position and are fully across any related risks before making a decision on the best policy.

I understand that a call is being set up with DBT/Mo4J officials and Peters and Peters shortly, and
while the Lord Chancellor understands the need to move quickly with this he would like a further
update following that call to understand the validity of the position from Peters and Peters. I would
be grateful if DBT/MoJ officials could revert back with a further update following that discussion.

Thanks,
Ben

The Advisory Board’s focus is a pro bono group meeting every six weeks to advise DBT Ministers on delivering fair
compensation outcomes. It does not have the capacity to develop policy, nor the expertise in financial management
which would be required for it to generate a recommendation in respect of the admin of the scheme. However we
will, as a matter of course, consult them on how the scheme should be run.

On the stakeholder handling plan, we assume that policy changes will be heavily trailed by the PM tomorrow with the
big picture announced to the House by Minister Hollinrake tomorrow or Thursday.
© He has already been informally engaging Lord Arbuthnot and Kevan Jones MP.
* We will recommend that he attends a pre-planned meeting of Horizon Compensation Advisory Board Weds
PM.
* We will also recommend that he calls Alan Bates before the formal announcement.
© The other key campaigners have been journalists: probably too soon to do interviews with the specialists
(Witherow, Flinders, Wallis) who can go with our normal media briefing.
* He may also wish to call his predecessor Paul Scully, whose stance has been supportive.
* Post Office policy is reserved, so there is no need for him to call the DAs. Justice policy is devolved: MoJ
colleagues will want to advise on contacts with Scottish and NI administrations.

I attach flow charts on the detail on the “customer experience” of the different cohorts of postmasters. Very grateful
to_@Emily SNOWes(DBT) and colleagues for their work on this.

Hi all,
Please see our Mol policy line as follows:

We will introduce legislation to overturn convictions that were reliant on erroneous evidence and the
egregious behaviour of the Post Office in the period in question. We are urgently working on the detail
including how to handle the small number of convictions where there was genuine wrongdoing. Further
details will be announced in due course.

Please also see below the readout following the LC’s meeting with the LCJ.

Attendees: LC; LIC; Terry McGuinness; Andrew Key; Ed Lidington; Naomi Mallick; Sally Rushton; Hannah
Galley; Joanna McCloskey; Samuel Hardy

Actions:
+ With respect to the four upheld conviction cases, @Lidington, Ed! GRO _ to investigate options
(particularly regarding the second option) further.

Option 1:
* The LC discussed the option of removing a private prosecution (in this case the Post Office) and
replacing with this with the CPS. CPS would then have to consider each case on an individual basis
which would likely take a very long time and the AG says the CPS don’t have capacity. The LC added
that anything prosecuted by the Post Office could be considered prima facie and abuse.
¢ The LCJ noted this would be fraught with difficulties and didn’t sound very principled. Both her and
the LC agreed that this option may invite litigation.

Option 2:
« The LC discussed a second (recommended) option which would allow parliament to introduce a short
bill to quash all convictions within a certain time frame. For transparency, individuals would have to
sign a disclaimer to seek compensation. The LCJ felt this option would be cleaner and quicker but
noted the risk of setting a precedent and that a small number of people would escape proper
prosecution. Most crucially, this option presents serious questions on the four previously upheld
convictions. It would be extremely difficult constitutionally to legislate to overturn cases where the
court upheld the conviction.

Judicial Independence:
« The LCJ said that both options heavily impinge on the judiciary. Should parliament legislate in
quashing convictions (option 2), the currency of the court may be weakened.
« The LCJ was keen to affirm that there has not been a delay in the judicial process throughout. E.g.
Horizon cases are not new and that civil litigation has been ongoing since 2015/6, with some cases still
in review.
« In this vein, the LC) suggested a third option, in which the Court of Appeal continue to review cases
on an individual basis, and redoubling efforts to encourage people who haven’t engaged in the system
previously to come forward. On this third option, the LC noted considerable concerns with regards to
the wellbeing of those affected, and that they may already be too disillusioned to reach out.
BEIS0001189
BEIS0001189

Decision:
* Crucially, the LCJ did not outright reject or oppose any options but noted we have a considerable
issue with respect to the four upheld cases. She reinforced her opinion of Option 2 (clearing
convictions) as the ‘cleanest’ (the four difficult upheld cases aside) and the first option as the most

problematic.

Hi all

In the light of this afternoon’s meeting, below is a write-up of the lines which the Minister laid out for this
afternoon’s statement. We will need to merge it with some additional contextual material which colleagues
here had already prepared. I would welcome comments.

Apologies to those who have already received this on another chain.

Draft statement by Minister Hollinrake 8 Jan 2024
POST OFFICE HORIZON

1. I’m very glad that last week’s ITV drama about the Post Office has brought an understanding of the
Horizon scandal to a much broader audience. Those of us who have been campaigning on the issue for
some years were already well aware of what happened. Watching the programmes has reinforced our
zeal for seeing justice done as quickly as possible.

2. We are already a long way down that road. Sir Wyn Williams’s inquiry is doing great work in
exposing what went wrong. And full compensation has already been paid to 64% of those affected.

3. I have previously said to the House that my main concern now is the slow pace at which criminal
convictions related to Horizon are being overturned by the Courts. Before Christmas the Advisory
Board published a letter which underlined that.

4. This is not just a matter of getting justice for those wrongly convicted. Overturning their convictions
will also unlock compensation. Each person whose conviction is overturned is entitled to an interim
compensation payment of £163,000. They can then choose whether to have their compensation
individually assessed or to accept an up-front offer of £600,000. That offer is already speeding along
compensation for a number of people.

5. In the light of the Advisory Board’s letter about overturning convictions I have spoken to RH gent for
Durham North and to Lord Arbuthnot. I’m very grateful for the work which they and their colleagues
are doing. I have also had a very positive meeting this afternoon with my RHF the Lord Chancellor this
afternoon. All of us on these benches — and across the House — are united in our desire to see justice
done.

6. We have devised some options for resolving the outstanding criminal convictions much more
quickly. My RHF the Lord Chancellor will, quite rightly, need to speak to senior figures in the judiciary
BEIS0001189
BEIS0001189

about those options before we put them forward.

7. But I am confident that we shall be able to implement measures which address the concerns
expressed by the Advisory Board. I hope to be able to bring these to the House later this week.

8. Ona slightly separate note, there is clearly great concern about the role of the Post Office in
prosecuting these cases. The Post Office quite rightly decided to stop undertaking its own prosecutions
some years ago.

9. Any company can bring private prosecutions in this way: this is not a special power of the Post
Office. If we are to make sure that a scandal like this can never happen again, we need to look at the
way in which private prosecutions in general are undertaken, and not just at the Post Office. I know
that my RHF the Lord Chancellor wants to do that. He intends to report to the House about this issue
in due course.

10. Getting justice for these people — and ensuring that such injustice can never happen again — is my
highest priority as a Minister. I assure the House that we will do all we can to secure it.

Many thanks to your ministers and officials for coming to the meeting earlier.
Below I have set out the current state of play:

Policy proposal: The proposal decided upon is that we announce that all convictions related to
the Post Office Horizon scandal (exact scope TBC) are deemed unsafe and therefore will be
quashed through primary legislation.

As per the current rules around compensation, those whose convictions will be quashed will be
eligible for compensation and will be required to confirm their innocence in writing in advance of
receiving compensation.

Next steps:

@Minister HOLLINRAKE (DBT) DBT parliamentary team to work with the Leaders Office and
Parliamentary Counsel to see if there is way for any legislation to be crafted such that it does not
become a hybrid bill, and to provide an update on how soon any legislation could be brought
forward and passed;

@Minister HOLLINRAKE (DBT) to share the draft statement Minister Hollinrake will be making this
afternoon;

@PS Lord Chancellor (us) to update post 16:30 on the call with the Lady Chief Justice;
@Minister HOLLINRAKE (DBT) to provide details of the total of number of people who would be
covered by the above policy proposal, the estimated cost, and timescale over which that would
materialise (this was the request from the CST @Action.CST)

Very happy to discuss — hopefully this is helpful. I also have the cast list of who was at the meeting
earlier — if anyone would like this please let me know.

Thanks Oliver.
Please could I add a further question for DBT onto the below.

Given postmasters’ distrust of POL, on the face of it there is a case for asking the department to take on
responsibility for the administration of the HSS and overturned convictions compensation scheme. Has the
department considered the feasibility of this? And if so, what would the impact be on the administration of
these schemes?

Jamie,

Many thanks for this note. We’ve discussed with a few colleagues this morning. Conscious a lot of work is
already underway on options, and Minister Hollinrake, the Lord Chancellor, AG and CST are meeting over
lunchtime. But to confirm, by 17.00 this afternoon please could we ask for you to work with MoJ and HMT
to develop the following:

1. Advice from MoJ and DBT on whether we should overturn all Horizon-related convictions. This note
should include advice on the legislative vehicle, whether we would need to design a filtering process to
ensure rightly convicted postmasters are not exonerated, and whether a blanket process would ensure
eligible for the existing OC compensation scheme [Note — this builds on the ask from Sarah Barrett
yesterday evening].

2. Advice from HMT on the fiscal impact of overturning (all vehicles) and we would be comfortable
taking on these costs. It would be great to highlight any potential interdependency with Infected
Blood.

3. Advice from HMT and DBT on whether we should introduce a minimum £75k payment for the GLO
cohort, and whether this policy would sufficiently answer the question about the pace of
compensation the CX raised over the weekend.

We’ve now had through 3 UQs on Horizon. Our view is Minister Hollinrake should make a statement to the
House this afternoon (understand that’s your emerging preference too). We would be grateful if you could
share a draft statement by 14.00. It should be developed on the basis of the lines we were deploying over
the weekend, but we can drop in more forward-leaning language (and e.g. updates on the Forfeiture
Committee process) over the course of the afternoon if we have nailed down policy.

Jamie —I tried calling quickly. If you have a sec, would you mind calling back oni.

Kind regards,
Oliver

Subject: Re: [12.00 Friday] Update on the Horizon IT scandal

Hi Will, Oliver

Please find attached our return. Apologies for the slight delay in getting this back to you, we've
been working at pace to develop a fuller note. The reason for a fuller note is that Minister
Hollinrake has been in discussion with the PM, Chancellor and Chief Whip directly since the airing
of the ITV Drama.

Minister Hollinrake promised to get them a note on how we could speed up compensation
payments for those impacted by the scandal. Minister Hollinrake is keen the PM sees this note and
takes a view on the points rasied in bullets 1-4 (forgive my limited understanding on how the PM's
box works), which we will then share more widely with the Chancellor and the Chief Whip.

The first two pages are the additional drafting we've done beyond your original commission. The
last 3 pages cover the questions raised in your original commission.

Please do let us know if you have any further questions.
very best,
Jamie

Rob, Carl,

BEIS0001189

Happy new year. I hope you enjoyed the Christmas break.

Given the recent coverage, I wanted to share an update with some of the political team in no10 regarding
the horizon IT scandal. Specifically, I want to cover off:

1. A bit of history regarding the scandal itself and the different cohorts of those affected.

2. What the government has done to address the scandal to date.

3. Actions over the course of the next 12 months (e.g. Post Office compensation bill; Wyn Inquiry
response etc)

Would it be possible to pull something together by 12.00 tomorrow please? We’ re just looking for a bit of
background (no more than 3 pages), so this should just be a repackaging exercise.

Thanks so much in advance — and please do drop me a line if you have any questions.
