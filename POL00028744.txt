hen they completed the balance on 6th Feb and cleared the loss from Local Suspense, the amount cleared was £9839.
floss they had put into local suspense, which was £39.57

5 instead of theI

Whis appears to be a consequence of something that happened during the previous TP rollover on 2nd Jan: a ‘gain to local suspense’
f £9799.88 was included in the DEF opening figures.

Ht don't think any of the local suspense products should ever appear in opening figures, however I have found 14 such lines (all
rod 6295 Gain to LS, all different branches). Unfortunately all created Nov-Dec last year, so there is almost no remaining counterI
evidence.

ontinuing to invetigate cause and implications.

suspense report for TP9 (2nd Jan 2013) received, which shows no anomaly. I thought it might show 9799.88- c/f, since that amount isI

b/f on the TP10 report, but it doesn't.

[the branch also sent the suspense report for TP10 2012, with the comment that they had the same problem last year - and although it]
lis a very faint copy, it appears to show 9799.88- b/f.

I have now found the cause of the problem: some data from autumn 2010 has been retained in table BRDB_RX_BTS DATA, for 14 separate
ranches. These branches will all have been affected by this problem late 2011 and late 2012, though in some cases the amounts
involved are small.

still to be investigated:

LExactly how did these records cause the observed effect?
Lwhy were the records not removed by the normal archiving process?

HWhat impact has the problem had on the branch accounts?

What impact has the problem had on POLSAP?

[How do we remove the records to prevent future problems?

Were there any affected branches which have since closed?

[There are 19 other branches which have old data in the affected table, but not relating to Local Suspense ? could this cause any
roblems with the branch accounts? (some may be temporarily closed)

Te:28-Feb-2013 14:06:00 User:Anne Chambers
[Start of Response]
Further investigations:

* Exactly how did these records cause the observed effect?

[the old data is picked up, along with the correct data, during the Branch Trading Statement production (at the end of the period
BEFORE the problem is visible at the branch). The old opening figure (which may be for one or more of the Local Suspense products
295-6298, associated with an unknown stock unit) gets converted during branch rollover, to prod 6295 Gain to Local Suspense
(though the sign may be positive or negative), and written as an opening figure for the subsequent period, stock unit DEF.

Jat the end of the second period, this is included when the amount to be cleared from Local Suspense is calculated (when the last
stock unit is rolled over), so the branch is forced to clear it.

* How to identify the problem from branch reports
ranch Trading Statement: the sum of the two D:
Lines

Suspense Account report: the B/Fwd figure on the report does not match the C/Fwd figure on the report for the previous TP.

epancy Transferred lines does not match the total of the two Discrepancy ResolvedI

h* Why were the records not removed by the normal archiving process? The records, created Autumn 2010, belonged to stock units thatI
ave since been deleted. Normally they would have been removed before the ‘deleted stock unit' entry itself was removed from the
flist of stock units, but there were some teething problems with archiving and they were ‘orphaned’ and are now ignored by the
lrchiving process.

h* How do we remove the records to prevent future problems? Once well away from the problem TP, eg once into TP 1, get the branches}
to recreate a stock unit with the same name as the problem one, then delete it again. Or we just delete them from the database
nder MSC.

H+ Were there any affected branches which have since closed? I have checked branches closed within the last 90 days, all ok. For
branches closed longer ago which might be under investigation, the suspense account reports and BTS could be checked (see above) .

** There are 19 other branches which have old data in the affected table, but not relating to Local Suspense ? could this cause an:
problems with the branch accounts?
It have checked very carefully and conclude that these extra lines have no ongoing impact on the branch accounts.

* There is old data in some other tables that use the same archiving strategy - this doesn't affect the branch balancing in the
same way, but what would happen if a stock unit with the same name was recreated?

F/1048.1/3

POL00028744
POL00028744

Fe Any corrective actions?
tocal suspense should always be zero when the branch is rolled over - should this be checked and reported?
It think the archiving strategy is now ok, but this may need to be reviewed.

Still to do:
* What impact has the problem had on the branch accounts?
* What impact has the problem had on POLSAP?

here was a conference call with POL (Laura Darby, Mark Wardle and others) on 28th Feb about this call, and the spreadsheet showing]
the impact of the problem on the 14 branches was sent to them by Steve Bansal. We are waiting to hear from Mark whether this is
sufficient information for them to resolve the consequences on the branches and POLSAP.

le will then need to get the old data causing the problem removed from the database (before TP 9 - Oct-Nov 2013) and consider
ihether extra checks should be put in place to trap similar anomalies in the future.

here are records in table BRDB_RX_BTS_DATA, created Autumn 2010, belonging to stock units that have since been deleted. Normally
they would have been removed before the ‘deleted stock unit! entry itself was removed from the list of stock units, but there were
some teething problems with archiving and they were ‘orphaned’ and are now ignored by the archiving process.

[thee are also some old records in BRDR SU OPENING BALANCE for the game reason.
