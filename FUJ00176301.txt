Subject: Lost Audit data changes
Attachment: changes for lost audit data1_.doc

Given that Mike Hannon has now agreed to the terms of my letter dated 13 Sept - could a CCN be issued to reflect the

attached changes and that £150,000 (rather than £100,000) be used against future CCNs excluding Debit Card.
Thanks
Colin
