additional cost associated with implementing this
change over and above what would and could be
covered under OBC, there were certain caveats
that need to be passed back to POL.

Initially a CCN had been allocated to respond to
the CR, but it was now believed that a no-charge
CT would be more appropriate to respond. G
Wilkerson stated he believed the number of
opening was in the Contract in which case a
CCN must be used and agreed to provide details.

CCB had no further comment on the CP and
approved the change with the actions:

Actions:

1. G Wilkerson to confirm whether a CCN
was required.

2. If Action I was not the case ChM to
advise POL that a CT would be used for
response and not a CCN.

3. N Young/Commercial to draft CT or
CCN.

4. __ChM to submit CT or CCN.

APPROVED

CP presented by D Hinde and W Warham who
confirmed that this was a must have from CS
perspective and as such W Warham had agreed to
cover the 100.Smds impacted (78.5 incremental).

S Denham identified that this was currently being
performed by a series of people using manual
processes, with the inherent risk to data integrity
and was of the order of 9mds a month. G
Wilkerson queried the savings on this and after
discussion S Denham identified that this change
was to introduce automation to bring us back to a
baseline position.

W Warham requested S Denham take an action
to include this in the CS Forecast for April and S
Denham agreed to do this.

Over and above that W Warham stressed that this

N/A

N/A

was needed for accreditation and for acceptance
into service as reducing litigation risk and
improving data integrity and confidence in the
records.

R Wright asked when this was expected to be
delivered and D Hinde stated that this was
towards the end of June (i.e. post Pilot).

G Wilkerson identified that the CP contained the
words “is fit for purpose” and stated that this
statement should not be used, even on internal
documents and P Sewell accepted an action to
amend this.

CCB had no further comment and approved the
cP.

Actions:

1. S Denham to include the mds are
included in the CS Forecast for April.

2. P Sewell to amend words in the CP from
““if fit for purpose” to “meets the
contractual requirements”.

P.M.N. CP wording updated by P Sewell and
ChM to reflect the request made at CCB, Action

IMPACTED

CP presented by D Hinde, who advised that this
was addressing a further Solution Gap for Oracle
Upgrade and was a reduced version of CP0334
which had been withdrawn.

ChM identified that the CP was not fully
impacted and was being presented for Provisional
Approval of the Development work to allow this
to start. Dev was 6mds incremental. D Hinde
advised that approval was also required for
Integration — but those figures had not yet been
received.

D Cooper expressed the concern from ITU, that
whilst appreciating that this work needed to be
done, the likelihood was that this CP presents a

high-risk to the programme and can not be
delivered without moving key L1 dates.

D Hinde provided a brief background to the
requirements for the change commenting on the
involvement from Dev and Integration.

CCB did not believe that there was sufficient
information to provide Provisional Approval at
this time and set the CP back to impacting. D

Hinde accepted an action to convene a meeting of

key parties (V Cochrane, R Wright, D Cooper,
CS) to consider what has to be done and what
the implications are on the plan, live service, etc,
presenting back to the next CCB along with the
impacted CP.

CCB queries why it was being presented at this
forum and should it not be going through BNB
and BAR and G Wilkerson confirmed it had, and
this was purely for visibility as it had been
decided to hive off this initial piece of work from
the draft CCN into CT0740. G Wilkerson added
that the figures in the CT were based on actuals
to date and for the period up to May.

CCB asked if there was a chance of exceeding the
gross price in the CT and G Wilkerson advised

no as the work would be scoped accordingly. G
Wilkerson added that follow-on changes would

be coming through that required input from HNG-I
X and Service.

CCB acknowledged the CT and agreed a status of

continuation to the work that has been approved
undercuts 0690 and 0703.

D Gilbert provided background to the additional
requirements, including POLs decision to change
Backup structure and the request for additional
licences and confirmed that many of these had
been agreed with POL by way of e-mails. And
identified that much of this work has already
happened. H Chung asked if he could have copies
of these to evidence that the account was not
working at risk and D Gilbert agreed to supply
these.

CT had been through Commercial and the
wording agreed.

ChM, S Denham and W Warham queried the
impact on on-going charges and ChM identified
that CCN1252 was already submitted to POL for
the on-going charges for POLMI and CCB.
queried whether this would need updating in
light of these additional requirements.

W Warham requested that she and G Wilkerson
re-assess these changes and requested that the
CCN be actioned to deferred with POL at this
time whilst the issues are resolved

Due to the issues raised CCB were not happy to
submit at this time until the impact on on-going
costs was ascertained and requested that the
change be deferred and the CT not submitted
with the following actions:

Actions:
1. D Gilbert to provide H Chung with e-
mail evidence of POL approval ahead of
CT.

Kirkham or W Warham had queried the non-charging of this work and D Cooper advised they had not.

indicative estimates.
