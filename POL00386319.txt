Subject: Re: Select Committee: initial briefing material and other actions

Thank you Jane.
On the Andy Furey point, I saw him today. He is considering what the CWU position will be, he said. He suggested that
he was not keen to give evidence but was under pressure internally to do so. He said there were two issues: first, re

Horizon. Secondly, our handling of the issue.

We agreed to discuss further and I will brief Tom (copied).
