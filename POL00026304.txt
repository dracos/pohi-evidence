Thanks Rod

This is helpful but I think timing wise it would be helpful for this to be urgently update on Monday morning re the audit
issue so we cant finalise it properly. So, lets get the audit issue sorted so we can give a final view to the Board Monday
morning.

Thanks
Ben

Ben.

I have updated the KEL Action table in light of the response received from Freeths today (see SharePoint link below, also
attached in Word).

https://poluk.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/POA001/legal/EbCRCoxZ17NDtynkVwcFXEUBgP3Qi9HB6hD 1doQzEw0Ceg

I have again also sought to flag the main developments in the form of a draft covering email for you to send to the Board
as you see fit.

Please let me know if you require anything further.
Rod

DRAFT EMAIL BEGINS

All

Attached is our KEL’s action tracker which outlines the progress that has been made. In summary:

1. The Claimants have now indicated to the Court that they do not intend to make further submissions on the KEL
issue because they do not want to delay delivery of the Horizon judgment.

2. The audit of the completeness of Fujitsu’s KEL disclosure has commenced and is proceeding at pace. A
preliminary view will be provided on Monday 4 November on whether Post Office may need to take further
action to comply with its legal duties around document disclosure in the litigation.

3. Advice on what (if anything) should be communicated to the Court and/or Claimants about the audit, and the
impact this could have on the litigation, will be provided at that time.

Please do let me know if you have any queries.
