1 Introduction

The TPS report set has been designed to enable the Electronic Point of Sale
Service (EPOSS) system on the Outlet Processing System (OPS), to be
reconciled with the transaction data which is returned to POCL Transaction
Information Processing (TIP), and also to reconcile the daily transaction data
with the Cash Account (CA) data at the end of the Cash Account Period
(CAP). The reports also identify any exceptions, which occur with Counter
transactions, or during the Harvesting process. In addition to exceptions
highlighted within the EPOSS report set, exceptions may also be discovered
by POCL for non reported errors or client enquiries.

2 Scope

This document sets out the reconciliation and incident management
procedures to be adopted by the Management Support Unit (CS / MSU), for
dealing with the Transaction Processing System (TPS) reconciliation report
exceptions and POCL raised incidents. This includes reconciling the data
contained in the reports and raising Horizon System Help Desk (HSH)
incidents and Business Incident Management System (BIMS) reports where
necessary.

NB: ‘BIMS’ replaces the current Reconciliation Exception Database (RED)
from January 2000 subject to agreement between ICL Pathway and POCL re.
the content and format of the incident management reports. If further work is
required and BIMS cannot be delivered by January 2000, it must be assumed,
within this document that where references are made to BIMS reports, the
existing RED reports will continue.

3. TPS Reconciliation Reports

ICL Pathway will generate five daily TPS exception reports:
1. Host Detected Transaction Control Errors

2. TPS Harvester Exceptions

3. Host Detected Cash Account Control Errors

4. Counter Deleted Reconciliation Errors

5. Counter Transaction Exceptions

NB: It is not intended that this document discuss the format or content of the
individual reconciliation reports

All five reports will be routed to ICL Pathway Customer Service Management
Support Unit (MSU), on a daily basis by 09.00hrs, where they will be checked
for completeness and accuracy of content. In the event that the reports do not
arrive, or after checking appear to be incorrect, MSU will raise an ‘A’ priority
system incident via the HSH.

It is not intended that MSU will deliver any of the reports to POCL as a matter
of course. An extract from a reconciliation report may however be delivered
as ‘evidence’ as an attachment to the BIMS report if it is considered that this
would aid in the reconciliation process.

4 Reconciliation and Incident Handling

4.1 Incident Classification

4.1.1 Business Incidents
Resolve the ‘Symptom’ of an underlying cause
All exceptions highlighted within the EPOSS report set, and all reconciliation
or settlement issues highlighted by POCL TIP or TP are classified as
‘Business Incidents’. The incident classification determines the resolution
detail required to bring the incident to a satisfactory conclusion. In the case of
Business Incidents, MSU will ensure sufficient data is supplied to POCL to:
e enable a complete and accurate reconciliation to occur within the POCL

central systems
Or;
e enable a complete and accurate settlement to take place between POCL
and their client(s).

4.1.2 System Incidents
Resolve the underlying ‘Cause’
System incidents can be raised initially to cover file rejections or non delivery,
where there is no associated Business Incident. However, following the
creation of a Business Incident, it may be deemed necessary to raise an
associated ‘System Incident’. This can be routed to the appropriate area
within ICL Pathway, i.e. Development or Reference Date, if it is felt that there
is a fault within the Horizon System software or reference data that requires
attention.
Where there are associated ‘System’ and ‘Business’ incidents, their
relationship can be either:
¢ one to one
Or;
¢ one to many

4.2 Incident Originators
It is envisaged that ‘Business’ incidents will only be generated by the
following areas within ICL Pathway and POCL:

POL00043734

POL00043734

ersion:0.
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date:03/12/99

¢ CS/ MSU for exceptions reported via the EPOSS report set and the Non
Polled outlets report

e POCL TIP/ TP for any other reconciliation or settlement issue that has not
been reported by ICL Pathway.

It is not expected at this point that Outlet calls to the HSH will generate
‘Business’ incidents. However calls from Outlets will be monitored and if it is
felt there is a need to route any incident to CS / MSU for action the procedure
can be easily adapted to cater for this occurrence

4.3. Generation of Business Incidents.

In line with the generic incident management policy agreed between ICL
Pathway and POCL, cross-domain incidents will only be recognised if routed
via the HSH. This is the only way into BIMS and therefore the only way to
ensure that corrective information can be supplied and any underlying system
fault can be rectified.

It is important that enough information is supplied to the HSH when raising an
incident to ensure that the incident is routed to the correct area within ICL
Pathway and therefore guarantee a speedy resolution. The following
information must ALWAYS be quoted when raising an incident via the HSH:

A valid ‘PATH’ code must be quoted, e.g. ‘PATH040’ etc.
Prefix all narrative with ‘THIS IS A BUSINESS INCIDENT FOR MSU’

Where ever possible, always quote a valid incident type (from the Business
Incident Matrix, see below) together with any other relevant detail, e.g.
product id, CA lines etc.

4.4 Business Incident Matrix

The following table identifies Business incident classes provisionally agreed
between ICL Pathway and POCL at the joint workshop held on 02/11/99 for
EPOSS / TPS related exceptions. It is an initial attempt to identify as many of
the incident classes as possible but is not meant to be exhaustive as new
incident classes can be added at any time according to requirements.

Incident Reporting

BIMS reports

BIMS has been designed to report the progress to resolution of a ‘Business’
incident to allow POCL to complete an accurate reconciliation or settlement
with their clients. For ease of identification and associating with the
corresponding HSH call, BIMS report references will mimic the HSH
reference however they will be prefixed with a letter ‘B’, e.g. HSH ref:
E9912120011 = BIMS ref: BE9912120011.

A BIMS report will be issued for each individual exception raised via the HSH
to generate a ‘Business’ incident. However it has been agreed between ICL
Pathway and POCL that in certain circumstances, the reconciliation and
settlement detail will not be supplied via the BIMS route, as POCL would wish
to see corrected transaction detail supplied electronically across the ICL
Pathway / TIP interface — the ‘50+’ ruling. In this case, a BIMS report would
merely advise the file details in which the corrected transactions have been
supplied. The rules and assumptions used for the generation of electronic
data are described in section 4.6.2 ‘Correction File Required’

BIMS reports are only designed to advise any detail required to assist in this
reconciliation or settlement process within POCL. They communicate only the
resolution of the ‘Symptom’ of any underlying cause.

BIMS reports will not advise any detail as to the underlying ‘Cause’ of the
problem if this is a result of a software error etc. This information is supplied

via the ‘System Incident Log’, (SIL). Where an associated ‘System’ incident
is raised to eradicate the cause of a particular problem, leading to one or a
series of ‘Business’ incidents, cross references will be supplied on the
‘Business’ incident BIMS report to allow tracking of the ‘System’ incident.

System Incident Log

The SIL is intended to track the progress to resolution of a ‘System’ incident
raised to eradicate an underlying system fault. In practice, one system fault
could lead to a number of ‘Symptoms’ generating ‘Business’ incidents. The
SIL has been developed to remove the need to annotate each BIMS report
associated with a particular system fault, with the detail required to ensure
POCL are fully advised as to the nature of this fault and how it is to be
rectified.

An example of a completed SIL is shown in Appendix 1
Reporting Timescales

An initial BIMS report will be issued by CS / MSU on the same working day as
the incident is raised via the HSH. This initial report may or may not have all
the detail required to enable POCL to reconcile or settle with their client(s),
however it will be followed up by subsequent versions as more information is
acquired by CS / MSU.

The final BIMS report advising full reconciliation and settlement information
must be completed within five working days from the date the ‘Business’
incident was raised via the HSH.

Where a correction file is required, this must also be delivered to TIP within
five working days from the date the ‘Business’ incident was raised via the
HSH.

There is no strict timescale for the resolution of an associated ‘System’
incident as the time taken to develop a fix or correct erroneous reference data
cannot be determined. Obviously however, ICL Pathway will give every
incident the priority it deserves in conjunction with POCL’s requirement. The
SIL, advising the current status of this ‘System’ incident will be delivered to
POCL TIP / TP at the end of each week. POCL may telephone CS / MSU at
any time to receive an update as to the status of any incident documented on
the SIL.

4.6 Incident Management Procedures
The following flowcharts have been prepared to describe the processes
required to bring each ‘Business’ and ‘System’ incident to a successful
conclusion within ICL Pathway and POCL.

Rules and Assumptions

1. Where there are >=50 exceptions of the same type highlighted on one
exception report, MSU will request a decision from POCL as to whether
they require the corrected transactions to be forwarded electronically to
TIP. If this is the prefered option, one ‘Business’ incident will be raised to
cover all applicable exceptions which will generate one BIMS report.

Where there is an accumulation of 50 or more exceptions of the same

type within a single CAP, designated Thursday to the following

Wednesday, MSU will request a decision from POCL as to whether they
required the corrected transactions to be forwarded electronically to TIP. If
this is the preferred option, one new ‘Business’ incident will be raised to
cover all applicable exceptions, which will generate a new BIMS report.
Any existing BIMS reports raised throughout the period for the individual
exceptions, which have now accumulated to 50+ will be cleared and then
closed at the following monthly reconciliation review.

The processes highlighted within this document are not intended to replace
the current agreed Problem Management procedures, which will run side by
side with the incident management process as has always been the case.

Problems will be raised according to the following criteria:

e Where there is a trend of similar ‘Business’ incidents where there is no

e Where a ‘System’ incident has been raised to resolve a system problem

Problem management expands the scope of the ‘System’ incident process to
include any wider issues, which are necessary to rectify the issue. Whilst the
‘System’ incident is used within ICL Pathway to ensure the relevant code, fix
etc is developed, tested and delivered to the live estate, the Problem will
cover the specific requirements of POCL re. Counter updates, briefings etc.
and in many cases the authority to proceed with a relevant fix.
