                       POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




         SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF RODERICK MARK ISMAY




I, Roderick Mark Ismay will say as follows:

Introduction


   1.     I understand that the purpose of this witness statement is to set out

          matters of fact of which I have personal knowledge.


   2.     This witness statement was drafted in my own words with my solicitor,

          DAC Beachcroft's assistance during a process including the preparation of

          successive drafts after communications between me and those advisers in

          writing, by telephone and by video conference.


   3.     The facts within this witness statement are either within my own

          knowledge, or derive from the records provided by the Post Office Horizon

          IT Inquiry. However, as it relates to events that occurred in some cases

          over twenty years ago, there are several areas that I do not recall. Where

          that is the case, I have said so.


   4.     This statement responds to the request for a written witness statement

                                                                                WI TN04630200




        pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006 reference WITN0463R9

        (1)/LD/20240226 dated 26 February 2024. My witness statement responds

        to the questions asked in Annex 1 regarding the Post Office Horizon

        computer project.


Civil Proceedings against Ms Wolstenholme (Cleveleys)


  5.    I have considered the following documents:


           i.    POL00142503 (email to Donna Parker and others on 26 July 2004);


          ii.    POL00142504 (advice on evidence and quantum by Mr Brochwicz-

                 Lewkinski dated 26 July 2004); and


          iii.   POL00158510 and POL00158512 (emails from Carol King to me

                 dated 26 July 2004)


          iv.    POL00142505 (email from Tony Marsh to me and Tony Utting on

                 27 July 2004); and


          V.     WITN00210101 (report of Jason Coyne in POL v. Woistenholme).




  6.    I do not recall having direct involvement or giving instructions in the case

        of POL v Wolstenholme. It was not my role to instruct POL legal team or

        solicitors â€” my recollection is that there was a process or a policy for the

        management of cases and liaison with internal (POL Legal team) and

        external solicitors, and this is what appears to have happened in the most

        recent email in POL00142505. I believe that there was a role called a

        Prosecution Authority who worked closely with the Head of Criminal Law

                                                                            WI TN04630200




     and with internal legal teams, who would in turn have managed the

     relationship with external solicitors.


7.   My recollection, twenty years from the date of the documents shared in the

     Inquiry bundle, is that there was a press cutting service within POL which

     would have included all sorts of network and product news but which

     would also have included articles commenting on Horizon. My recollection

     is that I asked members of the IT Directorate what their view was about

     such articles and that Cleveleys came up in that conversation, with the IT

     Directorate firmly of a view that the criticism was unfounded. I have read

     POL00142504 and WITNO0210101 and I see that they are the opinion of

     the IT expert acting for Ms Wolstenholme on this case and the associated

     report from counsel and that those documents do raise doubt about

     Horizon. My recollection, however, is that the Post Office Head of IT, Dave

     Smith, did not agree with those opinions and that he disagreed with the

     validity of the approach adopted by the IT expert to reach their opinion_

     Rightly or wrongly, I trusted that internal opinion, from someone I

     understood to be an expert on Horizon. In POL00142503 I escalated

     Counsel's opinion to the Chief Operating Officer, David Miller, via his PA.

     This was in the absence of the Finance Director_ I expect that both would

     have had more knowledge of the early years of Horizon to take an

     additional perspective on Counsel's opinion. Later on, in the report I

     compiled in 2010, POL00088935, I did mention Cleveleys and that "..the

     defence produced a report which showed how Horizon `could' have

     caused an error and POL did not have the audit transaction logs to refute

     the claim." In hindsight I think that the report I compiled could have been

                                 Page 3 of 61
                                                                                WI TNO4630200
                                                                              WI TN04630200




     more complete if it had expanded on Counsel's opinion and the IT expert's

     opinion from 2004. However, the recollection in the 2010 report suggests

     that POL saw the lack of available transaction logs as the issue, and had

     subsequently taken action on that. Consequently, and perhaps wrongly,

     those external opinions had been rejected in 2004 and were probably a

     fading memory by 2010. For my own part, I expect that the Head of IT's

     rejection of them had probably diluted them in the wide range of topics in

     my head across all aspects of my job. I think that the previous Head of IT

     had also retired before 2010 and so the "corporate memory" of events in

     2004 would have been further diluted. I also stated in my 2010 report that

     "Systems issues have also arisen but again POL has been able to explain

     them and rectify them." I said that in recognition that some technical issues

     had arisen with Horizon however due to the comfort that was given to me

     by the Head of IT, who would have had a direct point of contact at Fujitsu

     with respect to Horizon, during the course of compiling this report, I was

     assured that the issues were resolvable. This position within POL was

     further amplified by the earlier feedback from the independent IT

     consultancy Gartner who had described the Horizon Online architecture as

     first rate.


8.   I do not know what more detailed rationale the Head of IT had, although it

     may have included the transaction logs, but I think the Gartner report on

     Horizon, which I referred to in the paper I compiled in 2010, may have first

     been mentioned to me, by him, around this time. I think, also, that I would

     have felt some reassurance regarding POL IT's stance from forums I

     attended with the NFSP (people who were users of the system and

                               Page 4 of 61
                                                                                WI TNO4630200
                                                                              WI TN04630200




      representatives of users) wherein my recollection is of a focus on branch

      conformance and training, not on doubt about Horizon. Please also see my

      comments in 13 below. I had also been asked to focus on Financial

      Services regulatory compliance and branch conformance by the Finance

      Director when I joined a few months earlier and I don't recall a sense from

      Director level, during my tenure, that they doubted Horizon, despite them

      probably having been close to it through the procurement and migration,

      as well as some being party to the correspondence about this case.


9.    I do not know whether it was my question above which led me to become

      involved in correspondence about this case or whether it may have arisen

      as a result of the Branch Audit Team reporting to me in 2004, however, I

      recognise that in POL00142503 I had collated certain information about

      this case to escalate to the Chief Operating Officer (David Miller, via his

      PA) in the absence of the Finance Director. I do not recall briefing others

      on the POL Board nor do I recall meetings with David Miller, Tony Marsh

      or Mandy Talbot, however, it is clear from the documents provided to me

      that I did have correspondence with them. I am sorry that I cannot recall

      whether this was accompanied by meetings. It is, however, the case that I

      was in my first year of employment with POL and I did have many

      introductory meetings with staff and that did include all directors at the

      time.


10.   POL00142503 includes correspondence which explains that others had

      already   considered   and    approved    settlement   payments    to   Ms

      Wolstenholme.

11.   I am asked by the Inquiry whether I read the advice of Mr Brochwicz-

      Lewinski dated 26 July 2004 and Mr Coyne's report. My immediate

      reaction was that I could not recall either name, nor whether I had even

      received either of the reports, but based on the emails provided to me I

      can see that I had at least received the first of those, because I then

      forwarded it. In the same email that I forward Counsel's Opinion, I ask

      whether Legal had a copy of the IT expert's opinion, which suggests to me

      that I did not have a copy of it, but probably wanted the recipients of the

      email to be clear about who had it if they needed it. I do not know whether

      I read either document and indeed I am unclear whether in any other

      correspondence I actually received the latter. Whether or not I did, it is my

      recollection that the IT Team had referred to the IT expert's opinion and

      had indicated that they disagreed with it, as I explained above.


12.   My understanding was that there had been a large team of experts

      involved in developing the Horizon system, that it had undergone

      extensive testing and that the independent consultancy, Gartner, had

      reported positively on the deployment of the system. I do not believe that I

      took any further action in relation to the concerns raised in Mr Coyne's

      report nor was I asked to_ My recollection is that the organisational

      priorities agreed for me at the time focussed on Financial Services

      regulatory compliance, network cash reduction, branch conformance and

      team reorganisations to support company-wide headcount reduction

      programmes_ I believe that if the Horizon system were a priority at the

      time, then it would have been a responsibility for the IT Directorate.


13.   I joined POL with an enthusiasm for the work that Post Office and

Subpostmasters did and with a respect for their roles in the community. I

think I would, therefore, have reflected more than once on the sadness of

situations involving legal action and on potential outcomes which have

been demonstrated so powerfully in the awful experiences narrated by

Subpostmasters in the Human Impact phase of this Inquiry. However,

whilst prosecution was not my decision, I think I would have rationalised it

for reasons including the following:


13.1   POL IT team's confidence in the integrity of Horizon and their

       rejection of criticism of Horizon posed in defence cases and in the

       press


13.2   POL Network Team and NFSP confidence in Horizon, including as

       users of the system,


13.3   The conclusion in 2004 of an earlier case at Sevenoaks post office,

       for which my recollection is that it was a Crown I Directly Managed

       Branch, not a sub-post office, wherein the Assistant Manager

       admitted to theft of more than half a million pounds to support his

       gambling habits


13.4   Feedback from branch auditors giving similar examples where they

       said colleagues running branches had confessed at audit to using

       post office cash for such purposes as paying off debts and using it

       to fund associated loss-making retail operations that they also ran.

       Such situations sometimes also involved branch requests for one or

       more cash deliveries to the branch, via Post Office cash delivery

       vans, where the value and frequency of the deliveries was

                          Page 7 of 61

                                                                         WI TN04630200




        disproportionate to the actual cash needs of the location. This topic

        specifically contributed to work to improve the analysis of gross

        cash turnover at a branch level (cash inflows and cash outflows) in

        order to support better decision making centrally about cash needs

        and better assurance to branches about the actual amount and

        frequency of cash deliveries that they needed based on their

        customer transactional activity


13.5    Seemingly compelling data about unusual activity in branches and

        apparent discrepancies in, or unexplained absence of, the expected

        content in pouches remitted out of branches. These themes

        included the following:


13.6    Cheques on hand â€” high values despatched for processing

        significantly late or not at all


13.7    Frequent and high value remittance reversal activity in branches at

        cash account period ends


13.8    Extensive cash to cheque reversal and re-reversal


13.9    Empty pouches or glued up pouches for returned saving stamps


13.10   Benefit transaction fraud


13.11   Manipulation of bureau de change exchange rates at a time when

        manual rates tables were used, and before central automation


13.12   "Theft and flight" cases of high value purported cash deposits into

        online banking accounts in branch followed by attempted withdrawal


                             Page 8 of 61

                                                                                  WI TN04630200




              at a bank before the alleged deposit could be investigated â€” such

              matters were monitored by a member of the Investigations

              Commercial Security Team in liaison with banks


      13.13   Situations of multiple debit or credit cards being run through branch

              terminals late at night in suspected testing of counterfeit cards


14.   I accept that the assertions above and examples of proven instances in

      certain branches are not proof that it arises elsewhere, however, I am

      sharing these perspectives to help the Inquiry understand the general

      context that may have influenced decision making in departments across

      the organisation during the period of these actions


15.   The factors above would have contributed to a general belief, within POL's

      central teams, that some level of inappropriate activity was being

      conducted in branches, whether directly managed or franchised. My

      recollection is that in the routine course of my involvement in work on

      branch conformance, I met with NFSP, with some subpostmasters and

      with some representatives of "multiple partners" (retailers who ran many

      post offices under a franchise) and that there were times when discussing

      general conformance and cash holdings where those third parties alluded

      to their own perception of the risk or even examples, that were known to

      them, of inappropriate activity.


16.   My recollection is that criminal prosecution was only followed where there

      was believed to be sufficient evidence regarding a specific individual and I

      believe that would have been a decision between the Prosecution

      Authority and POL Legal. My recollection is that there may have been

                                  Page 9 of 61
                                                                                WI TNO4630200
                                                                              WI TN04630200




      other situations wherein a civil action was taken, which I think was an

      action related to the contract. The issue of responsibility was then

      influenced by factors including the following:


      16.1   The subpostmaster contract


      16.2   Evidence of password sharing causing doubt about who may have

             performed a particular action, but with it nevertheless being the

             responsibility of the Subpostmaster under the contract


      16.3   Situations of one subpostmaster owning many (possibly dozens) of

             branches and choosing to fully delegate the running of the branches

             to other staff whom they appointed. In these situations, and in cases

             where there may have been password sharing, then my recollection

             is that auditors or investigators would seek to find out who had done

             what, but if that proved not to be possible, then again the

             subpostmaster would be considered to be responsible under the

             contract


      16.4   This had the potential to mean that a trusted employee, who might

             even be a trusted family member, might have carried out a

             suspicious transaction or taken cash, but it might just not be

             possible, for understandable reasons of friendship, for the

             subpostmaster to believe that this could have been possible


17.   Also, I believe that at some point in time, during this whole sad chain of

      events, there were comments that allegations about Horizon were

      generally raised late into proceedings and often as a retraction of previous



                                Page 10of61

                                                                                   WI TN04630200




        confessions about what had happened. I think this was an observation

        from POL Legal or from Branch Auditors or Investigators involved with

        cases. I acknowledge that the basis for this perception may now be

        challenged in hindsight by findings from Phase 4 of this Inquiry


  18.   In hindsight, I would now challenge my perception at the time, but in my

        narrative above I seek to explain the context that I and others were

        operating in at the time.

Response to the Ismay Report


  19.   I confirm I have read POL00296291 which states that I received praise

        from the Chair for my report. My recollection is that this happened at a time

        when either POL had just moved from its Old Street offices to new

        premises near Moorgate or it was at a time when there had been several

        new joiners to the organisation. I think I was being given a short tour,

        either to see the new offices or to meet new people and in the course of

        this I was introduced to the Chair. My recollection is that it was a very brief

        introduction, and the only occasion I recall on which I had direct

        conversation with that Chair. My recollection is that the comment was

        along the lines of the following "Ah pleased to meet you, so you will be Mr

        Ismay of the Ismay Report, a very good document".


  20.   As regards the comment "..and to continually rebut claims..", my

        recollection is that I was rarely included in correspondence about cases

        going to court, whereas I believe I was regularly approached by the

        Freedom of Information Act Team and the Communications Team for input

        to assist them in their responses to FOI requests and letters of complaint. I

      expect that this phrase would, therefore, have been used in respect of my

      input to assist the response to complaints and other correspondence.


21.   POL00296291, my PDR, is a quite tightly packed document spanning

      three pages and has nothing more in it about that feedback, whereas if it

      had been a major part of my work I expect that I would have wanted to

      elaborate more on it. The rest of the document demonstrates that my

      objectives and the thrust of my work had clearly been about other topics

      and I expect that I was simply keen to quote what seemed like positive

      feedback from the Chair for my summarisation in the report.


22.   Actual rebuttals of claims in legal cases would have depended on

      evidence submitted in those cases, not on the content of an internal report_

      I expect that rebuttal would also have been a decision for POL Legal or the

      Prosecution Authority based on their assessment of the evidence as it

      related to the specific branch involved in the specific case. Such evidence

      could perhaps have been actual examples related to the themes that I

      summarised from discussions with others in my report, but those examples

      would have come from relevant areas within POL.


23.   The origin of the report had not been to rebut claims â€” it had been to assist

      a new Managing Director to develop an understanding of an environment

      where challenges were being made about Horizon, but where there was

      no ready document available which pulled together reasons for assurance.


24.   POL00296291 also includes a note by me which starts with "Mute button /

      shut up". I think I would have written this in the context of development

      points for the year ahead based on feedback to me from other people in

                               Page 12of61

      the preceding year. The nature of the team that I led, was that it involved

      managing a wide variety of complex processes and such processes were

      very often impacted by wider business change projects such as new

      customer products, new channels and new systems. I was therefore often

      working in the detail, and I felt I had to work in the detail, but I was

      regularly challenged by line managers and peers to be more strategic and

      not get meetings bogged down in detail. The fact was, in my opinion, that I

      did need a grasp of the detail but I had to strike a balance in business

      meetings where POL had many massive strategic priorities (eg. Funding

      and separation from Royal Mail) such that I could be concise and effective

      when giving updates for my area. I, myself, had annual objectives and

      evolving priorities linked to these other areas â€” in particular the separation

      of POL finance processes from group wide processes, FSC input and

      readiness for IT system upgrades, Back Office Efficiency Programme,

      tenders and supplier relations around cheques and card processing, team

      restructuring for headcount reduction and team support for branch cover

      during strike action.


25.   This report that I compiled was a summary of the existing understanding of

      teams across the organisation. I do not, therefore, believe that the report

      itself would have been something that POL used or relied on in its

      response or in devising its strategy to the response, but rather the

      individual elements of       potential assurance     noted    within   it,    as

      communicated by functional leaders across the organisation, would have

      been matters that would already have caused POL to have belief in

      Horizon, and would continue to do so.

   26.   The report has an addressee list at the top of it and my recollection is that

         my conversations during the compilation of the report would have been

         with those individuals or with members of their teams that they asked me

         to speak to. As regards specific members of POL Board, I do not recall

         which "directors" (members of the POL Executive Team) were also

         members of the POL Board, however, the ET members that I believe I

         spoke with in compiling the report were Mike Young and Mike Moores. The

         report was then primarily addressed to Dave Smith but, as he was the one

         seeking the understanding from across the business (and was relatively

         new to the company), I don't recall that I had much conversation with him

         about it aside from being asked to compile the report. I believe that the

         request for me to compile the report arose due to a lack of clarity of

         Horizon sponsors within POL, but that from a recent visit to Chesterfield it

         was clear that I and my team had a good knowledge of Branch accounting.

Shoosmiths litigation


   27.   I have reviewed POL00046944, POL00294879 and POL00027523 and I

         think I would have been involved in three ways in this matter.


   28.   Firstly, in light of the then recent document referred to as The Ismay

         Report, I think that upon the receiving the letter of claim, POL Legal Team

         would have approached me to assist in suggesting what people or teams

         would need to be involved in responding to the topics within the letter.


   29.   Secondly, I would most likely have been involved as the Head of Product &

         Branch Accounting wherein I or members of my team would have been

         best able to answer specific questions about accounting processes.


                                   Page 14 of 61
                                                                                   WI TNO4630200
                                                                                 WI TN04630200




30.   Thirdly, I think I was replaying to the Legal Team what they would have

      told me in the first place â€” claims would not have been addressed to me,

      they would have been sent to Legal or Head Office as indeed

      POL00046944 was. I think it was probably a situation of different members

      of the Legal Team knowing about different cases and a range of people in

      other teams providing input to different cases, but no one having a

      summary of it all. I think I then volunteered to trawl through information to

      summarise it, in the absence of anyone else volunteering to. I think this is

      symptomatic of other strands being considered in this Inquiry and perhaps

      a reflection of the high levels of staff turnover in some teams â€” I think I

      might have volunteered or been approached to collate things, and then

      become a magnet for that, when someone else should have been

      responsible and should have done it, or indeed it should have been

      information readily to hand in another team. This probably also led to me

      gathering addressees' thoughts together in the proposal I made in

      POL00294879.


31.   My recollection is that the POL Legal Team would have then led on the

      response to the letter of claim. I do not recall that I or others were assigned

      specific roles or responsibilities, other than that actions may have been

      agreed such as fact finding about processes or records which may have

      been relevant actions for me. I do not recall that this was a situation of an

      "appointment" but rather that in any business situation where you have to

      gather information, you get the people involved who represent the relevant

      teams or processes for gathering such information.


32.   I do not consider that I can describe a strategy for POL's response. Rather
                                Page 15 of 61
                                                                                     WI TNO4630200
                                                                                   WI TN04630200




         I would say that the letter of claim set out a situation and I believe the POL

         Legal Team would have determined how that would be responded to and,

         in that sense, would have been responsible for strategy.


   33.   My recollection is that POL Legal Team or the third party lawyers

         supporting POL advised that correspondence should be headed in a

         certain way to retain legal professional privilege. My understanding was

         that this was a common principle in the legal profession for solicitors and

         their clients, which I presume would be relevant for all legal cases, and so

         would not be unusual to be used in this situation. At some point in time (I

         do not recall whether it was before or after this situation) POL issued

         guidance on document categorisation (eg. Confidential etc) and I believe

         that this also would be common practice across organisations. I do not

         believe that I was aware, if at all, of POL seeking to prevent disclosure of

         documents but rather that it had been felt necessary, corporately, to

         reinforce to people the importance of document categorisation in a solicitor

         / client context.

Response to Private Eye Inquiry


   34.   I have considered POL00294843 and do not recall this specific inquiry, but

         I think that I was asked to provide input from time to time on enquiries that

         may have come in to POL. Such enquiries might have been first received

         as Freedom of Information Act requests or letters to the Managing Director

         and I think were forwarded to me from time to time by the related teams in

         London. My recollection is that those enquiries were from individuals not

         journalists, however, this document shows that there were journalistic



                                   Page 16of61
                                                                                     WI TNO4630200
                                                                                   WI TN04630200




         enquiries too. There were obviously also situations of articles in the press

         which were not a specific question addressed to POL but which were a

         general comment in the media which may or may not have merited a

         response.


   35.   I do recall at some point that I queried with the PR Team whether there

         was merit in attempting to respond with a summary of POL's reasons for

         assurance such as training, IT model office and helplines etc but I believe

         the response was that it would be very hard to provide a simple and

         concise summary of such matters and that it could rather be interpreted as

         a "tit for tat" which would just exacerbate the situation. This is potentially

         the type of feedback which led to the comment I made in POL00296291

         about "mute button / shut up" and which is commented on above in

         paragraph 24 of this statement.

Appointment of Second Sight and its investigation


   36.   I confirm that I have reviewed the documents the Inquiry has asked me to

         consider,   namely;    POL00184724,        POL00184725,      POL00184726,

         POL00184727,        P0L00097548,         POL00185683,        P0L00098035,

         P0L00130162, P0L00130163 and P0L00130164.


   37.   I do not believe that I ever met with the JFSA, however, my recollection is

         that some other colleagues had met with them and that Second Sight had

         either been proposed by JFSA or had in some way been identified as a

         firm to consider and that it had then been mutually agreed between POL

         and JFSA that they would be appointed. I apologise if I am wrong in that,

         but this is my recollection. Having now read Second Sight's Interim Report,


                                   Page 17of61
                                                                              WI TNO4630200
                                                                            WI TN04630200




      POL00090567, I see that Second Sight themselves set out a short

      summary of the origin of their appointment and the remit agreed for their

      work at the top of the first page of their Interim Report. In their Part 2

      Report, POL00029849, Second Sight comment at 1.2 that they were

      appointed by Post Office at the request of Members of Parliament. I was

      not involved in commissioning Second Sight or in the preparation of their

      mandate. I believe, their primary point of contact would have been the

      Legal Team or Angela Van Den Bogerd.


38.   I did not meet with any MPs myself, but I was involved in some information

      gathering ahead of a meeting with MPs in May 2010. A briefing paper was

      compiled for that meeting (POL00002082) as shared in Bundle R10 last

      year. I would have been involved in explaining some of the processes

      narrated in that briefing paper.


39.   1 do not recall that I was involved in the appointment and instruction of

      Second Sight. I did, however, attend at least one meeting with Second

      Sight and I did correspond with them in response to questions that they

      asked. My recollection of a specific meeting is of one regarding the

      Suspense Account. This is expanded on later in this statement.


40.   My recollection had been that Second Sight were appointed to look into

      specific cases put forward by JFSA. My recollection from the one meeting

      that I recall with them was that they felt some cases merited further

      investigation by them but that they or JFSA felt some other cases did not

      have validity. I believe that these cases are what is referred to as "spot

      reviews". Having been able to read POL00090567 I have then been


                                Page 18of61
                                                                               WI TNO4630200
                                                                             WI TN04630200




      reminded of the communication that was sent out to subpostmasters and

      counter colleagues which invited them to submit issues confidentially to

      JFSA. That same document explained that the objectives of Second

      Sight's work were somewhat broader in advising on whether there were

      any systemic issues or concerns (page 1) but that the approach adopted to

      develop such advice would be based on spot reviews (pages 2-3).


41.   I do not recall who at POL was responsible for deciding the ambit of

      Second Sight's investigation and the extent of its access to documentation


42.   My recollection is that large amounts of information were provided to

      Second Sight and that large amounts of time were made available for

      discussion with them. The lengthy correspondence that I was party to with

      them, regarding the suspense account, is an example of that.


43.   My recollection is that Second Sight's initial scope was about spot reviews

      and my feeling from my recollections is that sufficient information was

      being provided by POL. The nature of the two Second Sight reports that

      the Inquiry has shared with me suggests that either the agreed scope

      evolved or there was a divergence of opinion about what the scope was. In

      that regard I do not know whether the extent of provision of information

      was sufficient.


44.   My recollection regarding spot reviews is that there would have been

      specific questions about the transactional history in a branch and perhaps

      about specific products being transacted. I believe that I would have been

      providing or gathering the response from a transactional and process

      sense about such matters. My recollection is that rather than it being a

                               Page 19of61
                                                                                   WI TN04630200
                                                                                 WI TN04630200




        "strategy" POL would simply have been seeking to fully answer the

         questions raised during the course of a spot review. My recollection is also

         that, although I made a proposal for process in POL00184724, there was a

         point at which it was agreed that spot reviews would be followed up direct

         by colleagues in London with members of my team, rather than through

        me. This was potentially due to a broader prioritisation wherein I needed to

         be focussed on the Finance Roadmap project and other follow-ons to the

         separation of POL processes arising from Royal Mail privatisation.


  45.   I cannot recall the Second Sight Weekly Calls, however, given that I

         believe POL was responding to the spot reviews I would expect that the

        weekly calls were a status check on the progress of such responses. In

         that regard, as explained above, I or my team may have been the people

         best placed to respond to specific topics in the spot reviews.

      xxxii.   UKGI00000018 (POL's response to Second Sight's Part 2 report).


47.    My recollection is that my involvement in POL's response to Second

       Sight's reports was, as explained above, to provide or gather the response

       to specific questions from a transactional and process sense.


48.    Whilst I believe I responded to a variety of questions over a period of time,

       I cannot recall whether they related to the Mediation Scheme as well as to

       Second Sight's questions.


49.    I cannot recall what my views were at the time, on the conclusions reached

       in the interim report. However, having read that report as part of preparing

       this witness statement I think that my perception would have been that it

       was written in a balanced manner, acknowledging all of the following â€”

       firstly the fact that the subpostmaster experience was not just about

       Horizon but also about other aspects of the environment around it such as

       training and connectivity, secondly that the situations in the spot reviews

       were not straightforward, thirdly that it was hard for POL to prove the

       negative, but fourthly that this was the same situation that subpostmasters

       may have found themselves in too. Aside from the work on Spot Reviews

       and the work to explain the suspense account, I do not recall how actions

       were taken forward from the report, but I would expect that this would have

       been under the direction of those responsible for co-ordinating the Second

       Sight work, which I believe was POL Legal or Angela Van Den Bogerd.


50.    As regards the assertion that "there is often a focus on `asset recover



                                Page 23 of 61
                                                                             WI TNO4630200
                                                                           WI TN04630200




solutions' without first establishing the underlying root cause of the

problem" I agree that, in isolation, the explanation of the cases does sound

like that. However, in a wider context, I would say that significant effort was

already being put into, and continued to be put into, eliminating the scope

for errors and complexity in the first place. I would say that the priority

given to me regarding loss reduction in my time at POL was by way of

eliminating loss making products and making customer transactions and

end of day routines (such as cheque despatch) easier to transact. It was

not about `asset recovery' as the priority â€” it was about prevention in the

first place and this spirit was reflected in articles that I initiated in POL's

branch publications and in articles that I contributed to the NFSP

Subpostmaster magazine. The Back Office Efficiency Programme and

other central initiatives had a focus on ceasing certain problem products

(primarily Post Office Saving Stamps) and on providing an easier and

clearer data flow for "off-Horizon" services (products served through stand-

alone equipment), to enable branches to examine, challenge and accept

the transaction summaries via "Ping" (a topic that I addressed in my first

witness statement). "Off-Horizon" products meant products such as

Camelot and PayStation whereby batch summaries could be sent as

"Transaction Acknowledgements" (TA's) to branches which the branch

could validate against local receipts before accepting the TA, rather than

the branch have to remember to do the weekly processes such as

Camelot cut-off. These central initiatives directly match to the issues

included in some of the spot reviews referred to in POL00090567 as they

were already more widely recognised as complicated routines.

                                                                             WI TN04630200




51.   With the passage of time my view remains that whilst, in isolation, the

      conduct of the individual cases looked like a prioritisation of "asset

      recover", my experience of driving improvements through Back Office

      Efficiency Programme (BOEP) is very much the opposite â€” initiatives such

      as BOEP were focussed on preventing the scope for issues to arise in the

      first place.


52.   Regarding POL00145290 I think that the distinction being made through

      the word "anomalies" versus "bugs" was an effort, made in good faith, to

      pre-empt what one might expect the typical layman's response to be to the

      word bug. By that, I mean that these bullet points in this email were

      responding to what were understood to be two matters that affected what

      was believed to be a small number of offices and which arose due to an

      unexpected and unlikely sequence of menu options being followed. This is

      probably why I used the word anomaly. "Bug" on the other hand is a word

      for an issue that I would suggest one would naturally expect to affect all

      users in the routine course of operations â€” a matter which did not apply to

      the two issues named in that email ie. Only a small and defined number of

      offices experienced the two issues (the "anomalies").


53.   Further, in response to POL00145290, I did not say that the Interim Report

      referred to anomalies. What the first bullet point of my email was meant to

      convey, and which I feel it does convey, is that regardless of whether you

      call them anomalies or bugs, the specific branches who experienced the

      two named issues were not members of the population of branches

      making up the 47 cases or the 4 cases.

                                                                              WI TN04630200




54.   The interim report by Second Sight, POL00090567 states on page 1 that

      "..the remit of the investigation was later defined as to consider and to

      advise on whether there are any systemic issues and/or concerns with the

      Horizon system'..." I believe that the comment 'we welcome the

      conclusion of this interim report that there are no systemic issues with the

      Horizon system" would have been made in the context of that remit stated

      on page 1 and Second Sight's preliminary conclusion at 8.2(a) which says

      "We have so far found no evidence of system wide (systemic) problems

      with the Horizon software."


55.   I cannot recall the Horizon regular call, however, as I explained earlier in

      this statement, I would expect that weekly calls were a status check on the

      progress of responses to the spot reviews. In that regard, as explained

      above, I or my team may have been the people best placed to respond to

      specific topics in the spot reviews.


56.   As regards notes and/or minutes I have read POL00083932 including the

      specific comments. I can't recall anything to add to what already exists in

      that document and which has been highlighted in the question to me. I do

      not know what was discussed to lead to those notes being made, other

      than what is stated within the document itself. The notes of my own input

      to that meeting, included in POL00083932, do not touch on that topic.


57.   I do not know what discussion, if any, there was of the Helen Rose report

      on 31 July 2013. However, I presume that the Inquiry asks about 31 July

      2013 in this section on the basis that there may have been a Horizon call

      on that date. If so, then based on the comment on page 1 of


                                Page 26 of 61
                                                                                  WI TNO4630200
                                                                                WI TN04630200




      POL00083932 that "No minutes circulated, but we will be taking notes"

      then the note taker for POL00083932 might have prepared a similar note

      regarding whatever was discussed on 31 July 2013.


58.   I do not believe that I was aware, during my tenure, of allegations that a

      person within POL had made instructions to shred or otherwise destroy

      notes of calls. In subsequent years, after leaving POL, I have, however,

      seen comments in the press and on social media about shredding.


59.   I cannot recall reading what has become known as the Helen Rose report

      and I cannot recall, during my tenure at POL, hearing of a document with

      that name. I apologise if this is not the case and if I have simply forgotten.

      However, as a result of reading the bundle of papers shared with me to

      assist in preparing this statement, I have now read that report. I would

      imagine that at the time it was first prepared and shared it would have

      simply been called a report on the specific spot review, or perhaps referred

      to by the name of the specific post office if it were not sensitive to mention

      the name of the office. I do, however, note that this report refers to a

      transaction recovery situation and I do recall that I asked questions about

      the transaction recovery process during my tenure at POL as "recovery"

      did seem like a complex area. I don't know if my question would have been

      prompted by general experience or perhaps by this very report and the

      response to spot reviews. My recollection is that detailed guidance had

      been given about the process for branches to follow in a recovery situation

      but my recollection is that I felt this could have been complex for a branch

      to follow. I think this was both in terms of how to describe the

      technologically complex recovery situation in straightforward intuitive terms
                                Page 27 of 61
                                                                                  WI TNO4630200
                                                                                WI TN04630200




      and also how to enact such processes in what might be a stressful

      situation as there could quite likely be a dis-satisfied customer and one or

      more counter staff upset that they had not been able to deliver the service

      they would wish for that customer. I think I sought to get simpler guidance

      on recovery issued but I cannot recall whether that was, in the end,

      appropriate or agreed or enacted.


60.   Regarding the FactFile, POL00201858 shows that I felt several sections

      needed rewording or expanding and that the owners (presumably meaning

      the reviewers too) needed revisiting for some sections. Based on the dates

      of the emails I expect that I received the draft on Thursday 13th, reviewed it

      on Friday 14th and sent back my summary comments first thing on Monday

      17th but the document had already been shared in the meantime. I am

      unclear whether POL00201859 is then the version showing exactly what I

      proposed as edits or whether it includes any other people's proposed

      amendments to the same areas.


61.   Regardless of whether it is or isn't, my suggested additions would have

      been based on my understanding at the time, and likely to have been

      subsequently considered and reviewed by Angela Van Den Bogerd as per

      POL00201858. This may have involved me checking with other people on

      the Friday or in whatever time gap I was suddenly given to respond in light

      of the urgency conveyed by the email in POL00201858.


62.   The text at paragraph 33 is consistent with the understanding that I had at

      the time of the report to the Managing Director in 2010 and consistent with

      my continued understanding from the IT directorate at the time. I think I

                                                                                 WI TNO4630200
                                                                               WI TN04630200




      would   have    felt   that   Transaction    Corrections   and   Transaction

      Acknowledgements needed referring to in that section as at some point in

      time there had been questions suggesting that people thought TCs and

      TAs were a mechanism to directly insert records into Horizon without the

      branch seeing them and being able to review and formally accept or reject

      them; a perspective that was not the case.


63.   My recollection is that I was involved at various times in providing input or

      identifying other relevant teams for input, in response to a wide range of

      questions and reviews. Some questions included reports related to the

      matters in this Inquiry but other questions would have related to reviews

      such as for strands of the Back Office Efficiency Programme, for lean

      process improvement work, for central system migration projects, for

      P&BA areas impacted by Horizon upgrades (including an aborted attempt

      to explore an alternative point of sale system), for process understanding

      related to tenders and new suppliers for cheque processing and card

      processing, for routine internal and external audit, for POL separation as

      part of Royal Mail privatisation and for process reviews linked to

      headcount reduction programmes. I think there were other reviews too,

      again not related to Horizon.


64.   Given the range of process reviews mentioned above, I am sorry that I

      cannot remember how to differentiate my involvement with considering

      and responding to Second Sight's interim report or to the establishment

      and running of the Mediation Scheme, but I would expect that my

      involvement would have been in just the same way as I have already

      explained in several sections above, wherein I or my team may have been
                                Page 29 of 61

                                                                           WI TN04630200




      the people best placed to respond to specific topics. In that regard, the

      documents shared with me by the Inquiry show that I had significant

      involvement in responses to questions about suspense accounts. Other

      topics that I appear to have had input on include transactional processes

      for several products served at the counter or in branch.


65.   I cannot recall the nature and extent of any involvement I had in POL's

      response to applications made to the Mediation Scheme. As above, I

      would, however, expect any involvement again to be due to me or my

      team being the people best placed to respond to specific topics.


66.   I cannot recall, and do not know if I knew at the time, who at POL was

      responsible for its strategy responding to applications to the Mediation

      Scheme.


67.   In addition to the areas underlying the questions which I have answered

      above, I do not recall what other input, if any, I may have made to POL's

      response to complaints made by subpostmasters concerning the Horizon

      IT system. However, I do recall that I had other direct dialogue with

      subpostmasters which may have been initiated as a consequence of the

      work with Second Sight. At some point, a forum of a small number of

      subpostmasters was convened and I think this group had at least one

      meeting, and maybe more, in Chesterfield and possibly in London. I

      cannot recall for sure what the group was called (possibly the Branch

      Forum?) nor whether the subpostmasters in the group had been chosen

      as part of some wider exercise. Nevertheless the group did meet and I

      believe I introduced several of my team to them, such that we could

                                                                                WI TNO4630200
                                                                              WI TN04630200




      explain more about the processes in Chesterfield and about how the P&BA

      team (or subsequently the FSC team) worked with branches. Moreover,

      during one family holiday we happened to have a cottage near to the post

      office run by one of the group and I agreed with my family for me to spend

      some time in branch with the particular subpostmaster to consolidate on

      what was probably a recent meeting of that forum.


68.   I was briefly asked about suspense accounts in the questions for my first

      witness statement, which involved review of document POL00022297. I

      was not able to recall the related discussions, however, I noted that it

      appears that I set out the breadth of scenarios that arise across different

      products and that it was not a short or simple thing to explain all those

      variations. The implication appeared to be that I could not give a short

      answer.


69.   The bundle shared with me this year includes several more documents

      which I can now see originate from a question asked by Second Sight in

      an email included in POL00205842. I can see that I was then involved in a

      number of iterations of explanations to respond to the question.


70.   I believe that the one meeting that I do remember attending with Second

      Sight, was also with Alisdair Cameron, in POL's London offices. I think this

      was probably the meeting being anticipated in POLOO218943 where there

      was a reference to putting me "through his paces."


71.   I cannot recall what preparatory meetings, if any, may actually have taken

      place to put me "through his paces" and I would like to think that I had a

      clear enough understanding of what appears to have been a technically

                               Page 31 of61
                                                                                  WI TNO4630200
                                                                                WI TN04630200




      complex account, in order to fully assist in explaining the account and

      answering questions about it on the day. However, as has been noted in

      POL00296291 I had previously been challenged in annual appraisals

      about droning on and not being succinct enough (ie. I would sometimes

      confuse the listener or the reader with repetition and unnecessary detail,

      rather than succinctly get to the point). This was clearly a learning point I

      had attempted to take on board from that previous year's annual review

      and probably from ongoing feedback â€” I expect that this was the origin of

      others suggesting that I should be put "through his paces."


72.   As regards other meetings on this, I cannot recall meeting with Second

      Sight again but I think I was involved in several iterations of a document

      that other items in the bundle show as an expanding piece of work. I may

      have corresponded direct with Second Sight or I may have corresponded

      via one or more of the other Post Office staff mentioned in the emails.


73.   I do, however, believe that I met with Alisdair Cameron in Chesterfield and

      in London to explain this and other unrelated topics. Those other unrelated

      topics included understanding supplier invoices and the status of central IT

      system projects following on from POL separation after Royal Mail

      privatisation. I don't recall the content of the conversations but I do recall

      that the style of the conversation was positively probing. I explained in

      paragraph 24 above regarding POL00296291 that I was regularly

      challenged by line managers and peers to be more strategic and not get

      meetings bogged down in detail â€” I do believe that I felt somewhat

      reassured but also positively challenged that Alisdair, who had a strong

      strategic focus, wanted to work through the detail of how such things as
                                Page 32 of 61

      suspense and supplier invoices worked. I think that he felt POL needed to

      be able to respond faster and more clearly to Second Sight and that he

      wanted to be able to give the necessary level of detail in the answers to

      save Second Sight from having to ask follow up questions that we might

      be able to anticipate, given that the work had already been going on so

      long. In working with Second Sight, I believe I was neutral. I can see that

      the situations were complex and I would have probably felt that there were

      helpful process improvements that might come to light even if Horizon was

      not faulty. My sense from the documents shared with me is that there were

      indeed such areas being noted in the Spot Reviews eg. The understanding

      of "Recovery" and the understanding, rationale and review of receipts

      printed by Horizon.


74.   Second Sight posed the question as to whether SPMs may have paid for

      alleged shortfalls that became profits in POL's or its clients' suspense

      accounts. I was involved in compiling POL's responses to that question

      and POL00025783 included product examples, process explanations and

      a rationale for why this was considered not to be the case.


75.   In my role as Head of Finance Service Centre, I felt I had a good

      understanding of the accounting processes, including client data matching

      routines and associated inquiry routines, which were overseen by my team

      in Chesterfield. The specific examples in POL00025783 supplemented by

      my wider understanding of the routines across my team would have been

      the reason for my view that SPMs were not paying for profits in POL's or

      its clients' suspense accounts.

76.   1 do acknowledge the fair point that Second Sight made at the end of

      POL00218946 wherein they respond to a comment about data from

      Regulated and Audited Entities and they say "We therefore reject the

      assertion that data emanating from such entities can be so heavily relied

      upon that there is no need to check it." What I would like to add here is that

      teams in the FSC did not assume that client data was always right â€” the

      results from comparing branch data against client data via the central data

      matching routines could lead to enquiries being raised with either party

      (the client or the branch or both). There was, for example, a suspense

      balance some years before the period that Second Sight asked about

      wherein POL was confident that it owed funds to another national

      institution but the other institution disagreed. A National Audit Office report

      into that institution then came to light which I believe had challenged the

      accounting processes at that organisation and this, with further discussion

      between the parties, led to a conclusion that POL data should be relied on

      and that the client data was not right. This is an example that supports

      Second Sight's challenge but also shows that POL had proven examples

      of identifying and challenging such matters itself, not simply leaving a

      balance in suspense to be taken to profit.


77.   As regards the question of whether analysis of POL's or its client's

      suspense accounts could identify whether any SPMs had paid to settle

      illusory losses generated by Horizon, it was not mine or POL's view at the

      time that there were illusory losses. However, if we do explore the premise

      of illusory losses then if an illusory transaction and a consequent illusory

      accounting double entry were to have happened in branch (or if a

                                Page 34 of 61
                                                                                WI TNO4630200
                                                                              WI TN04630200




      transaction and double entry that should have been recorded failed to be

      recorded) then we would have to explore whether the same illusory

      transaction or lost transaction would manifest itself in the same way in the

      data or paper stream to the client (and potentially to the method of

      payment processor for cheques or cards) as well as to the transactional

      data stream being harvested from Horizon to the FSC. The investigation

      process would vary between client transaction types and whether there

      was an additional off-Horizon device involved, or customer paperwork to

      be sent off or method of payment batches to be sent off. The central

      matching processes should have enabled an issue to be identified if it

      affected just one data stream, but if there were an illusory transaction

      reflected in both the POL data stream and in the client data stream, or if a

      genuine transaction were missing from both, then the FSC matching

      routine would not raise an issue as both data streams would be the same.


78.   I apologise that, despite my development point to be more succinct, I have

      had to use lengthy narrative above. This is, however, a necessary

      reflection of the complexity and diversity of the products and processes

      that SPMs had to manage in branch and that similarly confronted central

      processing teams. My recollection is that such processes were well

      documented, and were believed to run effectively, but were subject to

      regular update due to changes in products and branches as well as to

      matters such as LEAN process improvements, and therefore the related

      documentation would need regular update as expanded on further in a

      later section of this statement. It was complex and it again reinforces the

      challenge that Second Sight acknowledged of how hard it is to disprove a

                               Page 35 of 61
                                                                                   WI TNO4630200
                                                                                 WI TN04630200




      negative.


79.   At the time, based on the general but perhaps misplaced confidence in

      Horizon and in its related processes, and in light of the credits or write offs

      agreed for the known issues disclosed to Second Sight and referenced in

      their Interim Report, my recollection is that neither I nor POL believed that

      there were illusory losses nor that SPM's were paying for alleged shortfalls

      that generated profits for POL.


80.   Whilst my memory of process detail has inevitably faded, I would have

      continued to hold the same view purely from my recollection of FSC

      processes and from my re-reading of the documents that I was originally

      involved in preparing, which are now included in the bundle for this witness

      statement. However, I would be less confident to say that now, with

      hindsight, in light of the increased concern about Horizon that has arisen

      through this Inquiry.


81.   I cannot recall how involved I was in respect of what documentation was

      provided to Second Sight, however, the indication that I was being

      challenged about my ability to present a simple answer for the Suspense

      Account suggests that I was tending to produce extensive detail.


82.   As explained earlier, I was involved in preparing or reviewing a wide range

      of documents for a wide range of projects across the company. I cannot

      therefore recall exactly what I was responding to and the extent of my

      involvement in each one individually, however, from review of the

      documents shared with me for this statement I can see that I was heavily

      involved in responses to the suspense account aspects of the Second

                                                                                WI TN04630200




         Sight reports and that I reviewed the Factfile POL00201859 which I

         presume arose as part of responding to a Second Sight paper. I believe

         that in making any responses about accounting processes I would have

         satisfied myself due to mine and my team's experience of the branch and

         client facing processes in FSC.


   83.   I cannot rememberwhether I was consulted as part of the decision making

         to terminate Second Sight's engagement, but I was not the owner of the

         relationship with them, I did not initiate their appointment and I would

         certainly not have been in a position to terminate it. It is clear from the

         documents in my bundle that I was involved in responses to their review

         for at least a two year period. I was, however, operating as a respondee to

         questions, not as an owner of the relationship with Second Sight.

Project Zebra


   84.   I confirm I have read the following documents:


           I.    POL00105635 (Deloitte Project Zebra â€” Phase 1 Report: Draft â€”

             on 23rd May 2014).


       v.    POL00028062 (Deloitte â€” Horizon Desktop Review of Assurance

             Sources and Key Control Features, Draft for Discussion, dated 23

             May 2014);


       vi.   POL00028069 (Deloitte Board Briefing, Document, further to our

             report "Horizon: Desktop review of assurance sources and key

             identified by POL as critical to POL's legal position); and


      vii.   POL00031410 and POL00031411 (Chris Aujard's papers on

             Project Zebra).


85.   The purpose of Project Zebra appears to be set out in point 2.1 of

      POL00031410. As I said in my first statement, I cannot recall anything to

      cause me to suggest any other description for their involvement than is

      given in the introduction to that document.


86.   I clearly became involved in providing information for this project and in

      responding to documents associated with it, but I do not recall that I was

      involved in proposing this project or in defining its scope, except for the

      proposal referenced as A4 which I made and which then became part of

      POL00031410. As I have explained in earlier paragraphs related to other

      reports, I was typically involved where I or my team may have been the

      people best placed to explain particular accounting processes.


87.   I was not involved in proposing this project or in defining its scope, I do,


                                Page 38 of 61
                                                                                    WI TN04630200
                                                                                  WI TN04630200




      however, believe that at some point I was asked by the then Finance

      Director or by a peer in Finance Lead Team for my thoughts on which firm

      from a shortlist of the largest audit firms would be most independent from

      POL and therefore best able to be seen to give the most independent and

      objective view in a non-audit project. I think that question arose in a

      process which led to Deloitte being selected for the piece of work and in

      light of the documents in this bundle I expect it was for Project Zebra


88.   1 don't recall and I don't know if I knew at the time, why POL commissioned

      a review of assurance sources. Point 2.1 of POL00031410 sets out who

      commissioned Project Zebra. Point 3.2 of POL00031410 states that

      Deloitte did not test any of the relevant Horizon features. I do not recall

      being asked to consider commissioning them to do testing and I do not

      know what the actual commissioners of the report considered.


89.   I recall that I met members of an engagement team from Deloitte in

      Chesterfield and I presume that would have been to do with this project.

      On that presumption, I think I would have given them an overview of the

      processes of the FSC and of the data flows from Horizon into FSC

      systems.


90.   1 cannot recall what my views were on the reports produced by Deloitte,

      however, I clearly felt that a recommendation referenced as A4 in

      POL00031410 needed editing. Nine years on from that report I cannot

      recall exactly what I thought at the time, however, I have read my

      proposed edit and I continue to believe that it was an appropriate

      interjection for the following reasons. I believe that the wording of Deloitte's


                                Page 39 of 61
                                                                          WI TN04630200
                                                                        WI TN04630200




draft recommendation in the table in Appendix 1 of POL00031410 could be

read as suggesting that FSC could make adjustments to SPM ledgers and

that FSC did reconciliations to the Audit Store, whereas I believed at the

time (and my view has not changed) that FSC could only propose

Transaction Corrections and Transaction Acknowledgements which would

be sent to SPMs for their review and their acceptance or rejection in

Horizon, rather than it being the case that FSC directly put an adjustment

into Horizon. If FSC had been able to make adjustments into Horizon this

would have undermined the principle of branch ownership and would have

meant that FSC could become a bad actor or be accused of being one. It

was always held as important that it should only be the SPM or their own

staff who make the entries in Horizon (including formally accepting or

rejecting TCs and TAs). FSC might spot an issue and notify the branch of

it, but this had to be done in a way where the branch had control of any

actual entry into Horizon. I believe that I would have seen it as

fundamental to make that distinction and I continue to believe, based on

the documents shared with me, that this was a wholly appropriate and

wholly constructive proposed amendment. My proposed edit also

explained what I understood to be the format difference between data in

Horizon versus data in the Audit Store versus data batched by client for

settlement routines in FSC â€” FSC did not do reconciliations against the

Audit Store and I must have felt strongly that this needed clarifying too. I

feel that I then set out an onerous and open commitment for FSC

involvement in documentation of processes and controls in FSC and in the

data pipeline from point of sale to central finance systems. I continue to


                         Page 40 of 61
                                                                                 WI TNO4630200
                                                                               WI TN04630200




        believe that this was an open, constructive and extensive proposal. FSC

        already had lots of documentation of processes and it had been reviewing

        them as part of LEAN process improvement work and as part of routine

        business continuity work. Given the frequency of new product deployment

        in branches and online, and changes to central systems such as on

        separation from Royal Mail, it was recognised that there was an ongoing

        need to maintain and update business process documentation. This was

        common business practice and would have benefits for training new staff,

        maintaining process knowledge when people leave, for good governance

        and for general business continuity.


  91.   Deloitte produced detailed reports and recommendations. I don't know

        whether it met its intended purpose and I think that would be a matter for

        the commissioners of the report to comment on.


  92.   1 do not recall and I don't know if I knew at the time, how POL used the

        Project Zebra reports. That said, the edited proposal for ensuring

        comprehensive documentation of key processes in FSC was very much a

        priority within FSC anyway as it was important to the ongoing LEAN

        process reviews within the team and indeed was good practice for any

        organisation. This would therefore have continued regardless of Project

        Zebra.

Tim Parker's Review


  93.   I was clearly involved, as a key process owner, in responding to a

        succession of reviews and reports. I do not recall having been in a meeting

        with Tim Parker for such a review and I do not recall being involved in

          instructing Sir Jonathan Swift â€” that would have been a matter for the

          Legal team. My recollection is that I met Tim Parker on two occasions.

          Firstly in a general POL Leadership Forum which would have been of the

          nature of a strategic update generally on company performance, not about

          this topic. Secondly as part of a series of Exec Member visits to POL

          administrative sites around the country â€” he visited Chesterfield en route to

          Dearne and my recollection is that this was for general staff Q&A sessions

          and to walk the floor to meet the teams.


  94.     I do not recall what report became called the Swift Review nor whether I

          read it. I presume that it was a follow on to the matters noted in

          POL00006356. I left the Post Office about a month after the date of that

          document and I do not recall whether I received further reports for input or

          review in that time.

General


  95.     With the hindsight of reading the many documents shared with me for this

          Inquiry and having reflected on my time at POL, I continue to believe that I

          and my teams were focussed on making branch and client transaction

          processes as easy as possible from point of sale through to FSC and on to

          clients themselves. This was intended to be of benefit to Subpostmasters

          and other colleagues in branch and to be of benefit in central POL

          processes. For Subpostmasters, it was intended to help them get it right

          first time and to save them time when serving customers and when doing

          administrative routines. For central POL functions, it was intended to have

          benefits in terms of reducing enquiries, reducing the need for interventions



                                   Page 42 of 61
                                                                                 WI TNO4630200
                                                                               WI TN04630200




      such as Transaction Corrections and to improve the experience for

      customers and for corporate clients. I and my team received positive

      feedback for my work on that from POL management, from NFSP, from

      unions and from individual branch operators including subpostmasters and

      other franchise partners. This was done against a wider backdrop of

      enormous change for POL with new products, new systems, new partners,

      new funding, network restructuring, Royal Mail privatisation, exploration of

      mutualisation, change of suppliers and frequent strike action.


96.   That said, it is also very clear that an awful chain of events took place for

      the subpostmasters who have suffered in this scandal, and that pain

      continues. I am sorry for that.


97.   In hindsight, I wish that I could go back and do the following to have

      helped change the sequence of events:


      97.1   Challenge IT to explain why they rejected the IT expert's opinion in

             the Cleveleys case


      97.2   Challenge the corporate over-confidence in Horizon and in its

             support processes in light of the allegations against the system in

             various cases and in various items of media comment


      97.3   Challenge the Legal Team, in the West Byfleet case, regarding

             exactly what was needed, if anything, in response to the request

             that I received third hand about a possible defence visit to

             Chesterfield. I would always have wanted to ensure that everything

             was done that needed to be done, but in this case a third hand

                                                                              WI TN04630200




             request was vague. I and my teams were always very stretched,

             with our roles supporting many transformational programmes, and

             so additional unclarified requests for more work would be unlikely to

             have been the most welcome developments, but if something

             needed doing we would absolutely have done it. We just needed to

             know and, in this case, it would have needed the POL Legal Team

             to be clear about what had been agreed by POL and what needed

             doing.


      97.4   Agree and document a terms of reference for the report that I

             compiled in 2010, and make clear to the audience for that report,

             and to future readers if necessary, that it was simply a summary of

             the reasons for assurance at the time, as had been requested, and

             was not an investigation of the allegations being made or an audit of

             the reasons for assurance and that I would not be compiling

             ongoing updates if any new information emerged and, if these

             others were wanted then proper consideration needed to be given

             as to how and from whom that would be commissioned as a

             separate properly resourced exercise.


      97.5   Challenge IT about the visibility and understanding of what was

             evidently a much longer list of issues than I had understood to be

             the case when compiling the report in 2010


98.   I do not recall how an audit and investigation would have panned out in

      detail, and I don't know how they are conducted today, but with the benefit

      of hindsight I would say that it is imperative that there is an environment

                                                                                 WI TN04630200




      and a culture whereby an SPM or other branch manager feels absolutely

      supported and knows what to do to raise an issue.


99.   Then, if a situation arises whereby the SPM feels that the Horizon

      accounting record is not accurate (presumably due to an actual transaction

      not having been recorded at all, not having been recorded properly,

      perhaps having been recorded in duplicate, being delayed or perhaps a

      feeling that a transaction which did not happen at all is actually featuring in

      the records) then I would suggest that between the SPM and a POL

      support team there needs to be a prompt and thorough analysis to pinpoint

      the following:


      99.1   The last date and the balances when the SPM was happy with the

             records â€” given that branches typically "cash up" each day, this

             could therefore become an almost real-time process


      99.2   The full list of transactions, remittances and other events recorded

             in Horizon since that date


      99.3   Exactly which of the transactions, remittances and other events in

             the list were felt by the SPM to have been recorded wrongly, or

             which such items had failed to be recorded


      99.4   This would then enable a prompt investigation and response to the

             concerns noted. This would be an improvement on the situation

             described by some SPMs where they felt that there had been a long

             period of no support and where everyone's memories would

             probably have been challenged by the prospect of proving what



                                Page 45 of 61
                                                                                 WI TNO4630200
                                                                               WI TN04630200




              exactly had happened over a long period of time.


       99.5   This would inevitably carry a significant resource cost and so it

              would be of additional priority that a baseline be reached whereby

              all colleagues across the network do feel confident in the processes

              applied to the point of sale system throughout its development,

              testing, upgrades and incident management. This is a large

              challenge and may require some sort of representative groups that

              all parties can have trust in.


100. Some SPMs have explained that they felt they had little or no training on

       the accounting aspects of running a post office, perhaps as opposed to

       other matters such as sales training which may have been part of their

       induction. It seems to me that it is imperative that SPMs should feel they

       receive adequate training and support in such matters and that either they

       then feel equally confident to train their own members of staff or that some

       other model of training is developed by POL to encompass SPMs own

       employees as opposed to just SPMs.


101.   There appears to have been no clear owner of Horizon and, although there

       were probably many people in support roles (eg. Contact centres) and in

       project roles (eg. For Horizon Online development) there does not appear

       to have been a sponsor or owner for the live system. Consequently,

       situations appear to have arisen where other individuals such as myself

       who had an understanding of certain discrete related processes such as

       product and branch accounting, were called on (or volunteered in the

       absence of others) to collate information about wider areas when a proper


                                  Page 46 of 61
                                                                                   WI TNO4630200
                                                                                 WI TN04630200




       system owner should have been in place and responding. There needs to

       be clear ownership and Board sponsorship in future. At the same time, it

       should be ensured that there is clear documentation, communication and

       ownership of any related policies and processes that relate to Horizon

       including matters such as training, support, maintenance, audit and

       investigation.


102. Bearing all the above in mind, I apologise for the misplaced confidence

       that I and others had in Horizon, for the seeming corporate naivety and the

       absence of clear ownership. I believe that the sad chain of events which

       panned out, with such awful impacts on subpostmasters, was a sad

       outcome from a variety of teams across the whole of POL having

       misplaced confidence in Horizon and taking assurance from the availability

       of a wide range of support processes without proper recognition of the

       complaints that were evidently being made about those processes. It was

       a failure of not listening, a failure of not working together and a failure of

       ownership in an organisation that simply had too many issues on too many

       fronts.


103.   The cash context may also merit reflection in the relationship between

       POL and SPMs. POL has had strategic ambitions at various times to be

       the banking hub for UK citizens and to be central to cash supply to the

       nation. There has indeed been much progress in those matters. It builds

       on the longstanding "cash equilibrium" which underpinned the operational

       model of the Post Office in the late 20th century wherein a large part of

       state benefits were paid out in cash in post offices and a large part of

       retailers' cash deposits were made into Girobank via post offices. As a
                                 Page 47 of 61
                                                                                       W ITNO4630200
                                                                                     WITNO4630200




          consequence, POL's business has been heavily cash focussed and that is

          in stark contrast to the situation in most other retail franchises where there

          may well be a requirement to manage cash and stock and there may be

          important compliance responsibilities, but there is unlikely to be the need

          to provide security for tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds of cash.

          That cash environment could, in a minority of cases be a temptation, but it

          can also be a stressful and potentially unexpected aspect of the job for

          someone whose main aspiration is the friendly service of their community.

          Somewhere, in the learnings from this Inquiry, that cash environment and

          the decisions around it need reflection.

   104.   Sadly, and probably due to the now ceased model of POL prosecutions,

          this whole situation has had and continues to have an adversarial context

          and needs to move to a collaborative context for the future success of the

          Post Office network and of the people that are that network.

   105.   1 also provided earlier reflections in my first witness statement.


   106.   There are no other matters that presently occur to me which I would like to

          draw to the attention of the Chair.
