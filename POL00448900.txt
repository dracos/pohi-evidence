Nick , Thank you for writing . It has
been ghastly but I have been buoyed
by over 150 emails of best wishes from
people I have worked with over the
years .

Thank you for drawing the Shah piece
to my attention . I have said to the
BBC/ ITV and any journalists that I will
not talk on or off the record . I will
depart quietly unless my hard won
reputation is put at risk .

The Sky journalist said his contact was
at UKGI and he let slip it was a“ she“ .
I wonder who that could be ?! The Sec
of State was v annoyed about that
leak .

Shah ‘ s comment of a bar room brawl
was not far off the mark . I told a few
CEOs / Chairs that I had never met

KB . They were incredulous .

Watch out for LG . She is always saying
you have been applying for jobs
without success . I kept saying you
need to watch your back - I forgot to
watch mine !

I very much enjoyed working with you
and wish you every success at PO and
after that .

Best wishes to you and Clair . Henry
