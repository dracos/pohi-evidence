Susan, this is the ToR I mentioned when we spoke yesterday. You will see that the intention is to approach it positively,
to see what lessons can be learned to help us manage the business in the future.

Richard, Alwen and I have just run through it this am and have noted the need to avoid scope creep. We flagged
potential pitfalls, especially around going back too far, or spending too long on cultural issues we are already aware of,
(acknowledging that Richard will need to explore some of this ground as context and I am keen to have his

observations). Richard is also very aware of not duplicating existing work.

He is keen to see you, Angela and Simon quite quickly, to set the frame of reference and Alwen will be in touch to set up
dates/give you contact details so you can.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Paula
