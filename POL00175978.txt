Jarnail,

As a result of the meeting that took place between Charles McLachlan and
Gareth Jenkins as directed by the judge, we now need to have:-

- access to the system in the Midlands where it appears there are live,
reproducible errors.

- access to the operations at Chesterfield to understand how
reconciliation and transaction corrections are dealt with.

- access to the system change requests, known error log and new release
documentation to understand what problems have had to be fixed.
