Penny Thomas telephoned me late yesterday and said that there expert, Gareth would compose a witness
statement dealing with Callender Sq as he would be a more able witness to be cross -examined then Anne.
Penny is unaware at this moment as to what the issue was with Callender Square but hopefully a statement
should be with me by the end of next week.

Yes, Anne is still employed by Fujitsu but unfortunately she will not be
available until Monday; I will make contact with her first thing and we
will be in touch.

Kind regards

My barrister telephoned me yesterday evening and requested that I found
POL00167129
POL00167129

out
any information that Fujitsu may hold in relation to an office called
Callender Square in Falkirk. Apparently, Anne Chambers a Systems
Specialist employed by Fujitsu was cross examined and it is said that
she

had full knowledge of an error in the Horizon system at this Post
Office.

If Anne is still an employee of fujitsu could you please give me her
direct

number so that I can contact her, or, alternatively, if there is any
report

or documentation as to what the error was can this be forwarded to me
asap.
