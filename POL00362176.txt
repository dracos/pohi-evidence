1, Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs

The Group's financial statements for the year ended 30 March 2014 were authorised for issue by the Board on 10 December 2014 and the
balance sheet was signed on behalf of the Directors (as at 30 March 2014) by Roger Lowe.

The Group's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union and as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 30 March 2014,

2. Accounting policies

Basis of preparation and accounting

The Group comprises Postal Services Holding Company Limited (the Company), which is wholly owned by HM Government, and its subsidiary
(together the Group). The Company is incorporated in the United Kingdom and the financial statements are produced in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006 (the Act) and applicable IFRSs. The UK is the Group's country of domicile.

The Group consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest £m except where otherwise
indicated. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historic cost basis, except for pension assets, derivative financial
instruments and available for sale financial assets, which have been measured at fair value.

Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertaking, The financial statements
of the major subsidiary are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting policies,

All intra-group balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full. Transfer
prices between business segments are set on a basis of charges reached through negotiation with the respective businesses.

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which
control is no longer held by the Group. Where the Group ceases to hold control of a subsidiary, the consolidated financial statements include the
results for the part of the reporting year during which the Group held control. These results are disclosed as a séparate line and are described as
discontinued operations. In line with the requirements of IFRS5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’, the comparative
information in the consolidated income statement and associated notes are restated, whilst the consolidated balance sheet is not restated,

Non-controlling interest represents the portion of profit/loss, gains/losses and net assets relating to subsidiary that are not attributable to
members of the Company. The non-controlling interest balance is presented within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from
parent shareholder's equity.

Going concern and funding

In making an assessment on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, the Directors have considered the going concern assessment
made by the Directors of the Post Office Limited subsidiary company. This is set out in detail below. After careful consideration of all available
information, the Directors are of the view that it is appropriate that the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern
basis.

The Post Office Group has net assets at 30 March 2014 and has operated at a profit before exceptional items during 2013-14 for the sixth year
Tuning. A funding agreement with Government was announced on 27 October 2010 which provided for:

Funding of £420 million for 2012-13

Funding of £415 million for 2013-14

Funding of £330 million for 2014-15

Extension of the existing working capital facility with the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills (BIS) of £1.15 billion up to 31
March 2016

State Aid approval for the funding for 2012-43 to 2014-15 was received on 28 March 2012 and it was also recognised that the working capital
facility was no longer deemed State Aid. £410 million was received on 2 April 2012 and £415 million was received on 2 April 2013.

2. Accounting policies (continued)

An additional funding agreement with Government was announced on 27 November 2013 which provided for:
* Funding of £280 million for 2015-16
* Funding of £220 million for 2016-17
* — Funding of £140 million for 2017-18
«Extension of the existing working capital facility with the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills (BIS) amended with a limit of
£950 million from 31 March 2015 up to 31 March 2018 .
State Aid approval for the funding for 2015-16 to 2017-18 has not yet been received.

This investment takes the form of a Government Grant, and enables the Post Office Group to modernise the branch network and the
continuation of the Network Subsidy Payment recognises the major social value that Post Offices provide to communities. New main and local
branches are currently being rolled out across the United Kingdom. Customers are beginning to benefit from a much better retail experience
including extended opening hours. This programme is designed to make the Post Office network more self-sustaining and, over time, less
dependant on direct subsidy. This will not involve a branch closure programme

The Directors are satisfied with the continued progress made towards modernisation during 2013-14 and that the plans in place and the
substantial investment secured will enable the Post Office Group to continue to modernise and to secure its future. However, they note that
the scale of change required remains significant so not without risk.

Changes in accounting policy and disclosures

The Group applies, for the first time, IAS 19 (Revised 2011) Employee Benefits. This has not required restatements of previous financial
statements as the effect of the application of IAS 19R is not material in the opinion of the Directors. IAS 19R includes a number of amendments
to the accounting for defined benefit plans, including actuarial gains and losses that are recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI) and
permanently excluded from profit and loss which is consistent with the existing policy of the Group; expected returns on plan assets that are no
longer recognised in profit or loss, instead, there is a requirement to recognise interest.on the net defined benefit asset in profit or loss,
calculated using the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit surplus. Other amendments include new disclosures, such as, quantitative
sensitivity disclosures.

In the case of the Group, the transition to IAS 19R and the difference in accounting for interest on plan assets and unvested past service costs

has not had a material impact on the net defined benefit plan surplus. The Group ‘has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or
amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. :

Accounting standards issued but not yet applied
The following new and revised accounting standards are relevant to the Group and are in issue but were not effective (and in some instances
have not yet been atiopted by the EU) at the balance sheet date:

periods.

Key sources of estimation, uncertainty and accounting judgements
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated based on historical
experience and other factors, In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. In addition the Group has to make
judgements in applying its accounting policies which affect the amounts recognised in the accounts. The most significant areas where judgements and
estimates are made are discussed below:

Pension assumptions

The costs, assets and liabilities of the pensions operated by the Group are determined using methods relying on actuarial estimates and assumptions.
These pension figures are particularly sensitive to changes in assumptions for discount rates, mortality and inflation rates. The Group exercises its
judgement in determining the assumptions to be adopted, after discussion with its Actuary. Details of the key assumptions are set out in note 24.

15
POL00362176
POL00362176

Postal Services Holding Company Limited
2. Accounting policies (continued)

Pension liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of
return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term. Judgement has been applied in determining that for these purposes a high
quality corporate bond constitutes AA rated or equivalent status bonds.

Provisions

The Group has recognised provisions where a present legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past event, where itis probable that an
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are detailed in note 23. Due
to the nature of provisions the future amount settled may be different from the amount that has been provided

Impairment of non-current assets :

The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-currents assets at each reporting date, Due to ongoing operational
losses (excluding the Network Subsidy Payment) in Post Office Limited the carrying value of intangible assets and property plant and equipment in Post
Office Limited other than freehold and long leasehold property has been impaired to the recoverable amount,

Investments in joint venture and associates

‘The Group's investments in its joint venture and associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method,
the investment is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of the net’ assets of the joint
venture/associates, less any impairment in value. The income statement reflects the Group's share of post tax profits from the joint venture/
associates.

Any goodwill arising on acquisition of an associate, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the Group's share of the net
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is included in the carrying amount and not amortised

Revenue
Revenue reported in the income statement is net of value added tax and comprises Turnover and the Network Subsidy Payment. Turnover
principally relates to the rendering of services as follows:

UK Parcels, International & Letters

- Account revenue is derived from specific contracts and recognised when the delivery of an item is complete. Prepaid revenue mainly relating to
stamp and meter income is recognised when the sale is made, adjusted to reflect a value of stamp and meter credits held but not used by the
customer,

General Logistics Systems
Revenue is derived from specific contracts and is recognised at the time of delivery.

Post Office Limited .
Revenue is recognised at the time that Government, financial, mails and telecoms services are provided.

The Network Subsidy Payment
Government grant revenue is recognised to match the related costs of providing the network of public post offices that the Secretary. of State for
Business, Innovation and Skills considers appropriate and which would otherwise not be provided,

Operating exceptional items

Operating exceptional items are items of income-and expenditure arising from the operations of the business which, due to the nature of the
events giving rise to them, require separate presentation on the face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of financial
performance in the year. in comparison to prior years.

Operating profit

Operating profit is the profit arising from the normal, recurring operations of the business and after charging operating exceptional items defined
above. It excludes the non-operating exceptional items for profit or loss on disposal of businesses and profit or loss on disposal of property, plant
and equipment. These items are not part of the normal recurring operations of the business but are material, so are presented separately on the
face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of financial performance in the year, in comparison to prior years.

Good
Business combinations on or after 29 March 2004 are accounted for under IFRS 3 Business Combinations using the purchase method. Any
excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities at the date of acquisition is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised.

After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment.losses. Goodwill arising from business combinations is reviewed for
impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired

16
POL00362176
POL00362176

Postal Services Holding Company Limited

2. Accounting policies (continued)

An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit)
exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset’s net realisable value and its value in use. For the purpose of such impairment
reviews, goodwill is allocated to the relevant cash generating units.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities is included in the cost of those entities and therefore not reported in the balance
sheet as goodwill.

Intangible assets .
Intangible-assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on
initial recognition, Intangible assets acquired separately or development costs that meet the criteria to be capitalised are initially recognised at cost
and are assessed to have either a finite or indefinite useful life. Those with a finite life are amortised over their useful life and those with an
indefinite life are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its
recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value in use.

Amortisation of intangible assets with finite lives is charged annually to the income statement on a straight-line basis as follows:

Customer listings 3 to 4 years
Software 1 to 6 years

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recognised at cost, including directly attributable costs in bringing the asset into working condition for its
intended use. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis by reference to net book value and to the
remaining useful economic tives of assets and their estimated residual values. The useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and
adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. The lives assigned to major categories of property, plant and equipment are:

Land and buildings:

Freehold land Not depreciated
Freehold buildings Up to 50 years
Leasehold buildings The shorter of the period of the lease, 50 years or the estimated remaining useful life
Plant and machinery 3-15 years
Motor vehicles and trailers. 2-12 years
Fixtures and equipment 2-15 years

Non-current assets held for sale

Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current
assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present
condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year
from the date of classification.

Disposal of Investments

When the group disposes of, or loses control, joint control or significant influence over a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, it derecognises the
assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the entity, the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest and any cumulative translation
differences recorded in equity. The fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any investment retained is recognised. The
resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.

Impairment reviews

Unless otherwise disclosed in these accounting policies, assets are reviewed for impairment if everits or changes in circumstances indicate that the"
carrying value may be impaired. The Group assesses at each reporting date whether such indications exist. Where appropriate, an impairment

loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit) exceeds its

recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value in use.

Leases

Finance leases, where substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item have passed to the Group, are capitalised
at the inception of the lease with a corresponding liability recognised for the fair value of the leased item or, if lower, at the present value of the
minimum lease payments, Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and capital element of the lease liability to achieve a
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated
useful life of the asset and the lease term.

v7
POL00362176
POL00362176

Postal Services Holding Company Limited

2. Accounting policies (continued)
Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are retained by the lessor, are classified as operating leases and
rentals are charged to the income statement over the lease term. The aggregate benefit of incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental
expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.

A leasehold land payment is an upfront payment to acquire a long-term leasehold interest in land. This payment is stated at cost and is amortised
on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. .

Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an‘ allowance for any non-collectable amounts. An estimate for
doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when identified.

Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are classified as; financial assets at fair value
through the income statement (held for trading); held to maturity investments, loans and receivables or available for sale financial assets as
appropriate, Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement or
financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

The Group determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each financial year
end. When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financi
instruments not at ‘fair value through the income statement’, any directly attributable transactional costs.

Loans and receivables
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and
have not been designated as either ‘fair value through the income statement’ or available for sale, are carried at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method if the time value of money is significant, Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and
receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process,

Available for sale financial assets

‘Available for sale financial assets’ are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the preceding
categories. After initial recognition, interest is taken to the income statement using the effective interest rate method and the assets are
measured at fair value with gains or losses being taken to the-consolidated statement of other comprehensive income until the investment is
derecognised, or until the investment is deemed to be impaired.

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an investment or a group of investments is impaired
Objective evidence would include a significant or protonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost. The determination of what is
‘significant’ or ‘prolonged’ requires judgement. In making this judgement the Group evaluates, among other factors, the duration or extent to
which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost.

Financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement (held for trading)
Derivatives liabilities are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments. They are carried in the balance sheet at
fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement.

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

All non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially
recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, less directly attributable issue costs. After initial recognition, non-derivative financial
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income
statement when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits (cash equivalents) with an original
maturity date of three months or less. In addition, the Group uses Money Market funds as a readily available source of cash, and these funds are
also categorised as cash equivalents. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash
equivalents as defined above, net of bank overdrafts. Cash equivalents are classified as loans and receivables financial instruments.

Financial assets - pension escrow investments
Financial assets - pension escrow investments comprise cash at bank, conventional gilt edged securities, index-linked gilt edged securities and
Treasury bills and money market fund investments.

Conventional gilt edged securities, index-linked gilt edged securities and Treasury bills are classified as available for sale financial instruments on
the basis that they are quoted investments that are not held for trading and may be disposed of prior to maturity.

18
POL00362176
POL00362176

Postal Services Holding Company Limited

2. Accounting policies (continued)

Financial assets - other investments.
Financial assets - other investments comprise short-term deposits (other investments) with Government, local government or banks with an
original maturity of three months or more. Short-term deposits are classified as loans and receivables financial instruments.

Financial liabilities - interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

Financial liabilities - obligations under finance leasés .
All obligations under. finance leases are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency contracts in order to manage the risk profile of any underlying risk exposure of
the Group, in line the Group's treasury management policies. Such derivative financial instruments are initially stated at fair value.

For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows, that is
either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction,

In relation to cash flow hedges to hedge the foreign exchange or commodity price risk of firm commitments that meet the conditions for hedge
accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to relate to an effective hedge is recognised directly in
‘equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.

When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, then at the time the asset or
liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the
acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability, For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity
are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net profit/loss, for example when the
hedged transaction actually occurs.

For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income

statement in the period.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge
accounting. At that point, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumuulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to
the income statement for the year.

Fair value measurement of financial instruments

The fair value of quoted investments (including conventional gilt edged securities, index-linked gilt edged securities and Treasury bills) is
determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date. Hence the conventional gilt edged securities, index-
linked gilt edged securities and Treasury bills are within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as defined within IFRS 7.

Where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. These include using recent arm's length market transactions;
reference to the current market value of another instrument which is substantially the same; and discounted cash flow analysis and pricing
models. Specifically, in the absence of quoted market prices, derivatives are valued by using quoted forward prices for the ‘underlying
commodity/currency and discounted using quoted interest rates (both as at the close of business on the balance sheet date). Hence derivative
assets and liabilities are within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as defined within IFRS 7.

For the purposes of disclosing the fair value of investments held at amortised cost in the balance sheet, in the absence of quoted market prices,
fair values are calculated by discounting the future cash flows of the financial instrument using quoted equivalent interest rates as at close of
business on the balance sheet date. .

Income tax and deferred tax
‘The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated
using raties that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date,

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised:for all taxable and deductible temporary differences and unused tax assets and losses
except:

© initial recognition of goodwill;
. the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction,
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit and loss:

the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future; and
© deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which they can be
utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and increased or reduced to the extent that it is probable that
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow them to be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the tax asset is realised or the
liability is settled, based on.tax rates (and tax laws) that have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, Deferred tax balances are not
discounted. Current and deferred tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity,
otherwise it is recognised in the income statement.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, itis probable that an outflow
of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation, If the effect of the time
value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax rate,

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits

The pension assets for the defined benefit plans are measured at fair value, Liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit
credit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term.
The resulting defined benefit asset or liability is presented separately on the face of the balance sheet. Full actuarial valuations are carried out at
intervals not normally exceeding three years as determined by the Trustees and, with appropriate updates and accounting adjustments at each
balance sheet date, form the basis of the deficit disclosed. All members of defined benefit schemes are contracted out of the earnings-related part
of the State pension scheme.

For defined benefit schemes, the amounts charged to operating profit are the current service costs and any gains and losses arising from
settlements, curtailments and past service costs. The net difference between the interest costs and the expected return on plan assets is
recognised as net pension interest in the income statement. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of
comprehensive income. Any deferred tax movement associated with the actuarial gains and losses is also recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income. :

For defined contribution plans, the Group's contributions are charged to operating profit within people costs in the period to which the
contributions relate. Overseas subsidiary make separate arrangements for the provision of pensions and other post-retirement benefits.

Contingent liabilities

Contingent liabilities are not disclosed if the possil jidered to be remote.

Foreign currencies
The functional and presentational currency of Postal Services Holding Company Limited is Sterling (£). The functional currency of the overseas
subsidiary in Europe is mainly the Euro (€).

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the-balance sheet date. The trading results of
foreign operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the reporting period, being a reasonable approximation to the actual
transaction rate, The exchange rate differences arising on the translation, since. the date of transition to IFRSs, are taken directly to the Foreign
Currency Translation Reserve in equity.

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling
at the balance sheet date. Currently hedge accounting is not claimed for any monetary assets and liabilities. All differences are therefore taken to
the income statement, except for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Group's net investment in a foreign
operation. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment occurs, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historic cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of
the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when
the fair value is determined.

Government grants

Government grants of a revenue nature are credited to the income statement and are shown separately to the expenditure to which they relate.
Government grants relating to assets are recognised as deferred income that is amortised over the useful life of the relevant assets.

3. Discontinued operations

During the year to 30 March 2014 the Group disposed of its subsidiary, Royal Mail plc (formerly Royal Mail Group Limited.) The steps detailing
this disposal are set out below.

‘Anew company Royal Mail Limited was incorporated on 6 September 2013 with share capital of 100 ordinary shares of £1.50 each (total £150)
issued to Royal Mail Holdings plc. Royal Mail Holdings plc was renamed Postal Services Holding Company plc on 12 September 2013, and Postal
Services Holding Company plc was renamed Postal Services Holding Company Limited on 12 December 2013. On 12 September 2013, the
special share in Royal Mail Group Limited, held by HM Government, was redeemed at par value of £1. Subsequently, also on 12 September 2013,
share capital of 999,999,900 ordinary shares of £1.50 each (total £1.499,999,850) was issued by Royal Mail Limited to Postal Services Holding
Company Limited in consideration for the transfer from Postal Services Holding Company Limited of the entire issued share capital of Royal Mail
Group Limited. Following this transfer, and therefore as at 12 September 2013, the issued share capital of Royal Mail Limited, which was all
issued to Postal Services Holding Company Limited, comprised 1,000,000,000 ordinary shares of £1.50 each (total £1,500,000,000),

On 17 September 2013, Royal Mail Limited approved a reduction of capital by way of solvency statement to cancel £1.49 from each issued
ordinary share of £1.50. This reduction of capital was registered on 18 September 2013, and reduced share capital from £1,500 milion to £10
million. Following this reduction, and therefore as at 18 September 2013, the issued share capital of Royal Mail Limited, which was all issued to
Postal Services Holding Company Limited, comprised 1,000,000,000 ordinary shares of £0.01 each (total £10,000,000). On 19 September 2013,
Royal Mail Limited was re-registered as Royal Mall plc. On 15 October 2013, Postal Services Holding Company Limited completed the successful
IPO of Royal Mail plc, selling 60.01% of its interest and 10% of its interest was granted free of charge to eligible Royal Mail plc employees, In the
financial statements of the Group this grant of shares has been accounted for in the Consolidated income statement and the Consolidated
statement of changes in equity. No further accounting will be required in the Group or Company financial statements in respect of the granted
shares as Royal Mail plc is the sponsoring employer. :

As a consequence of the above Group control of Royal Mail plc was lost on 15 October 2013, and the remaining interest of 29.99% is treated as an
investment thereafter. The remaining interest has been classified as an investment under IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and
measurement’ and not as an associate under IAS 28 ‘Investments in associates’, Under IAS 28 a shareholding should be accounted for as an
associate if the investee has significant influence, The standard states that the exercise of significant influence is evidenced through representation
on the board of directors, participation in policy-making processes, material transactions between the entities, interchange of managerial personnel
or provision of essential technical information.

Postal Services Holding Company Limited is not represented on the Royal Mail plc Board of Directors, at no point has it sought to participate in
Royal Mail plc policy making processes and there have been no material transactions between Postal Services Holding Company Limited and Royal

Mail plc since the date of the IPO. in addition there has been no interchange of managerial personnel or provision of essential technical information
between the companies. Therefore in the opinion of the Directors Postal Services Holding Company Limited does not have significant influence over
Royal Mail plc and consequently the remaining interest has been classified as an investment. For further detail in relation to the investment in Royat
Mail plc refer to note 20.

classification as a discontinued operation. For further detail refer to note 3.

The Group has unrecogniséd deferred tax assets of £144m (2013:£256m) comprising of £nit (2013:£nil) relating to retirement benefit
obligations, £99m (2013:£145m) relating to fixed asset and other timing differences, and £45m (2013:£14.1m) relating to tax losses. The Group
has capital losses carried forward the tax effect of which is Enil (2013:£4m) and temporary differences related to capital losses of Enil (2013:
£74m). The Group has rolled over capital gains of £3m (2013:£56m); no tax liability would be expected to crystallise should the assets into which
the gains have been rolled be sold at their residual value as it is anticipated that capital losses would arise.

Finance Act 2013 reduced the main rate of corporation tax to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 Aprit 2015. Deferred tax
balances have been measured to reflect these changes and reflect the expected timing of reversal

13. Pension escrow investments

The pension escrow investments were established to provide security to the Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP) Trustee in support of a 38 year
deficit recovery period as agreed with the Trustee in 2009 as part of the last triennial valuation.

As from 1 April 2012, following the transfer of almost all of the RMPP pension liabilities and pension assets to HM Government, all of the pension
escrow investments were made available to the Group. The investments were sold during the prior year. Pension escrow investments are

20. Financial assets and liabilities - summary and management of financial risk (continued)

Financial assets and liabilities — financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group's principal financial assets and liabilities comprise quoted investments, short-term deposits, money market liquidity investments, loans
and cash. The main purposes of these financial instruments are to raise finance and manage the liquidity needs of the business operations. The
Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from operations and are not
disclosed further in this section.

The Group enters into derivative transactions, which create derivative assets and liabilities; mainly commodity price swaps and forward currency
contracts, The purpose is to manage the commodity and currency risks arising from the Group's operations. It is, and has been throughout the
year under review, the Group's policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments is undertaken,

The main risks arising from the Group's financial assets and liabilities are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, commodity price
and credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.

Interest rate risk
The Group's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the Group's loans and borrowings and interest bearing financial
assets. The BIS loans to Post Office Limited of €nil (2013 £291m) are at short-dated fixed interest rates with average maturity 1 day (2013
average maturity 1 day). The total interest bearing financial liabilties/assets of the Group (excluding the non-current investments) of £34m (2013
£437m) are at short-dated fixed or variable interest rates.

The Group's policy is to manage its net interest expense using an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate financial instruments. No external
hedging of interest rate risk is undertaken,

Foreign currency risk .
During the year the Group was exposed to foreign currency risk due to; trading with overseas postal operators for carrying UK mail abroad and
delivering foreign origin mail in UKPIL; the balances held to operate the Bureau de Change services within Post Office Limited; and various
purchase contracts denominated in foreign currency, all in UKPIL. These risks are mitigated by hedging programmes. Hedging. is normally
confined to 90% of the forecast exposure where forecast cash flows are highly probable.

For the’ Bureau de Change business, balances of major currency holdings are hedged along with minor currencies showing a closely correlated
movement.

Commodity price risk
During the year the Group was exposed to fuel price risk arising from operating one of the largest vehicle fleets in Europe. In addition, the Group
was exposed to the commodity price risk of purchasing electricity and gas. Following the disposal of Royal Mail plc the Group has no material
exposure to commodity price risk.

Liquidity risk

The Group's primary objective is to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. This is
achieved by aligning short-term investments and borrowing facilities with forecast cash flows. Typical short-term investments include money
market funds, time deposits with approved counterparties, UK Government gilts and Treasury bills. Borrowing facilities are regularly reviewed to
ensure continuity of funding,

The unused facility for Post Office Limited of £1,150m expires in 2018 (2013 £859m expiring in 2016).

Capital management
The Group regards its capital as share capital, share premium, retained earnings and debt provided by the UK Government. The sole shareholder
and the provider of the majority of debt to the Group is the UK Government. The management of capital is closely linked to the Group's
relationship with its shareholder. The Group maintains its liquidity requirements by the management of its internal funds and by thé drawing
down of equity and debt from its shareholder as well as drawing on limited external debt facilities. The Group's debt to equity ratio is determined
by its shareholder.

Sensitivity
‘As a result of the mix of fixed and variable rate financial instruments and the currency and commodity hedge programmes in place, the Group has
no material exposure to operating profit risk from interest rate, exchange rate or commodity prices.

Carrying amounts and fair values

POL00362176
POL00362176

Trade receivables, payables, prepayments, accruals and client payables have been omitted from this analysis on the basis that carrying value is a
reasonable approximation for fair value, Pension scheme assets and liabilities are also excluded. Fair values have been calculated using current
market prices (published purchase price quotations/forward exchange rates/commodity prices) and discounted using appropriate discount. rates.
There are no material differences between the fair value (transaction price) of all financial instruments at initial recognition and the fair value
calculated using these valuation techniques, except in relation to the investment in Royal Mail plc, For all other financial instruments fair value is

equal to the carrying amount. The tables below also set out the carrying amount of the currency of the Group's financi

22. Hedging programmes

The purpose of the Group's hedging programmes is to mitigate volatility in foreign exchange rates. As explained in note 20, interest rate risk is
managed using an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate financial instruments. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk
Accounting rules require the Group to choose whether to designate effective cash flow hedge programmes or not (subject to various tests). The
impact of not designating a cash flow hedge programme is that all gains or losses on the derivatives in the programme have to be taken
immediately to the income statement and cannot be deferred into equity.

The Group had the following designated cash flow hedge programmes during the current and previous year: however these programmes were
disposed of with Royal Mail plc

Hedging Activities
i) The diesel fuel hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps in USS or Sterling and forward currency purchase contracts to
hedge the exposure arising from commodity price and USS/Sterling exchange rates for forecast diesel fuel purchases ¢

ii) The jet fuel hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps and forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising
from.commodity price and US$/Sterling exchange rates for forecast jet fuel usage.

iii) The air cofveyance hedge programme uses US$ forward currency purchase contracts. to hedge the exposure arising from US$/Sterling
exchange rates for forecast air conveyance purchases.

iv) Three capital programmes (one of which completed during the year) use Euro forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure
arising from Sterling/Euro exchange rates for contracted capital expenditure on automation projects.

v) The electricity hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps to hedge the exposure arising from electricity prices.
vi) The gas hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps to hedge the exposure arising from gas prices.

vii) The Group had undesignated cash flow hedge programmes for the Post Office Limited Bureau de Change balances, the UKPIL overseas
postal operator liabilities and the transactlonal exposure created by inter-company loans with GLS. The derivative balances of these
programmes are not material.

Commodity price hedging

Prior to the disposal of Royal Mail Group plc the Group entered into price swap contracts to lock future purchases (at an agreed volume) into a
known price, For diesel and jet these price swaps were sometimes entered into on the USS price for the commodity (based upon available market
prices), in which case the Group used forward foreign currency contracts to lock into a combined sterling price for the commodity

Following the disposal and as at 30 March 2014 the group did not operate a commodity price hedging programme.
Foreign currency hedging for non-commodity items

‘The exposure may be hedged with external forward foreign currency contracts, The foreign currency cash balances, the derivatives are all revalued
to current market prices at thie balance sheet dates, meaning that no net gains or losses arise in the income statement.

‘At any point in time, the derivative in these cash flow hedge programmes are either ‘in the monéy’ which mearis the hedged rates are better than
current market rates or ‘out of the money’ which means the hedged rates are worse than current market rates. The gains (‘in the money’) and.
losses (‘out of the money) as at the balance sheet date are deferred into equity (where the hedge is effective) and an associated financial asset or
financial liability is created in the balance.sheet. The financial asset/liability is released when the derivative matures. The amounts deferred into
equity are released when the hedged transaction occurs. The following table shows the derivative contracts entered into at 31 March 2013 and
the associated derivative assets and liabilities. There were no material derivative contracts entered into at 30 March 2014.

Other derivatives represent hedges by the Group of other foreign exchange and commodity price exposures, which are not designated under IAS
39 (including the hedge of the Bureau de Change currency holdings within Post Office Limited, the hedge of the trading balance with overseas
postal operators and the hedge of inter-company loans with overseas subsidiary)

There are timing differences between the maturity of the derivatives and the maturity of the underlying hedged transaction. Therefore there are
differences between the derivative balances in this note and the balance on the hedging reserve.

On 1 April 2022, almost all of the pension assets and liabilities of the Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP) were transferred to HM Government. On
this date the RMPP was also sectionalised with Royal Mail Group Limited and Post Office Limited responsible for their own sections. All
employees were transferred to be directly employed by Post Office Limited on the same date.

Prior to 1 April 2012, Royal Mail Group Limited had the legal relationship with the Trustees of both RMPP and RMSEPP and, as such, the
Trustees held Royal Mail Group liable for the actuarial deficit in the scheme. All employees were employed by Royal Mail Group Limited and
seconded to Post Office Limited under an agreement between Post Office Limited and Royal Mail Group Limited. Post Office Limited met the full
costs of employment and was responsible for the funding of the pension deficit attributable to these employees. Consequently Post Office Limited
recognised a balance sheet deficit based on employee numbers over 12 years and represented approximately 7% of the total balance sheet deficit
at that time, The nét pensions interest, deficit recovery payments and actuarial gains or losses were also allocated on this basis, giving the Post
Office Limited approximately 7% of the total balance sheet deficit at the balance sheet date. The current service cost, regular future service
contributions and curtailments were computed separately for Royal Mail Group Limited and Post Office Limited based on common factors/rates.

Royal Mail Group Limited is the principal employer in Royal Mail Senior Executive Pension Plan (RMSEPP) and Post Office Limited became a
Participating employer with effect from 1 April 2012. Post Office Limited, the Group's principal subsidiary, continues to account for approximately
7% of the RMSEPP scheme as it has done previously.

Financial year to 30 March 2014

The comparative disclosures in this note for the year ended 31 March 2013 reflect the full RMPP scheme (both the Royal Mail Group Limited and
Post Office Limited sections) and the full RMSEPP scheme. In the year to 30 March 2014, up to the date of disposal of Royal Mail plc the
disclosures continue to reflect both schemes in their entirety. Following the disposal, and as at 30 March 2014 the disclosures reflect the Post
Office Limited sectionalised RMPP scheme and the approximate 7% share of the RMSEPP scheme which was allocated to Post Office Limited as
described in the paragraph above.

During the year there was a consultation exercise with members of the defined benefit Royal Mail Pension Plan on proposed changes to the
terms. These changes were agreed and implemented on 15 October 2013. The key change was to the definition of pensionable’ pay which broadly
will increase in‘tine with RPI (capped at 5%) in future regardless of actual pay growth, The changes have resulted in a one-off continuing
operations exceptional gain of £102 million (note 6)

IAS 19R has been applied retrospectively from 26 March 2012. Expected returns on plan assets of defined benefit plans are not recognised in
profit or loss, Interest on net defined benefit surplus is recognised in profit or loss, calculated using the discount rate used to measure the net
perision surplus. The impact of transition to IAS 19R retrospectively is not material to the Group, and therefore no restatement has been required.

The disclosures in this note show how the value of the assets and liabilities have been calculated at the balance sheet date.
Defined Contribution

The charge in the income statement for the defined contribution schemes and the Group contributions to these schemes was £13 million, £2m of
which is due to continuing operations (2013 £18 million) during the year. A new defined contribution plan (RMDCP) was launched in April 2009.
New recruits joining from 31 March 2008 are able to begin paying contributions to the new plan after they have worked for the Group for a year.

Defined Benefit

Both RMPP and RMSEPP are funded by the payment of contributions to separate trustee administered funds. RMPP includes sections A, B and C
each with different terms and conditions:

* Section A is for members (or beneficiaries of members) who joined before 1 December1971;

* Section B is for members (or beneficiaries of members) who joined after 1 December 1971 and before 1 April 1987 or to members of Section A who
chose to receive Section B benefits;

‘© Section C is for members (or beneficiaries of members) who joined after 1 April 1987 and before 1 April 2008.
A series of changes to RMPP and RMSEPP began to take effect on 1 April 2008.

The changes encompassed:

* the Plans closed to new members from 31 March 2008;
* all pensions and benefits earned before 1 April 2008 are still linked to final salary at the time of retirement;
© from 1 April 2008, defined benefits building up for employee members of the Plan are earned on a career salary basi

employees can continue to take their pension on reaching 60 but the normal retirement age increased to 65 for benefits earned from 1 April 2010;,

* from 1 April 2010 it is possible to draw pension earned before the change to normal retirement age at 55, and continue working while still
contributing to the Pension Plan until the maximum level of benefits has been reached; and

* — RMSEPP was closed to future accruals on 31 December 2012.

Payment of £270 million, £21m of which is due to continuing operations (2013 £411 million) was made by the Group during the year in respect
of regular future service contributions, nearly all relating to RMP, The regular future service contributions for RMPP, expressed as a percentage
of pensionable pay, has remained at 17.1% (2013 17.1%), effective from April 2010. This rate is not expected to change materially during 2014-
15. For RMSEPP, these contributions have remained at 35.9% (2013 35.9%) until its closure.

The Group pays 7% of the total deficit payment required to fund the deficit in RMSEPP and a payment of £6 million, £m of which is due to
continuing operations (2013 £30 million including a special one-off payment of £20 million) was made by the Group during the year. No RMPP
deficit payments were made during 2012-13 or 2013-14, For RMSEPP, deficit recovery payments will be £1 million per annum, from 1 April
2010 to 31 January 2024. :

A current liability of Enil (2013 Enil) has been recognised for payments to the pension schemes relating to redundancy. During the year, payments
of £9 million, £1m of which is due to continuing operations (2013 £21 million) relating to redundancy were made. N

The weighted average duration of the RMPP fund is 28 years, and for the RMSEPP fund is 20 years. Over the next financial reporting period to
29 March 2015 it is expected that employer contributions to the plans will be £21 million and £1 million for RMPP and RMSEPP respectively.

The following disclosures relate to the gains/losses and surplus/deficit in the scheme recognised for RMPP and RMSEPP defined benefit plans in,
the financial statements of the Group:

a) Major long-term assumptions
The size of the RMPP pension surplus, which is large in the context of the Group and its finances, is materially sensitive to the assumptions
adopted, Small changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the surplus and overall income statement charge. The major
long-term assumptions in relation to both RMPP and RMSEPP were:

The ultimate cost of the RMPP plan to the Group will depend upon future events rather than the assumptions made. The assumptions made may
not be borne out in practice and as such the cost of the plan may be higher (or lower) than disclosed.

24. Employee benefits - pensions (continued)

In common with other defined benefit schemes, the main risk in relation to the arrangements is the value of the assets does not keep pace with
the increase in the value of the liabilities. This can arise for many reasons, but the most significant risks are as follows:

Investment risk: If the assets of the arrangements fall short of expectations, this will lead to a decrease in the funded status.

Asset volatility: The arrangements hold return seeking assets (including equities and property) which are expected to outperform corporate bonds
in the long term but give exposure to volatility and risk in the short term. RMPP does, however, invest in liability driven investment (LD!) assets

which mitigates the impact of interest rate and inflation volatility on the funded status.

Inflation risk: Higher inflation rates than expected will act to increase the plan liabilities as benefits will increase to a higher level than assumed

The arrangements have a maximum pension increase (generally 5% per annum) written into the rules which limits the increase for many benefits,
so limiting the impact of high inflation, This includes pensionable pay in RMPP, which was amended with effect from 1 April 2014. In addition,
the arrangement holds assets that increase in value as price inflation expectations rise, so mitigating the impact of rising inflation expectations.
These aséets include LOI assets in respect of RMPP.

Changes in bond yields: A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in
the value of the bond holdings and, to some extent, the LDI assets.

Pensioner longevity: If members live longer than expected, the liabilities would increase because pensions would be-paid for a longer time.

Liabilities accrued in the Royal Mail Pension Plan to 31 March 2012 were transferred to the Royal Mail Statutory Pension Scheme. These
liabilities are no longer an obligation of the Group and consequent the transfer resulted in a significant removal of pension risk from the Group.

The following table shows the potential impact on the RMPP assets and pension surplus of changes in key assumptions:

2014 2013
£m £m
Changes in RPI and CPI inflation of +0.1% pa (3) (4)
Changes in discount rate of +0.1%pa 3 4
Changes in real salary growth of +0.1% pa (a) (6)
Changes in CPI assumptions of +0.1% pa (a) (a)
‘An additional 1 year life expectancy (3) (4)

The sensitivity analysis has been prepared using projected benefit cashflows as at the latest full actuarial valuation of the plan. The same method
was applied as at the previous reporting date. The accuracy of this method is limited by the extent to which the profiles of the plan cashflows have
changed since those valuations although any change is not expected to be material in the context of the above sensitivity analysis,

Mortality

The mortality assumptions for the RMPP sectionalised scheme are based on the latest self administered pension scheme (SAPS) mortality tables
with appropriate scaling factors (106% for male pensioners and 101% for female pensioners). For future improvements the assumptions allow for
‘medium cohort’ projections with a 1.25% floor. These are detailed below:

Average expected life expectancy from age 60: 2014 2013

For a current 60 year old male RMPP member 26 years 26 years
For a current 60 year old female RMPP member 29 years 29 years
For a current 40 year old male RMPP member 29 years 29 years
