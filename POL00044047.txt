Office branch.

On Tuesday 11 December 2012 via e-mail I contacted the Branch and IT Systems Team of
Post Office Ltd requesting the Logs for Fazakerley Post Office branch of all calls made to the
National Business Support Centre (NBSC) for the period of January 2005 to January 2011.
I received the call log information as an attachment on the same day (11 December 2012)
via a return e mail.

If the attachment is printed the call logs would be printed on to 100 pages. I have examined
the call logs regarding the defence’s query regarding a call to NBSC concerning an alleged
Horizon problem in 2005,

I have identified a call made on 4 August 2005 made by Fazakerley Post Office branch

regarding a shortage of £592.21. There was a following up call on 11 August 2005 anda
