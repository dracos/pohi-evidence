1. ‘Introduction

This document is produced for ICL Pathway management. It is a summary of the
Business Integration Testing Regression Pass of the New Release 2 System. It
describes the test environment, test activities performed, test results and the
conclusions drawn.

There is a previous BIT Final Pass Report, which describes the results of the
previous test cycle.

Version: 1.0
Date: 06/04/99

Scope and Objectives

The principle objective of this Regression Cycle was to prove the Audit System was

acceptable, which had not been ready for the BIT Final Pass. It also provided a

vehicle to:

prove other areas that had not been proven during the Final Pass activity (such as
Invoicing)

¢ prove that many of the PinICLs raised during BIT Final Pass had been cleared

* run the BPS Acceptance scenarios again

The objectives of the BIT Test phase were:

e to prove data integrity across the various systems making up the NR2 solution
to prove that these systems integrate, and run together in a live like environment

.

© to provide an audit trail of the tests performed

© to demonstrate that the system meets the agreed User Acceptance Criteria,
particularly for BPS & Audit.

The scope of BIT is wide-ranging:
data is created at its source ...

e running the relevant desktop transactions for EPOSS, APS, CMS/PAS, OBCS

and BES
e BPS transactions via the 3 types of Helpdesk

e creating input files at the load area for CAPS & ESNS, and creating input files

on the remote FTMS Gateways for De La Rue Card Systems, De La Rue
Security Printing, Royal Mail and CFM

e loading the POCL and BA Reference Data in the same way as it will be done
live, e.g. using the RDDS & RDMC products

... and processing the data via the Maestro Batch Schedules, Harvesters, Bulk

Loaders through the TPS, CMS/PAS Extract, and Data Warehouse Systems

... and confirming the results by

e running and checking the Desktop Reports, Receipts, Cash Account,
PMSR/CBOS Reconciliation reports, the APR Reports, the CCS Invoice, the

CON system and a sample of performance measures via SLAM, FRMS reports,

BPS MIS Reports and Business Development Reports
e checking and reconciling the output files to CAPS, ESNS, TIP & HAPS

All of this is done on an Architecture that is as live like as possible, thus

testing the use of auto-config. counters, multiple Agents & Correspondence
Servers, Help Desks, Data Warehouse, MIS Clients, RDMC Workstation, etc.

3. Management Summary

The Audit system was much improved from the previous cycle, and the success
rates documented below should be acceptable. The A06 mapping was also aligned,
and the Invoice was successfully reconciled every day of the cycle. (These were the
two key issues from the BIT Final Pass Report).

All sessions where BES, EPOS, APS & OBCS were performed together were again
successful. (Additional scenarios had been added since the Final Pass, because
concems had been raised).

The BIT Regression Cycle Low Level Test Script comprised 8711 test steps, and a
subset of these were mapped to BPS & Audit acceptance criteria.

8168 of these test steps were successfully executed, with actual results matching
those expected. This is a success rate of 93.8%.

The 543 test steps that were unsuccessful were approximately, 40%
build/configuration issues, 50% product error, and 10% script/data or test execution
error. The product errors are all thought to be Low Business Impact.

110 PinICLs were raised as a result of this Regression Cycle.
53 of these were build/configuration issues, closed as duplicates or were no
fault in product.
57 of these were product errors of which 25 related to the audit system. Of
the remaining 32, 7 of these are on the KPR.

The BIT LLTS test steps are mapped against Acceptance Criteria for all products,
but this Regression Cycle was used as an Acceptance vehicle for BPS & Audit only.

2190 test steps were mapped against the BPS Acceptance Scenarios. 2130 of
these test steps were successfully executed, which is 97.5%.

13 new PinICLs were raised, and 42 outstanding PinICLs from previous
testing were encountered.

2524 test steps were Audit Tests, which included the script lines covering
the 34 Audit Acceptance scenarios. 2362 of these test steps were
successfully executed, which is 93.6%.

40 new PinICLs were raised, and 7 outstanding PinICLs from previous
testing were encountered. (25 of the new PinICLs and 3 of the outstanding
PinICLs came about as part of the execution of the 34 audit Acceptance
scenarios.)

ICL Pathway BIT Regression Test Report NR2 Ref: VI/REP/162
Version: 1.0
Date: 06/04/99

The BPS Acceptance Managers meetings held on Friday 12/03/99, Tuesday
16/02/99 and Wednesday 17/02/99 concluded that 142 out of the 160 BPS
Acceptance Criteria were successfully proven. An additional conclusion was that
the majority of the PinICLs that had caused BPS acceptance criteria to fail had now
already had fixes made for them.

The Audit Acceptance Managers meeting held on Wednesday 17/03/99, concluded
that 11 out of 16 Audit Acceptance Criteria were successfully proven. It was also
noted that the majority of problems that had caused Audit acceptance criteria to fail
were of a low business impact.

Test Conduct

Tests Performed

The testing was performed over the period from the 25" February to the 14" March
inclusive.

The following test script was run:

Script Number Description

BITO3 BIT Low Level Test Script

Test Execution

The LLTS was printed off on a daily basis, and the test runners initialed each step as
it was performed. Each step was marked as tick (successful), cross (unsuccessful) or
question mark (query). All unsuccessfuls and queries were subsequently
investigated. These were classified as product error, build/configuration issue,
script/date/test execution error, or no problem (mis-understanding). PinICLs were
raised for all product errors and build/configuration issues, (where there wasn’t
already an outstanding PinICL).

A Test Diary was kept during the cycle. This can be found in datahome/business
integration testing/acceptance pass 2/acceptance pass diary.

There were regular visits by the customer’s auditors during the test cycle.

Acceptance Criteria

A meeting needs to be held with the Audit Acceptance Manager to consider the
levels of success for the Audit Acceptance Criteria. Their assessments are
documented below. The table below is a summary of.

Of the 34 scenarios to be executed 4 (201,206,208,218) contained elements of R2+
functionality. These cases were therefore either totally excluded or partially
excluded from the testing performed.

Totals Amount
Successful (No incidents recorded against the 11
criteria although observations may have been

noted)

Unproven (Due to either application problems 0

stopping a case from performing further
planned actions, script or data errors certain
areas of the script could not be executed
leading to some criteria being unproven)
Unsuccessful (One or more incidents raised 5
against the criteria)

*Non audit-related application problems did prevent scenario 223 from being
executed fully but it was deemed that the omitted elements of the scenario did not
effect the overall proving of any of the acceptance criteria.

These are documented in Appendix B.
