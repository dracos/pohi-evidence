Dear Sirs,

Fourth Witness Statement of Mr Parsons

We write to record our surprise at the position taken in your third letter of 10 October 2017, in
relation to the late witness statement.

In summary, you hinted at the possibility of a witness statement about disclosure at an unspecified
time; you sought no direction for the filing of any evidence before the CMC (whether immediately
after Order No.1, or at all) nor any agreement about the same; and the statement raised
controversial matters 6 minutes after the deadline for exchanging and lodging Skeleton Arguments.

We note that your letter fails to answer the simple questions which we asked as to (i) when you
decided to file a witness statement and (ii) when work began on it.

You have been less than forthcoming about this witness statement and its timing has been
extremely unhelpful and disruptive.

We are not in a position not to respond to all the matters which you have raised for the first time as
to disclosure, but will endeavour to do so before the CMC. On other particular points, we will

respond on Monday.

Yours faithfully
