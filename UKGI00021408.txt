If not managed successfully the risks - including commercial, strategic and stakeholder risks and
those linked to management appointments and remuneration - have the potential to significantly
impact the financial sustainability of POL and its ability to achieve policy objectives (e.g. transformed
network, reduced HMG funding).

Reputational Risk Profile [Medium
There is significant political interest in the Post Office network and there are a number of clear policy
lobjectives. Risk is mainly centred on these areas, but it can also be linked to management and
remuneration issues. The UKGI POL team are aware of the pressures and are working
collaboratively with Post Office Limited to manage the risks away.
