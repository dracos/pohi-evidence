4.0 System Under Test

4.1 Environment

The majority of functional testing was performed on the main integration rig
BTCI. Security, Performance and System Management testing was performed
on the BTC3 rig - as was some counter end-of-year testing. The DITs were
performed on the E2E test rig, BTC7.

The main integration environment is made up of the following platforms:

Solaris Host running DWH, DRS, APS, TPS, OBCS, RDMC, RDDS, LFS, NPS
& TES (with EMC Disk array)

16 Correspondence Servers supporting Riposte messaging software in a dual
locale, four cluster configuration.

Web Servers - PAF & DVLA

ACDB Client. (residing on the SSC Workstation)
ACDB Server.

8 Generic Agent Servers.

1 NBX Routing Agent/Reversal Agent

4 Network Banking Agents.

DCSM Server.

DCSA Server.

Post Offices, which include varying configurations such as Single counter (fixed
SCO and mobile SCO), Double counter, Triple, and five counter position outlet.
English, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Ireland offices are included.

All Post Offices supporting Riposte messaging software.

FTMS gateways supporting file transfers to/from TIP, POCL RDMC, Horizon
Help Desk, sub-set of AP Clients, NS&I, DVLA & EDG.

Software

The software under test is defined in the system baseline documents lodged in
PVCS.

As is standard practice, each test cycle was begun with the software available
at that point and the test rig was regularly 'topped-up' with updates/fixes as
they became available.

Test Tools

Two new test tools were introduced at S80:

A track and trace emulator which emulated the Track and Trace Web Server
on the Post Office Enterprise Data Gateway (EDG). This allowed the T&T
XML messages to be parsed and automatically checked for conformance to the
AIS.

A counter transaction bulking and loading tool which was developed to support
the testing in relation to requirement BT001 (SU rollover timing). This tool
made it possible to load the five weeks of transactions needed to record the
time taken to rollover a stock unit at the end of a five week Trading Period.

5.2.1.1

5.2.1.2

After the end of cycle 3 the BTC] test rig was reset and a Peak clearance cycle
was begun. This had a number of objectives:

- to test fixes for all peaks outstanding at the end of cycle 3;
- to test fixes for peaks raised during end-to-end (E2E) testing;
- to test CP's delivered after the end of cycle 3 (3951, 3980, 3998 and 4002);

- to perform comprehensive regression testing of all areas for which peak
fixes had been taken or changes made as a result of the CP's;

- to perform the SU rollover timing test in support of Impact requirement
BTOOI.

The peak clearance cycle continued up until the cut-off for counter fixes at
S80.

Test Results
Overview by area

Impact - Migration

Given the complexity of the counter migration (with functional changes
triggered at three points: 20, 30 and 50) Migration testing went well from the
very first cycle and, by the third cycle, there were very few new problems found
in this area. The ability to migrate successfully - specifically to Branch Trading
at Point 50 - was a fundamental pre-requisite to the counter testing which
could only take place after migration had occurred (e.g. Transaction
Corrections, Branch Trading Statement, the handling of volume stock).

Host migration - specifically points 25, 30 and 40 - also was largely problem
free from an early point in our testing.

Impact - Balancing/Rollover

This was the area that caused most concern from the first cycle. In that first
cycle in particular, many problems were identified, e.g. cash and stock
disappearing, volume stock treated as value stock, incorrect figures on the
balance reports after stock adjustment and declaration, problems with local
suspense and the Trading Statement. The situation improved in Cycle 2 but it

was only in Cycle 3 that the code began to stabilise and testers were
consistently able to balance and rollover without error.

5.2.1.3. Impact - Other Reports/Counter Transactions

There were Impact related changes to a number of counter reports and, of
course, these were specifically tested. In addition, however, all counter reports
were tested in the course of a widespread and in depth regression test of the
counter as a whole. This included the testing of all transaction types
(NB/DCS/ETU/APS/Bureau/EPOSS) in all modes. There were very few
problems found in respect of either reports or transactions.

5.2.1.4 Impact - Variances

There were a number of problems with the Variance Report in the first cycle
but these were superseded by the removal of that report in response to CP
3990. Otherwise, the changes in this area - Add/Remove Cash, Variance check
and changes to the Cash declaration process - were largely problem free.

5.2.1.5 Impact - Transaction Corrections

This was a major new area of functionality at S80, with host and counter
components. There were few problems with the host (file loading and
processing) component but the counter component (the selection, processing
and reporting of Transaction Corrections) threw up a number of problems.
Amongst these were issues in relation to the rules for the use of Transaction
Corrections, specifically for currency and travellers cheques. By Cycle 3, the
issues had been resolved and the counter functionality stabilised.

5.2.1.6 Impact - POL MIS/CTS/FRTS

At S80 the feed of transactions to TIP is replaced by a feed to POL MIS with
additional data provided for bureau and on-line transactions. In the course of
testing a number of problems, with that additional data, were found. But the
problems were not serious (at least in terms of their impact on testing) and
were quickly fixed. The changes at S80 to the FRTS and CTS feeds were error-
free.

Company-in-Confidence Date: 03/08/2005

5.2.1.7 Impact - POL FS

POL FS testing was performed using reference data (product to article
mappings) prepared by the test team. There were some problems with this data
in early testing but these were quickly resolved. The testing itself went well -
there were no 'show-stoppers' but a substantial number of Peaks were raised in
the early cycles in particular.

5.2.1.8 Impact - HR SAP
There were very few problems with HR SAP.

.9 Impact - DRS / DW

The changes in these areas were relatively minor and the few problems found
were resolved by the start of Cycle 3.

5.2.1.10 RDMC/RDDS

RDMC/RDDS testing was initially delayed by resourcing issues: time had to be
spent on reference data preparation and management at the expense of specific
testing. The testing was completed successfully but only after a small number
of Peaks had been raised, fixed and retested.

5.2.1.11 Sales Prompts

The introduction of Sales Prompts was one of the major changes at S80 (along
with Impact and Track and Trace). In terms of the testing, however, it was the
least problematic, with only a small number of Peaks raised.

5.2.1.12 Track and Trace

There were a steady stream of Peaks raised during all three cycles of Track and
Trace testing. In the first two cycles of testing, Mails reference data prepared
by Development (in Crewe) was used. In the third Cycle (and subsequent Peak
clearance) Mails reference data provided by PO Ltd was used and this led to
the identification of problems not previously seen.

5.2.1.13 Non-functional - Performance

The Performance testing performed on the 20-counter office went well, with no
major problems reported. The SU rollover performance testing performed
subsequently, in relation to Impact requirement BT001, was also completed
successfully - it being demonstrated that the time taken to rollover a stock unit
post-Point 50 (i.e. with five weeks of data) was no more than five times the
time taken to roll over a stock unit at S75 (i.e. with one weeks data).

5.2.1.14 Non-functional - Other

The AKB, VPN and Estate Management changes were all virtually problem-
free. A number of problems, none of them very serious, were found during
Security testing. Similarly the testing of the new and modified FTMS interfaces
generated a relatively small number of Peaks.

the stack is taking longer than does session
transfer with non-Track and Trace items on the
stack. The length of time it takes has varied - on
some occasions it has been almost as quick (a
few seconds) as a session transfer with non-track
and trace items but on other occasions it has
taken as much as 3 and a half minutes.

(1) From Counter Roll-out (Point 20) until the end of the CAP when the
CBDB is switched off

(2) The last CAP until the first TP inclusive

(ii) However transfers with mails transactions appear to be taking
significantly longer at S80 compared with S75.

As T&T is only in pilot until post $90, it is likely that this problem will
not be an issue for the bulk of the estate.

Part (i) we can’t do anything about - it is believed to be only a problem
during S80 CAP to TP migration. So the recommendation is that we
publish a KEL.

Part(ii) is under investigation with Escher. Component showing
problem is Escher desktop, so a fix at $80 is unrealistic. If an Escher fix
is identified and can be supplied within the necessary timescales this
could potentially be included at S90.

S80D DCS : Can settle cheque by debit card

The Settlement menu was selected with nothing
on the stack (i.e. via the Functions menu).
‘Cheque’ was the selected and a value of £30
entered. This correctly showed on the stack as
‘Pay £30.00'. A Debit Card was inserted in the
Pin Pad and Chip and Pin selected. Since there
was no money owed by the customer the system
should not have allowed a debit card payment to
be made. Instead the amount display showed
session total -30.00, max amount 30.00, default
amount 0.00 and a DC transaction for £30.00
was completed. The stack now showed that the
customer was to be paid £60.

This is an unlikely scenario and not a new problem at $80. It is only a
problem if the Settlement menu is on display with nothing on the stack —
under normal circumstances where a cheque is used in part payment
against, say, a TV licence, then the max and default amounts for the
Debit card payment are calculated correctly.

However, in automated testing in which the test scenario was repeated

8.0 Conclusion

8.1 Summary

S80 has been one of the most complex Horizon releases to date. The changes at the counter -
for Track and Trace and Sales Prompts but most particularly for Impact - have been
fundamental and wide reaching. The Data Centre also has seen significant change, specifically
to the TPS host system (again, Impact related). The complexity of the release has been further
increased by the fact that the S80 changes are triggered at various migration points.

It has not been an easy release to test. But the SV&I team have worked extremely well and
helped deliver a working, robust system which meets the requirements.

We have needed and received considerable support from the Design and Development teams
and they deserve much credit and our thanks for that. Development consistently provided us
with a quick turnaround on Peak fixes and the PIT and SPTS teams were kept busy processing
and applying those fixes. They typically did this without any delay and they, also, deserve
credit and thanks for their support.

Finally, we must also thank our colleagues in the Post Office End-to-End test team. They
always make a very valuable contribution and this has been particularly true of this release.

8.2 Issues

8.2.1 Changing requirements/design

As happens with all releases, requirements changed/were added during the testing. For S80,
however, the level of change certainly appeared that much greater than in previous releases -
and occurred later (the last S80 CP - 4002 - was not authorised until after the end of cycle 3).

The design also evolved and changed during the course of testing, partly as a result of changed
requirements and partly in response to problems identified during testing.

This was particularly true of critical areas like the handling of local suspense, the derivation of
fields on the Branch Trading statement and the reporting of Travellers Cheques.

8.2.2 Some areas not tested before SV&I.

For some areas of change - notably Transaction Corrections and those introduced by the late
CP's - there was no DeLT testing in advance of SV&I testing. Not surprisingly, there were
instances in which the untested code did not perform even its most basic function(s) when

applied to the SV&I environment. In those instances, the time spent by PIT/SPTS in
packaging and applying the code was effectively wasted.

8.2.3 Steep learning curve for many of the test team.

Most of the S80 test team only joined the team after the HLTP had been produced (because
they were working on S75). They missed out on the main S80 analysis and, as a result, had a
steep learning curve. They were then required to write the low level test script from a high
level test plan (functions and conditions) prepared by another tester. This was necessary in the
circumstances and did not compromise the testing but the low level scripts took longer to
prepare and were not as detailed as would typically have been the case had the same person
been responsible for both.

8.2.4 I Complex low-level changes.

Typically, in order to test a system, we need to know what it is supposed to do, not how it
does it. However, the nature and complexity of some of the changes at S80 (for example those
in relation to Data Server and soft launch) were such that they could only be fully tested if the
different processing paths and the conditions under which they were followed, were
understood. While it made testing more difficult, there was a positive aspect in that we
probably worked closer with Design on this release than ever before.

8.2.5 Reference Data

At S80 there was a very considerable amount of test reference data to be prepared, including:
- an update to every stock item

- POL FS mappings

- HR SAP mappings and schedules.

- Sales Prompts

- Mails reference data

Technically it should not matter who prepares the reference data: providing the data is defined
in accordance with the AIS (in all its permutations) then the system should support it and
behave accordingly.

But it is desirable if we can use the test reference data prepared by the Post Office (providing
that data reflects the conditions which our analysis has shown need to be tested). The
advantages are obvious:

= Test reference data preparation can be time-consuming and requires considerable
experience - limited in our team - and attention to detail.

= The data prepared by PO Ltd to support their E2E testing can be expected to be more ‘live-
like' than data we prepare ourselves - important since there is always a risk that we miss a
permutation which, when used, results in the system behaving invalidly.

= There is an advantage for the Post Office in that if we use their data before they do then
errors in the data can be identified and fixed before E2E testing begins.

= It is easier to manage test rigs if, in the main, only one set of test reference data is used
across all of the rigs.

The problem, of course, is that typically our testing begins before the PO Ltd data is ready.
This was certainly the case at S80 - with the exception of Mails reference data, PO Ltd test
reference data was not available until after Cycle 3 had started. Also, if we use PO Ltd
reference data we don't have control of it and risk being affected by problems/delays in
preparing the data. Finally, there are always some specific reference data variations which we
need which will not be reflected in PO Ltd data.

So, the SV&I team had a lot of test reference data to prepare and manage at S80 and,
although the team now has two people experienced in reference data preparation, the
workload was such that they were stretched. One consequence was that specific
RDMC/RDDS testing planned for S80 (and performed by one of the two) was delayed and
was not fully completed until the Peak Clearance cycle.

I would note that although we used test reference data prepared by SV&I in cycles 1 to 3, we
used at least some of the data - the item updates for Impact - prepared by PO Ltd for the Peak
Clearance cycle. This brought its own problems: there were errors in the data (although these
were quickly cleared) and it was necessary to separate the PO Ltd data we were using from
the data we were not (i.e. the POL FS and HR SAP mappings).

Mails reference data deserves special mention. Mails reference data is not prepared by SV&I
(we do not have the know-how/tools). Nor do we define tests which cover all permutations.
We expect the Mails reference data to be defined to support the stated requirements/design
and write our tests accordingly. If the data is not available from PO Ltd then it must be
prepared by the Mails Development team in Crewe. This was the case at S80. For cycles I and
2 we used Mails reference data prepared by Crewe and in Cycle 3 we used Mails reference
data prepared by PO Ltd. The Cycle I and 2 testing was still valid (the Crewe reference data
supported most of the tests) but it would have been better to have had the PO Ltd reference
data from the start.

8.2.6 Stock Unit Rollover testing

The testing in relation to Impact requirement BTO01 was only begun towards the end of the
Peak clearance cycle. BT001 states:

Production of a balance report for a stock unit must be possible to be produced within 5
times the current production time for a stock unit with a busy transaction profile, long
trading statement period

There were various reasons for the delay in starting this testing, not least the fact that a new
bulk loading tool had to be developed to inject five weeks worth of transactions into a counter
message store. It must be accepted however that the issue did not receive attention as early in
S80 testing as it should have done. As it happens, the testing was completed successfully and
the requirement was met.

8.3. Test procedure improvements for future releases.

The desired improvements are self-evident from the issues listed above and they go beyond
improvements in test procedures:

= Clear unambiguous requirements, covering all aspects of the changes and available as early
in the testing process as possible. Change is inevitable as the design evolves but the test
team need to be better kept informed of the planned changes (rather than having to await
the reissue of Conceptual Designs / Design Proposals).

= As has already been noted, there was particularly good working relationship between the
test team and design at S80. This was important because it has not been - will not be -
possible for the test team to do their job without understanding the design at a low level.
The relationship between SV&I and Design needs to be maintained and formalised, with
the test team actively involved in design reviews and, again, kept informed of planned
changes to design.

= The decision to have some low-level S80 scripts written by someone other than the analyst
who wrote the HLTP was made from practical necessity - it is not SV&I standard practice
so no change to procedure is required to address the issue. At S90 those responsible for
test analysis are also responsible for the production of the low-level tests scripts, thus
avoiding the 'steep learning curve' issue at S80.

= It is recommended that no major change is accepted by SV&I until that change has passed
basic, at least, link testing (Delt).

= With the exception of Mails reference data, SV&I testing must not be dependent on the
availability of Post Office test reference data. The SV&I test reference data requirements
should be identified at the earliest possible moment in the test analysis phase and

preparation (and test loading) of that data begun as far in advance as possible of its first
usage. The extent of the work involved in reference data preparation/management must be
better understood and properly resourced. One additional person should be trained in, and
subsequently involved in, reference data preparation. If PO Ltd test reference data is
available and can be used seamlessly then it should be used. It is most desirable that Mails
reference data, in particular, is made available by the PO Ltd before Mails related testing is
begun. However, SV&I team members responsible for Mails related testing must develop
an understanding of Mails reference data (for which they will probably require some
training) to the extent that they can, at least, specify data for preparation by Crewe.

= S80 demonstrated our weakness in respect of performance testing (especially after our
main performance tester left the company). The required performance testing was
completed but we clearly need someone to take responsibility for future performance
related testing and that person (or persons) needs the appropriate guidance, from Test
Design, on the requirements (what performance is being measured against what
benchmark) and needs the technical skills to run the tests.
