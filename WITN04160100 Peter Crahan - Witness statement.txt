POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF PETER EARNEST CRAHAN

|, Mr Peter Ernest Crahan, will say as follows:

1. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
(the “Inquiry”) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 8 August

2022 (the “Request’).

2. My professional background is that | joined the Civil Service in 1975 and moved
to the Information Technology sector in DSS/DWP in 1976 (DSS IT). Prior to
joining BA/POCL (The Programme), | was employed in middle and senior
management positions in DSS IT for 20 years. | became a Senior Civil Servant

in January 1994.

3. My DSS IT experience covered the full lifecycle of system development,
countrywide operation and support, and contract and programme management.

This experience was gained in a variety of roles covering specific projects or

Page 1 of 18
WITNO04160100
WITNO04160100

ongoing support of Live operations. For example, | was the manager for the
development and enhancement of products to enable effective support of the
DWP/DSS Live IT systems such as the Change Management System and the
Incident and Problem Management System. Additionally, | was the DSS
Service Delivery Director with 2400 personnel supporting and operating the

largest civilian computer resource in Europe.

. Prior to joining the Programme, | was undertaking a DSS Headquarters role to
establish a small team to co-ordinate and monitor activity around a change

programme inspired by the Secretary of State.

. With the Change Programme Team established and the BA/POCL moving from
the procurement and contract award phases to programme delivery, | was
recruited by BA/POCL directors to replace the then Director of the Programme
Delivery Authority (PDA) for the BA/POCL Programme; this led me to become
involved in the Horizon Project. | took up the role as Director of the PDA in July
1996. | left the PDA in April 1998 and became the BA Caps Business Director
at that time, focusing on BA specific activity on Caps and the Programme. | left

the Caps Project in late January 1999 for an alternative role in DWP IT.

. | have been asked to describe and explain the objectives of DSS in procuring
the Benefits Payment Card (“BPC”). The DSS had for many years used a
number of methods to pay claimants, but the vast majority were paper based
with instruments of payments (principally order books and giros) cashed within

Post Offices. This method had proved to be prone to significant fraudulent

Page 2 of 18
WITNO04160100
WITNO04160100

abuse.

7. The overall objective of DSS was to provide a virtually fraud-free automated
method of paying benefits at Post Offices. This automated system would have
lower end-to-end costs than the paper-based system, reduced administration

costs and enhanced accounting arrangements.

8. The overall purpose of the PDA was to act as a focal and co-ordinating point
for both BA and POCL to provide oversight of the Programme, and to plan,
monitor and report progress to the PDA Board and BA/POCL Project Steering
Committee. The PDA was also the key means of providing a business, technical

and contractual interface to ICL Pathway.

9. The PDA functions and structure were as follows:

a. Contract management, maintenance, and oversight.

b. A project management office to produce and maintain plans, produce

reports for steering groups, and maintain risk and issues registers.

c. A system design and security group to complete issues covered by

agreements to agree.

d. A testing group for the systems delivered from Pathway and associated

CAPS (BA Customer Accounting and Payment System) interfaces.

e. An implementation group to plan delivery, training and physical

implementation within the POCL estate of some 19,000 outlets.

f. Implementation of maintenance releases of the Programme and ongoing

Page 3 of 18
WITNO04160100
WITNO04160100

monitoring of the service from the Initial Go-Live (IGL) and operational

management teams.

g. Acommunication team and a finance team.

10.All of the functions of the PDA and all aspects of the Programme were overseen
by the PDA Board as the first level of governance. The PDA Board had director
level representation from BA/POCL and an independent chair from the Northern
Ireland Social Security Agency. The ICL Pathway Managing Director attended

for Pathway specific agenda items only.

11. The second and senior level of governance was the Project Steering Committee
(PSC) with senior level representation from BA/POCL and ICL (ICL Chief
Executive, Managing Director of ICL Pathway, Chief Executive of Benefits
Agency and Managing Director of POCL). Overall strategic direction and control

of the Programme was the main remit of the PSC.

12. The nature of my role was Programme Management related. Whilst | have high
level technical awareness, | am not a technician. Consequently, in subsequent

sections, | do not feel capable of addressing detailed technical questions.

13. My role as a Programme Director of the PDA was to provide full time oversight
and direction of a mixed team of BA and POCL personnel supported by external
consultants. | had dual reporting lines to the POCL Finance Director and BA

Caps and Card Director.

Page 4 of 18
WITNO04160100
WITNO04160100

14.As Director and Chair of the PDA, | held weekly PDA Management team
meetings to review progress against plans, highlight issues and risks, and
agree forward priorities with the subject experts. Issues which could not be
resolved, or contingency positions agreed, were escalated as necessary to

POCL or BA directors, Pathway senior manager or the PDA Board.

15.| have been asked to describe the nature of my relationship with the two project
sponsors; POCL and BA. One of the core aspects of my relationships with the
sponsors was to demonstrate independence from both BA and POCL and to

concentrate my efforts on the overall Programme objectives.

16.1 attempted to achieve this by recognising the respective objectives of the
sponsors and forging effective working relationships with the PDA team from
both BA and POCL. | also had formal and informal discussions with director

level colleagues in both sponsor organisations to cement understanding.

17.Whilst already familiar with the overall DSS, | undertook a number of induction

and familiarisation sessions within POCL and the wider Post Office estate.

18. The PDA was abolished in April 1998 and | agreed with both BA and POCL that
| would not head the subsequent replacement Horizon Team in POCL. |

became Caps Business Director within BA at that time.

19.1 subsequently worked with BA and POCL colleagues to manage the transition

Page 5 of 18
WITNO04160100
WITNO04160100

of PDA functions to respective teams in BA or POCL and, against the backdrop
of Programme uncertainty and doubts over the future of the benefit payment

card components, the relationship with POCL became more strained.

20.Having returned to the core DWP/BA Team within Caps, | was now focussed
on the BA objectives with less need to give due consideration to POCL
objectives, with no requirement to demonstrate independence, hence the

relationships with POCL became more strained.

.| have been asked to provide detail about the initial go live pilot scheme, its
function and any technical issues that were identified, Following sign off from
the PDA Board, the IGL release of the Pathway System and associated CAPS
interfaces to pay Child Benefit only was successfully implemented in one Post
Office in Stroud in September 1996. This required input from all parties
including PDA, Caps, POCL, Pathway and appropriate sub-postmasters for
training, implementation and system delivery, but was coordinated and
controlled by the PGA IGL team. The service was extended to ten Post Offices

in November 1996.

22. Certain security features were not contained in this initial release (e.g., the need
to bar access to Windows) but with the limited exposure and being used for
Child Benefit only, the risks were deemed acceptable for use within one Post
Office. | believe these issues were addressed and tested successfully prior to
implementation of the system (Release 0.2) in a further 9 Post Offices in

November 1996. Further functionality was delivered by Release 1c enabling

Page 6 of 18
WITNO04160100
WITNO04160100

implementation of the IGL system to some 200 Post Offices by November 1997.

23.1 have been asked to describe the problems faced by the Horizon project
between Autumn 1996 and Spring 1997 and to explain the reasons for the ‘no
fault’ re-plan. The Programme continued to develop during the second half of
1996, and all parties had a greater recognition of the scope and scale of the
challenges they faced with the project and the need for additional resources
and time required before being able to achieve a Live Trial of the end-to-end
service which had been planned for early 1997. It was agreed that the Live Trial
planned for early 1997 carried too much risk as the timescales were tight and
the success of the Live Trial was dependant on the appropriate releases from

Pathway and Caps going to plan so a replanning exercise was undertaken.

24.This recognition led to the agreement to a ‘no fault’ re-plan with revised dates
for the Live Trial agreed for later in 1997. All parties agreed to absorb their own

additional costs.

25.In addition, | have been asked to explain the problems faced by the Horizon
project between April and December 1997. Following the ‘no fault’ re-plan, the
Pathway IGL system continued to operate at a satisfactory level, but overall
development of the system continued to slip with Pathway unable to deliver a

Live Trial in 300 Post Offices by the agreed re-plan date in November 1997.

26. What led to all the parties agreeing to an independent review by PA Consulting

in July 1997 was the uncertainty around future release dates, ongoing slippage

Page 7 of 18
WITNO04160100
WITNO04160100

of delivery dates on the Programme and the need to ensure that any lessons
learnt were factored into future plans. The findings required action from BA and
POCL but raised particular concerns about Pathway’s ability to deliver a robust
solution in acceptable timescales. The recommended actions were accepted

by all parties.

27.The PA Consulting review highlighted the resourcing issues facing the sponsors
and Pathway to deliver this “world class” programme. The review identified that
the plans for national rollout, having slipped by over 12 months in 12 months,
required attention in a number of key resource areas. For BA, the need to
strengthen the Caps Programme Management Office. For POCL, to ensure that
suitably qualified resources were recruited to enable effective Service
Management on transfer from the PDA and to develop an implementation
strategy for national rollout. For Pathway, to undertake a competency

assessment on all key resources and rectify any weaknesses identified.

28.At this stage (November 1997), both the BA Caps and Cards Director and the
POCL Finance Director approved the issue of a legal notice of breach of
contract to ICL Pathway. The main reasons would seem to have been the
failure to achieve a Live Trial, leading to further erosion of the BA Business
Case and legitimate concerns over the BA Chief executive’s position as
accounting officer within DSS for the Programme. This action was also taken
to preserve rights and remedies under the contract including the right of

termination.

29.1 have been asked to describe the technical issues identified during the
development and testing of Horizon at this time however, | find great difficulty
in providing any detailed assessment of technical issues for a number of key
reasons. Whilst | had undertaken a number of technical roles in the early part
of my career in DWP IT | had, for several years in advance of my time on the
Programme, migrated to Project and Programme management roles with no
requirement for understanding low level technical detail. Additionally, all events
surrounding my time on the Programme are historical in nature and | cannot
recall the technical position to a sufficient level of detail. The documents also
do not have the level of detail necessary for me to assist with a comprehensive

analysis. As a result, | am unable to fully answer question of a technical nature.

30.1 note from the documents that there had been drift of the solution offered;
Pathway had declared their inability to deliver Full Extended Verification
Procedures which were key for the BA in Release 2 Exhibit WITN0416-01/1).
Similarly, Pathway were proposing to descope Security requirements for
Release 1c and incorporate those in a later release (Exhibit WITN0416-01/2).
There is mention of a future change proposal following the Operational Service
Management report in December 1997 reporting 46 lost transactions, 8 of which
were duplicate payments. | have no recollection whether this was incorporated
in Release 1c or proposed for Release 2 (Exhibit WITN0416-01/3). A
structured approach to testing was being taken for all significant releases. The
phases included Security testing, Integration testing, Model Office rehearsal
and Model Office test. In my opinion, following this structured approach gave a

good degree of assurance on the fitness for purpose of a Pathway release.

WITNO04160100
WITNO04160100

31. The main problems faced by the Programme prior to 1998 have been explained
above. Between January and May 1998, the main focus of the Programme was
to provide support to the Release 1c system operational in 200 Post Offices,
continue to test Release 2 components and to continue with work across the

Programme to agree dates for Release 2 delivery, testing and a Live trial.

32.By early 1998 | was aware that the BA were seeking to maintain their
termination rights under the contract following issue of the breach notice to
Pathway in November 1997. This led to a "cure notice” being issued to Pathway
by the BA only in May 1998. My understanding is that this cure notice expired
some 13 weeks later at which time the BA Chief Executive had to obtain

Ministerial instruction to proceed with the Programme.

33.Prior to this period, formal contractual decisions had been agreed between BA
and POCL (‘no fault re-plan in February 1997 and issue of breach notice to
Pathway in November 1997’). This position changed with the BA only decision
to issue the cure notice to Pathway in May 1998 and hence preserve
termination rights. As mentioned above, with the expiry of the cure notice period
in August 1998 the BA Chief Executive was instructed by the Secretary of State
for Social Security not to exercise his termination rights but to await the

outcome of Government wide discussions on a way forward for the Programme.

34.As confirmed in my earlier responses, | do not feel qualified to answer questions

relating to the technical issues identified during this period nor what the reasons

Page 10 of 18
WITNO04160100
WITNO04160100

are for suspension of the data integrity testing of Horizon. This is further
supported by the fact that my role as PDA Director ceased in April 1998 with
functions being transferred to POCL or BA. Responsibility for Data Integrity
testing and all sponsor aspects of EPOSS had been migrated to the Horizon

team in POCL.

35.1 have also been asked to describe the problems faced by the Horizon project
between June and December 1998. At this time, the Horizon Project Team in
POCL had assumed responsibility for ongoing oversight of the Programme with
standard progress reports being produced for the Caps Project Board in BA
(Exhibit WITN0416-01/4). The Programme continued to support the existing
Release 1c system and to undertake structured testing of Release 2. Issues
arose such as the approach to Model Office Testing covered below and the
Programme continued to slip. However, in my opinion, the main issue impacting
the Programme was resolution of the discussions and negotiations occurring
throughout this period across Government and with input from BA, POCL and
Pathway, to review the range of options available for the future of the

Programme.

36.As covered earlier, | do not feel qualified or able to answer questions relating
to the technical issues in any detail and | do not wish to provide incorrect
information to the inquiry. However, it is apparent from examining the
documents that Lost Transactions continued to be an issue and were
considered by Pathway and POCL to be the top priority for rectification in the

Live system. | am unsure if this was ever resolved prior to cancellation of the

Page 11 of 18
WITNO04160100
WITNO04160100

Benefit Payment card contract (Exhibit 0416-01/5).

37.Clearly, in constructing the plans for Pathway release 2, the sponsors had
differences of opinion on a number of topics prior to reaching agreement. One
significant example was the approach to be taken for Model Office testing of
Pathway Release 2. The BA believed the Pathway assumptions on duration
were unduly optimistic, based on their experiences of release 1c testing, and
wanted to see Model Office plans extended. This would have given an
estimated Live Trial start date of May 1999. This was unacceptable to POCL
who proposed a two-stage approach to Model Office testing with phase 1
focused on Child Benefit only. This would be followed by a Phase 2 Model
Office covering multi benefits. This would have given an estimated Live Trial
start date on Strand 1 of February 1999. It was this two-phase approach which
was subsequently reflected in plans. (Exhibit WITN0416-01/6 and Exhibit

WITN0416-01/4).

38.1 have been asked to describe ICL Pathway’s proposed changes to the
acceptance criteria for the Horizon system in November and December 1998.
Work to develop the acceptance specifications was progressing at a steady
rate. By January 1999 3 of the 24 specifications had still to be agreed but these
were not considered to be prejudicial. However, there were differences of
opinion between Pathway and the sponsors about the stage of testing to have
been completed prior to acceptance being achieved with the consequent loss

of the sponsors’ termination rights.

Page 12 of 18
WITNO04160100
WITNO04160100

39.In November 1998, Pathway were proposing an acceptance approach which
would see the Benefits Agency losing their termination rights prior to the start
of the Live Trial. The BA position was that the service had to be tested in live
operation before acceptance and loss of termination rights. The agreed position
would need to reflect the two phase approach to Model Office testing and the

implications on termination rights.

40.1 cannot recall if overall agreement on this issue was reached between BA.

POCL and Pathway.

41.1 have been asked to describe the problems faced by the Horizon project in the
early part of 1999. During the early part of 1999, the Programme continued to
support Pathway Release 1c in Live operation and the structured testing of
Pathway Release 2. The main issue remained as agreeing a forward plan which

could be endorsed by all parties.

42. The latest planned start date for Model Office testing of Pathway Release 2 had
been set as 14 December 1998 but this had been missed by Pathway.
Replanning discussions were continuing and it became clear that
Horizon/POCL had a differing planning emphasis from the BA. POCL wished
to move towards the earliest date for rollout whereas the BA required a stable
plan for multi benefit operation to safeguard claimants (WITN 0416-01/7). | have
no recollection of whether a final plan was produced and agreed prior to

cancellation of the Benefit payment card contract.

Page 13 of 18
WITNO04160100
WITNO04160100

43.As outlined earlier in the statement, | do not feel qualified or capable of
answering detailed technical questions . In any event, having left the
Programme in late January 1999, | had limited visibility of, and no involvement

with, the forward events on the Programme.

44.A PA Consulting review of the Programme was undertaken during the second
half of 1997. The report was published in October 1997 with one
recommendation being that the PDA be wound up and the functions transferred

to BA or POCL.

45. This recommendation was accepted and from that time, my activity focused on
ensuring that the appropriate functions of the PDA were transferred to POCL or
the BA. This was achieved by April 1998 when the PDA was replaced by the
Horizon Project Team in POCL, with appropriate POCL representation at the
BA Caps and Card Programme Board. All transition activity was signed off in

September 1998.

46.From April 1998 | became the Caps Business Director within BA and | left the
Caps project in late January 1999. This is how my involvement with the Horizon

project came to an end.

47.1 have been asked to explain what | understood to be the factors which had
caused or contributed to the decision of BA to cancel the BPC. By May 1999,
when the ministerial decision was taken to cancel the Benefit Payment Card

contract, | was no longer working on the programme.

Page 14 of 18
WITNO04160100
WITNO04160100

48. My personal belief was that the decision of the Benefits Agency to cancel the
benefit payment card was linked to the issues highlighted in the contract breach
in November 1997. Briefly, these were the continued erosion of the Business
Case and uncertainty of future delivery dates from Pathway but likely to be
some 3 years later than originally planned. Understandably, the BA had been
exploring contingency options and believed that a viable contingency of paying

benefits direct to client bank accounts existed.

49.1 have been asked to consider to what extent did the technical issues and
robustness of the Horizon project influence the decision of BA to cancel the
BPC. As a member of the Caps and Cards Project Board until late January
1999 when | moved to alternative duties within DWP IT, | was aware of the
continuing discussion across government in pursuit of a way forward for the
BA/POCL Programme. Similarly, | was aware that a number of solutions were
being considered (e.g. continue with the current approach, overall cancellation
of the Pathway contract, removal of the Benefit Payment Card aspect but with

automation of Post Offices being contracted with POCL and Pathway etc.).

50. The final decision to cancel the Benefit Payment Card contract was taken after
| had left the PDA and the Caps Programme and | had no input at that time.
However, concerns over the technical robustness of the Pathway solution had
been evident throughout the Programme re-planning cycles. The PA Consulting
review in July 1997 highlighted that there would be continuing reservations

around such aspects as security, scalability and performance of the Pathway

Page 15 of 18
WITNO04160100
WITNO04160100

solution until the final system was realised. These aspects had not been proved
in a Live Trial at the time of cancellation of the Benefit Payment Card. So, along
with the Business Case issues and doubts over Pathways ability to achieve
future delivery dates, | believe these technical concerns would undoubtedly

have influenced the BA’s position.

51.1 have been asked to comment on whether the Horizon IT system was fit for
purpose at the point in which my involvement came to an end. By the time |
fully left the Programme, the Pathway Horizon Solution had proved to be
satisfying the limited demands of paying Child Benefit in some 200 Post Offices.
It had never reached the level of maturity required for use by 30 plus benefits
across 19,000 locations. | therefore had limited confidence that the Pathway
system was capable of supporting the Programme objectives at that time.
However, | was confident that activity across Government would identify a
forward approach which would provide enhanced prospects of achieving the

sponsors objectives.

52.1 have no other matters that | consider would assist the Chair.
