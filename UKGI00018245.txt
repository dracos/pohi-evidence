Horizon claims

POL/HF/RW

Susan Crichton

This is also a separate agenda item for the
September 2013 Board meeting.

POL has received various claims from
subpostmasters (SPMs) alleging defects in the
Horizon system and POL’s internal processes.

These allegations were initially made in 5
claims brought through solicitors Shoosmiths.
Similar allegations have been made through:

-  SPMs’ MPs;

- the “Justice for
Alliance” (JFSA);

- defences to court proceedings brought
by POL to recover debts from SPMs;
and

- direct contact with POL.

Subpostmasters

An independent investigator Second Sight
Support Services Ltd (Second Sight) has been
reviewing these allegations in consultation with
James Arbuthnot MP and JFSA.

On 08.07.13, Second Sight published an
Interim Report finding shortcomings in POL’s
internal training and support to SPMs on the
Horizon system, but no systemic problems with
Horizon itself.

Following the Second Sight Interim Report,
on 27.08.13 POL launched a Mediation
Scheme aimed at finally resolving individual

complaints made about Horizon
Submissions to the scheme close on
18.11.13

Second Sight is continuing to investigate the
SPMs’ concerns. POL is cooperating with
those investigations.

POL is also reviewing past and present
criminal prosecutions brought against SPMs
to ensure they continue to satisfy the
evidential, public interest, and disclosure
standards required for prosecutions

POL is not issuing any new criminal
summons pending the instruction of a new,
independent expert who can give evidence to
support the Horizon system. The process of
identifying this expert is underway.

To date, no claim has been made against
POL in the civil courts, and no appeal has
been made to the Court of Appeal against
any conviction obtained in the criminal
courts, following the Interim Report.
