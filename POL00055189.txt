POST OFFICE LIMITED -v- ALISON HENDERSON
NORWICH MAGISTRATES’ COURT - 7 OCTOBER 2010 - COMMITTAL PROCEEDINGS
CASE: POLTD/0910/0167

The above-named entered a not guilty plea in relation to the Current charge. The charge has
been amended to read between 1° January 1997 and 10" February 2010. Clearly, this
cannot be the full period of the fraud and no doubt some indication as to the beginning date
will be given in due course.

The prosecution are now required to prepare the witness and exhibit bundles and serve the
disclosure evidence. I would be grateful if the statements as outlined in my advice of 21° May
could be obtained. In addition to those statements, it would be helpful to understand why the
audit took place on 10" February.

I am sure that this case will be one of those cases where the Horizon evidence will be
challenged and in due course I expect we will need to obtain expert evidence from Mr Jenkins
of Fujitsu.

If there are any difficulties please do not hesitate to contact me at this office.
