Subject Matching acceptance criteria to acceptance incidents
Keith

Initial results from the exercise of identifying additional acceptance criteria to our existing
acceptance incidents indicates that there is an opportunity for additional criteria to be added
and therefore potentially additional acceptance incidents to be generated.

Taking acceptance incident 211 - one where we expected additional criteria to be available - we
have now matched the incident to 5 criteria. Whilst in theory this could therefore result in 5
incidents, the risk we run if we were to split the incident in this way is that we then reduce the
severity of the incidents from a Medium to a Low.

lam happy to discuss with you the results of the work so far with a view to considering the
extent to which we continue and how we use the information we have.

John
