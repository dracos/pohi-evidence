Joanne,

As discussed with Steve, can you raise separate calls for the 13 branches showing on the attached spreadsheet.
Please quote KEL acha5650L.

They won't all necessarily need BIMS, but some will. Let me know when you start raising them as I want to intercept one
or two where I've already done most of the work.
