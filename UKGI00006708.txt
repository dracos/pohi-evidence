Subject: POL & Horizon

Patrick / Gareth — as you know the Horizon issue at POL is moving in to legal territory. Whilst we have previously just
patched Patrick in as and when necessary, I don’t think we can discount there being a need for more regular legal
input in the near future of proceedings really do kick off. Do you think you should bring in a G6 or G7 on to this, or are
you content to continue to be involved more directly. Happy either way, but just thought I would flag that additional
resource or time might be needed soon.

Thanks
