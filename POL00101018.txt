Subject: Note to MPs

Dear James,

Thank you for your letter of 8 July 2014 and the opportunity to comment on the update you will be sending to
MPs. I have two main thoughts and one minor comment.

Firstly, whilst I understand that your colleagues may be keen for more detail on individual cases, as we have
previously discussed it would not be in the interests of applicants or the integrity of the Scheme to disclose
such detail. The terms of the Scheme provide an assurance of confidentiality to applicants. We will of course
be pleased to continue to update on the overall progress of the Scheme but individual case details cannot be
shared at any point, including at the end of the Scheme. I do think it is important that this is set out in your
note to colleagues, and that the third paragraph is amended accordingly.

Secondly, while I agree entirely that the overall process is taking longer than any of us originally anticipated, I
do think this message should be balanced with the fact that progress is now being made, as Sir Anthony
Hooper’s update sets out, including with the first two cases progressing to mediation and a further 11 cases
resolved in advance of mediation.

Finally, there is a small typo in my name in the first paragraph.

If it would be helpful to discuss these issues directly I would be very happy to arrange a phone call.

Kind regards,
Paula
