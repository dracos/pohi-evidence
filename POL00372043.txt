Dear Mr Thompson

Even after the interim report into the Horizon system, you still maintain your confidence in the

system.

Well let me tell you. When the final report is published it will spell the end of your tenure.

Thankfully, due to a 'mole' within your organisation, we are in possession of some incredibly
damaging information regarding the role of the NFSP in this whole affair.
Ihave had my life ruined and my name soiled within my own community after working so
incredibly hard at my former branch.

The assistance offered to me by you, and the NFSP was nothing short of incredulous.

I paid my union dues for many years, only to find that when i required assistance from you,

absolutely nothing was forthcoming and the realisation that your organisation was merely fake.

Looking forward to witnessing the end of your employment, and with the information in my
possession, your life to be ruined too

sincerely

Richard Blackshaw
