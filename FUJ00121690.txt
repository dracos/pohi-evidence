Subject: Additional Evidence - Cleverly
Attachments: 04-08-05 HSH Call Volume Analysis v2.doc; 04-08-05 1st to 4th Line Support v2.doc

Attached two documents with additional evidence as requested at Tuesday's Conference Call. I have one final piece to
pull together, the ‘Clean Start’, but this will not take long to do.

The information is of necessity detailed and may have to be tailored to suit the Court environment. If that is the case I
would need sight of any changes to ensure that the integrity of Fujitsu's additional evidence has not been jeopardised.

I would like confirmation from the Post Office and Weightmans that this information is satisfactory.

Regards,
