Requirements Version: 2.0
Date: 13/07/01

1 Introduction

ICL Pathway is currently responding to the Network Banking Requirements
Catalogue issued by PON in support of their automated network banking
project. One key requirement is NBR0448.

[Requirement INBRO448

The implementation of the banking product on the Horizon architecture must be
ssly integrated and transparent to the user. It must not degrade any aspect of
ting service nor must it affect the availability and functionality of existing
Iproducts.

Note: Except for the rearrangement of the menu hierarchy to cater for the
introduction of the banking solution.
limpacted System/s:[IBM, ICL Pathway & PON

This document identifies a number of Internal Audit Requirements (IAR)

for the audit solution that_are required if it _is_not_to_be degraded
through the addition of Network Banking service.

The Audit Data Storage and Retrieval HLD [2] states that the “.... facilities are
designed to be generic and extensible, in particular any new applications
introduced into the Horizon system should interface to the Audit Server ....”.
The design was, however, limited to those storage and retrieval volumes
associated with the Horizon system at CSR+ and the current implementation

reflects those volumes.

The current implementation, shown at Annex A (Archive and Storage) and
Annex B (Retrieval and Extraction), has functioned reasonably well since it
was ‘switched on’ and any failures have been recovered within acceptable
timescales.

However, it is clear that the current implementation is operating at its limits
and will not, in its current guise, continue to meet the new, increased
operational requirements brought about by Network Banking. Section 3 of this
document identifies a number of limitations, system and operational, which
are being tolerated now but will, unless addressed, cause the audit solution
and ultimately the Horizon system, to fail.

The Requirements in Section 4 are raised as Pathway Internal Audit
requirements to satisfy Network Banking and have been given a prefix of IA to
differentiate them from any requirements placed by POCL in any of their
Requirements Catalogues

Section 5 identifies a number of issues surrounding these requirements and
any proposed solution to meet them.

The following requirements, extracted from the Requirements Catalogue [5],
are directly related to the internal requirements identified in this document.

3 Related EFTPoS Requirements

EFTPoS is an additional service that is being introduced within Network
Banking timescales and will be enabled through the NWB service.
Requirements have been defined and these will have an effect on the audit
solution in two main areas, transaction volumes and retrieval requests.

Current estimates for transaction volumes assume ~50Million when fully
implemented. It is anticipated that the transaction files sent to the Merchant
Acquirer on a daily basis will be included in the overall Pathway Audit
Archive.

Retrieval requirements are not quantified but have been identified as
required.

While each of these requirements is small in comparison to the main Network
Banking requirements they act to exacerbate the current situation and
reinforce the need to make the improvements identified in this document.

The following EFTPoS requirements, extracted from the Statement of
Requirements [7], are directly related to the internal requirements identified
in this document.

EFT7 I Support for up to 50M EFTPoS transactions and the authorisation volumes
specified by end of year 2. (N.B. See Section 9.3.4. for note on the effect of
Authorisation Floor Limits).

EFT1 Ie Refused authorisations are recorded in the Data Warehouse for recording and
8 reporting purposes.

EFT2 I Use of daily Hot Card File when operating floor limits, (see 4.2.2). However, if
4 the impact on transaction times is negligible and the system design is
simplified, the HCF may be cross referenced even when no floor limits are in
use.

The following ‘Industry Standard Requirement’, also to be found in [7], is
relevant to the Audit Solution.

ISR8_ I Access to historic information during data retention periods. Chargebacks can be
instigated up to 180days after transaction date for Visa schemes, (120 days for
Switch). Consequently transaction data must be accessible during these periods.

4 Current Limitations

4.1 Non-Audit Use of Audit Server

The Audit Server is used as a back-up server for a number of key servers
within the Horizon system. These include the Correspondence, ACDB, OCMS
and KMA Servers. This secondary usage was first introduced in TD/DES/086
: Correspondence Server Message Store Backup and Recovery for Release 2
as a secondary use for the Audit Server that had, at that time, spare capacity.

There are a number of issues with this arrangement :

a. Now that full data volumes are being experienced there are pressures
on the schedule to be able to complete all CS backups in time for the
primary Audit Solution work to take place.

b. The number of Legato drives (6 per site) was as per the original Audit
Solution design [2]. No increase in numbers was made to
accommodate the CS backup work.

The contention for DLT drives exacerbates the DLT handling issues .

The full impact of increases in audit data volumes on the backup
activity is not known.

The advent of Network Banking and the experience to date suggests that the
use of the Audit Server for non-audit work should be reconsidered and a
dedicated solution put in place.

This problem is mitigated through the introduction of a fully automated tape
silo.

4.2 Broken Audit Trail

We have experienced the complete loss of the TMS Journal element of the
audit trail covering a six-day period from 8" — 14 August 2000. The problem
stems from a DLT failure at both sites for the same period of time. It was
exacerbated by TNT managing to lose the Wigan tape that was being sent to
FELO1 for more detailed analysis. The Bootle tape was sent to Vogon, data
recovery specialists, for analysis who confirmed that they would be able to
recover some, but not all, of the data. The odds of two DLTs simultaneously
failing in the same place in two separate locations must be very high but they
did and as a consequence Pathway is technically in breach of contract.

The cause of the failure is not known. However, since 1998 it has been
pointed out that the continued manual handling of DLTs increases the risks of
accidental or deliberate loss of or damage to tapes and that the introduction

FUJ00171967
FUJ00171967

ICL Pathway Network Banking Internal Audit Ref: IA/REQ/005

Requirements Version: 2.0
Date: 13/07/01

of automated tape silos at he Data Centres would mitigate against this (and
other) risks.

Evidence obtained during a recent OBCS audit shows that DLTs are not
being used and cycled as expected resulting in potential over-use of tapes.

While it is true that this has no direct relationship with Network Banking the
increase in transaction volumes and associated retrievals will exacerbate the
tape handling problems that are being experienced.

4.3 Escalating Retrieval Requests

The current Archive and Storage implementation of the audit solution is a
balance between the cost of storage and the frequency with which data has to
be retrieved.

The Audit Data Retrieval Requirements [1], generated with the help of Post
Office Internal Audit (and, at the time, Benefit Agency Internal Audit) identified
that the number of retrievals that they anticipated requesting would be in the
tens per year. Based on this a DLT based solution was implemented.

Since then two further categories of retrieval request have emerged :

a. Retrievals in support of internal support requests, usually made by
MSU or SSC. The SSC requests have diminished greatly since they
introduced their own rolling 6 months support data store. MSU
requests are exceptional and only occur when they cannot source
information from the Data Warehouse.

b. PON Security Investigations. This group require data to support their
investigations and ultimately prosecutions for fraud. Originally they did
not express any requirements for access to audit data so were not
taken into account. Historically they were to obtain their data from the
Fraud Risk Management Service (FRMS), a BA service that
disappeared when BA withdrew from the contract. They are now the
main requesters for audit data and have stated, but not substantiated,
a continuing need for ~500 retrievals per year.

The debate surrounding the PON SI requirements has been escalated back
to the Contract and both sets of solicitors have been involved. Following
meetings in May 2000 and March 2001 a letter has been sent to PON
accepting that Pathway will perform 50 retrievals per rolling 12-month period.
Although accepted at the March meeting, attempts to get agreement to
CCN759, which would change Requirement 699 to reflect this, have been
rejected. The situation remains unresolved.

4.4 Extraction Process Restrictions

Apart from the limitations of DLT handling at the Data Centres, one of the
major limiters to the number of retrievals that can be serviced is the extraction
process itself and the architecture of the audit server and workstation.

There are two stages to the retrieval process :

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Page 10 of 18
FUJ00171967

FUJ00171967
ICL Pathway Network Banking Internal Audit Ref. IA/REQ/005
Requirements Version: 2.0
Date: 13/07/01
a. Stage one is where data files are retrieved from the DLT and placed
into directories on the audit server.
b. Stage two is where the relevant records are extracted from the files on

the audit workstation, analysed and written to CD.

For non-TMS files the transition from stage one to stage two is usually
achieved by dragging the files across the network. However, for TMS
Journals it is necessary to filter out the required Outlet code(s) and date
range(s) by generating a pseudo Correspondence Server. This work has to
take place on the audit server and it is not possible to run more than 1 such
filter exercise concurrently.

This restriction is having an effect on the throughput of retrieval requests that
are taking considerably longer than originally anticipated.
The current audit Serveriworkstation architectuce.is.as follows. :

‘IRRELEVANT.

The workstations at Wigan and Bootle exist for resilience purposes and
anticipated use by North based audit staff. In reality these have never been
used in anger and one could be moved to Feltham to provide a dual
capability. However, the need to run the filtering activities on the audit server
mitigates against any real benefit being derived from this arrangement.

4.5 Conclusion

When implemented and accepted in July 1999 the audit solution was
considered to be satisfactory and capable of meeting anticipated workload
and transaction levels at CSR+. The Audit Data Storage and Retrieval Design
[2] clearly states that limitation.

The completion of rollout and arrival of Network Banking and Universal
Banking will bring about significant increases in transaction traffic and likely
numbers of retrieval requests. Adding these factors to the current difficulties
could lead to further deterioration and ultimately collapse of the audit
solution.

5 Network Banking Internal Audit Requirements

5.1 Introduce Automated Tape Silos

IAR #001 : Introduce automated tape silos at the Data Centres to improve the
efficiency of data retrievals and mitigate against DLT handling risks.

The potential for the introduction and use of tape silos has been the subject
of an earlier correspondence culminating in CP2084 raised on 6" July 1999
for a feasibility study into the use of an automated tape silo for the audit
server. The user justification was primarily risk based identifying the following
key risks :

a. Accidental or deliberate mis-handling of DLTs at the Data Centres.

b. Accidental or deliberate loss of DLTs.

Cc. Accidental or deliberate damage to Legato drives through increased
manual loading/unloading of DLTs.

d. Industrial action/non co-operation by ISD.

e. Potential for unacceptable delay in the audit data retrieval activity on

behalf of the customer.

In the event the work was not completed and a Feasibility Report was not
produced.

Of the five risks identified 3 have already manifested themselves, two (a. &
b.) evidenced by the break in the audit trail described in Para 3.2 and one (e.)
in Para 3.4. The arguments for introducing tape silos for the audit server are
now stronger than ever and would go a long way to mitigate the impact of
larger audit data volumes and increased retrieval requests.

5.2 Remove Non-Audit Work on Audit Server

JAR #002 : Remove non-audit related work from the Audit Server.

The Audit Server is used to backup Correspondence and other Servers at the
Data Centres. This secondary use causes schedule congestion, unnecessary
DLT handling at the Data Centres and can impede the retrieval of audit data if
not completed before the start of the normal working day.

The increased volumes introduced with Network Banking will exacerbate this
problem.

Date: 13/07/01

Related EFT Requirements : EFT7 ISR8

5.3 Change Audit Server/Workstation Architecture
IAR #003 : Transfer the filtering activity and Correspondence Server build
activity from the audit server to the audit workstation.

By relieving the audit server of this workload the potential for parallel builds
and filters is limited to the number of audit workstations available and the
capability of the operator to multi task.

This would go some way to making the retrieval element of the audit solution
truly scaleable subject to the number of Audit Workstations and operators. It
follows that improved efficiency at this point in the process must be supported

by improvements in the management of DLTs, eg. The introduction of tape
silos.

IAR #004 : Move Bootle audit workstation to Feltham.

The workstations in Wigan and Bootle have never been used ‘in anger’ and
better use could be made of one of them if it were transferred to Feltham and
placed in the secure room in AO.

Bootle is selected purely on the grounds of convenience and ease of access
by the current Audit Manager.

5.4 Enable Retrieval Graphical User Interface

IAR #005 : Improve Resilience of Retrieval GUI.

This was an original CSR+ requirement that was delivered but has not
worked successfully for some time.

5.5 Improve File Selection & Retrieval

IAR #006 : Improve the file selection process to bring about more efficient
operation.

IAR #007 : Ensure that current file extraction performance will not degrade
with larger data volumes and retention periods.

Part of the Retrieval GUI involves the identification and marking of files for
retrieval. This is a time consuming activity that will increase in direct
proportion to the volume of data held and requests made for retrievals.

Provide assurance that there will be no degradation in the extraction process
as a result of increased data volumes and retention times.

5.6 Confirm Sizing & Technology

IAR #008 : Ensure that the storage technology used is appropriate for the
increased volumes and retention period of audit data and the increased
retrieval requests anticipated.

Audit data is currently stored on DLT on the grounds of cost and usage as
identified in the Audit Data Retrievals Requirements [1]. Network Banking
(and subsequently Universal Banking) brings increased data volumes,
retention period moving from 18months to 7years and, if PON SI have
anything to do with it, potentially a 10 fold increase in data retrieval requests.

Date: 13/07/01

5.7 Enhance R-Query

JAR #009 : Enhance R-Query to handle Network Banking transactions and
improve the useability of the tool.

R-Query is the utility used in the extraction process to interrogate the pseudo
Correspondence Server generated on the Audit Server following retrieval
from the DLT. The tool provides parameter driven filtering based on the
Riposte attribute grammar and export facilities to MS Excel or MS Access.

Network Banking will introduce new attribute grammar to the Horizon system
that must be interpretable by both Pathway and PON audit staff.

Related NBR Requirements : NBRO315
Related EFT Requirements : ISR8

5.8 Provide Attribute Grammar Catalogue

IAR #010 : Provide a comprehensive catalogue of the attribute grammar used
in the Horizon system.

This requirement has been outstanding for some time. TMS records contain a
huge amount of detail whose meaning is defined through the attributes
associated with it. Partial catalogues for applications exist in isolation but
there is a need to consolidate these into a single Attribute Grammar
Catalogue. Without this it is difficult to determine which attributes are the
appropriate ones for filtering and almost impossible to decipher a TMS record
to determine what the content actually means. This is particularly so for
casual users.

This Requirement is important in light of the steady reduction of experienced
staff from the project.

Assuming that there will not be any increases in resource to carry out the
increased number of audit data retrievals it is imperative that this
consolidated document is delivered with Network Banking.

5.9 Capture Network Banking Data

JAR #011 : Capture and store Network Banking audit data that meets
contractual, security and audit requirements and in a format that is accessible
for subsequent interpretation by ICL Pathway and PON Auditors.

There may be security requirements placed upon the Network Banking data
over and above existing audit data such that it may have to be stored in an
encrypted form. There is no current requirement for this data to be decrypted
on delivery to PON Audit.

Related EFT Requirements : EFT7 EFT18 EFT24

5.10 Conclusion

The introduction of Network Banking will bring about increases in three key

areas :
a. Transaction volumes.
b. Data retention period.
c. Requests for audit data retrievals.

The requirements expressed in this document are intended to mitigate
against these increases while at the same time address current system
limitations.

By far the most effective improvement would be the introduction of tape silos.
There will be a cost associated with this but the alternative is an escalation of
the problems we have already experienced. Indeed, the broken audit trail
scenario has had to be formally reported to PON IA and we are now
technically in breach of contract.

It will not solve all the current problems, for example it will not resolve the
issue of the ~500 PON SI requests, but it will go a long way to streamlining
both the day to day management of DLTs and the ad hoc data retrieval
requests currently received.

6 Issues

There are a number of unresolved issues surrounding these requirements :

a. Neither PON SI nor PON IA have been able to provide substantive
figures for data retrievals. A meeting held on 18" June between PON
and Pathway identified this as an issue.

b. Who bears the cost of implementing changes to upgrade the audit
solution (part of the infrastructure) to handle Network Banking? The
changes have to be made to allow Network Banking to operate without
degrading the existing service.
