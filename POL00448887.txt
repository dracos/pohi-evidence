Ben,

As I said in my note It needs to go through Noms and the Board , and then UKGI and DBT .

It has been discussed between the NEDs inc The Post Masters but not Lorna . It was unanimous except for for one
NED but was also the wish of our CEO . We did agree that you would not be involved as you were stepping down . I
am fulfilling the request of the Board .

Henry,

This is a decision which requires a proper board discussion and the agreement of the shareholder, neither
of which have occurred. I also note that the SID position has already been externally advertised and indeed
there is a Sky news story reporting that I am stepping down. So the external recruitment process is live and
in the public domain.

Following the decision to appoint an internal candidate the vote was to appoint Andrew as our SID .
Congratulations to Andrew . Of course this requires an approval by the NomsCo and Board and then UKGI and
others .

Rachel will put the headhunters on hold on Monday . Lorna will inform UKGI of our decision to change course and I
will inform the Chair and CEO of UKGI when I meet them on Tuesday . There are other procedures to go through
with DBT.

Even in the last days or so there has been plenty happening particularly from organisations representing Post
Masters . Our "Post Master centric " strategy already looks as if it may need to be adapted . I will ask Rachel to copy
you with the relevant letters from Post Master organisations .

There will be plenty to discuss at our private meeting with just Nick and the NEDs . This will need to be before the
Board and Nick has kindly adapted the Agenda to allow us time for a 90 minute meeting if we need the time. We
need to try and get on the front foot in due course so all your thoughts would be helpful .

Have a good weekend .
Henry
