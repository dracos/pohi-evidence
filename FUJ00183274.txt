Gareth / Torstein

An early look at the SSC comments to:
2. analysis of Robert's sample of 50 KELs (Gareth/Steve);
3. analysis of the KELs referred to in Coyne's report (Gareth/Steve); and

Unfortunately I missed Jonathan’s instruction re “When completing the attached tables for 2 and 3 please would the
writer analyse the KELs in their own words, rather than referring to Robert's analysis” so will need do some further
amendments (mainly cut and paste) on Monday!
