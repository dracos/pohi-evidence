New, Nak ,

I just wanted to congratulate you on your success in securing this prestigious role at the
helm of one of the most important and well-loved British companies.

I have been watching avidly from the side-lines, receiving regular updates on the highly
competitive recruitment process. You clearly impressed our Minister and other panel
members with a breadth of experience which will both allow you to quickly grasp the
complexities of the company and push it in new directions.

Indeed, some of this complexity lies in the company's relationship with Government.
Fortunately, this has been well-managed in recent times by dedicated colleagues in UKGI,
and our team BEIS led by the excellent Carl Creswell.

As I'm sure you'll have gathered by now, it's a fascinating and dynamic time for the Post
Office, and I am excited to hear your vision for its long-term success. May I suggest that
you, me and Carl sit down for a chat once you—and indeed the political situation—are more
settled? Shall we aim for early September?

Alex Chisholm
