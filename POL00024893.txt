Subject: Re: Remote Access wording - subject to litigation privilege [BD-4A.FID26859284]

This is good.

We also need to see please all we have said on "remote access".

One more comment (a bit more stretching)...

Ref:
You say that Post Office has concealed its "ability to remotely alter transactions" but this
allegation is too imprecise to be a basis on which to extend limitation:

You could add:

The post office has zero capability to technically alter transactions. It's software supplier FJ, as
outlined previously, has tightly controlled access which requires precise instructions to execute
or is used for maintenance/ defect fix - again acting as agents for PO and to keep the system
running not to alter live transactionS.

Please find attached the proposed wording on the remote access issue — for discussion on our call at
6pm today.

Three points to bear in mind when reviewing:

1. In light of comments yesterday, we've provided a slightly longer explanation so to hopefully
present this issue in a better light.

2. Tony agrees with the current wording but has reiterated the importance of dealing with this point
candidly, even if that does cause some short-term pain.

3. We do not yet have a 100% clear picture on some of the technical and operation issues on this
topic. We therefore need to be careful not to overstate our case. This draft wording will also
need to be run past Deloitte / FJ.

Kind regards
