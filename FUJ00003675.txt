April 2005

Contract negotiations were prolonged due to the complex
nature of this deal and the number of service streams requiring
further definition.

We awaited publication of the Councils’ 05/06 Budgets, which
required further Due Diligence (DD). As a result, the anticipated
Contract date slipped to the end of June 2005.

Client relationships continued to be good during a period of
negotiation for both sides and politicians also continued to be
supportive.

July 2005

Contract negotiations continue to take more time than originally
planned due to the complex nature of this deal, the number of
service streams requiring definition and the agreement of the
in-scope service specifications.

The Council's budgets, as identified at ITN and BAFO, have
been reduced due to “errors and/or duplications”. This has
resulted in further delay. Both the Council and Fujitsu are
seeking a different affordability business case. The Council are
seeking to redress budget shortfall, wherever they can and
Fujitsu are endeavouring to reduce cost from either our prime
contractor costs or our major sub contractors. Particular focus
is upon Vertex as their costs (and price) are considered to be
overstated by both the Council and Fujitsu.

We continue to have protracted dialogue with Vertex to redress
their cost base further. Fujitsu are considering stepping into
particular service streams where Vertex are not cost effective
eg HR

An objective of both the Council and Fujitsu, is to reduce the
reliance on risk/reward business cases that existed at BAFO
stage.

Project Stealth. This deal is likely to involve the ‘Total’ end-to-
end Desktop Managed Services in 9 European countries —
approx 80k seats of which 20% is in the UK. The deal involves
desktop lifecycle management, support, help desk, staff
transfer and also possibly LAN/WAN management.

April 2005

Due to various re-organisations within France Telecom Group
and + Main Board and Executive Director Changes,
the RFP process was delayed again. The Programme was
reinvigorated and the Programme Director responsible for the
outsource referred to by prospect as DMS is back on track.
Following ‘internal’ due diligence across all (8 countries)
concerned the RFP was issued mid-May 2005.

July 2005
FS responded to the FT RFP in June and have subsequently
been short-listed from 8 suppliers to 4.

On 20th July, a team from FS including Jack Noble and Roger
Camrass presented to the customer and discussed the merits
of the FS proposition with 20 delegates representing UK,
Poland, NL, Belgium, Spain and FT Procurement. We are
confident that, following further site visits to FS to understand
more about Sense and Respond, FS will be down-selected to
the final 2 short-listed suppliers. Decision for down-select to 2
is expected by the end of July/ early August 2005.

contract from 2010 to 2015

March 2005

June 2005

Software Development & Managed Services
Kevin Spence

Migration of existing Horizon application suite to centralised
(datacentre) orientated solution. This will release substantial
operational cost savings for Post Office, reduce the complexity
of the solution and hasten time to market for the introduction of
new functionality (Post Office products) in the future.
Opportunity is being jointly progressed between Fujitsu and
Post Office without competition.

April 2005

Revised estimates submitted to Post Office mid April. These
were to form the basis of a negotiation which would lead to
contract.

Post Office have elected to introduce a “Due Diligence” process
prior to agreeing contract. This was intended to confirm their
“operational readiness” and provide them with independent
assurance that they have approached the procurement
correctly.

Target for contract signature was the end of Jun 2005 but the
Due Diligence activity introduced the risk of slippage.

July 2005

Recently appointed Operations Director for Post Office (Ric
Francis) has changed the requirements associated with the
project and Post Office’s basis for decision. However the
prospect of a “deal” remains good.

This change has demanded a re-think of Fujitsu’s bid strategy
and target solution. Work is now in hand to submit a new offer
to Post Office by end of August 2005. This would provide the
basis for a new contract for implementation by end of March
2006.

Ric Francis is proving to be a challenging character to work
with, introducing a much more demanding, risk-taking, retail
centric view of the project.

Infrastructure and Applications Maintenance Outsource
Gary Moggridge

BAe Systems are assessing the possibility of moving from their
current Outsource contract with CSC.

April 2005

FS had been invited to submit a response to an RFI, as did
Accenture, EDS, IBM, and Capgemini.

This was to allow the BAE Main Board to assess options
available should they decide to open this opportunity to the
market. It was understood that our response was required to be
returned by mid-May 2005. The contracting agent was TPI.

July 2005

FS has now been invited to attend the first debrief of our RFI
submitted in May. We expect to be told where, in their view, we
would be best placed in their service towers, and if we are
prepared to bid should they come to market in October.

CSC have been given the RFP and a response is anticipated in
mid-August. BAe will then decide if the response meets their
objectives for the future.

Scope may raise issues related to our ability to manage a
global infrastructure, particularly the USA.

David Whitfield and Jonathan Fisher

Fujitsu Services is presently contracted to provide the Southern
Cluster (region of England) of the NHS with Picture Archiving
and Communication System functionality as part of the Local
Service Provider contract with the NHS.

The system provides for the capture and digital storage of high
quality medical images such as X-rays. Fujitsu has achieved
successful deployments of a Cluster Data Store — (a data
centre facility which stores such images for the whole Southern
region) in March 2005, a PACS system in a group of hospitals
in West Dorset in April 2005, and a further PACS system with a
Radiology Information System (RIS) in Salisbury in July 2005.

Fujitsu buys PACS systems from GE and RIS from HSS.
Fujitsu’s role is data centre host, systems integrator, first line
helpdesk and programme manager.

Following these successful deployments, and in response to
contractual delays in the North East Cluster and the East and
East Midlands Cluster, Fujitsu was asked on 12" July 2005 to
submit a bid to provide a similar solution in these additional
Clusters. The bid was submitted on 20" July 2005.

July 2005

The bid was submitted, and the customer has provided limited
informal feedback of a preliminary nature.

The customer expressed appreciation that the bid was
submitted on time, despite very short notice and also

April 2005

Competition had changed in that BT had withdrawn from the
procurement, for Lot 1 and had been replaced by T-Systems.
No replacement had been found for Lot 2.

We had been involved in consultation workshops with HMCE
and the Final ITN was to be issued in mid-May with a response
due at the end of August. BAFO was to follow with Contract
Award anticipated by February 2006.

The Proof of Solution went very well and we passed 100% of
the tests so far.

July 2005

On Tuesday 5" July, the UK government suddenly announced
that the LRUC procurement was to be cancelled immediately.
The requirement for an LRUC mechanism would be
incorporated in the plans for a wider road-charging regime as
announced in the new Labour party manifesto. Full
implementation is unlikely to occur before 2015.

Via our Prime Contractor, IBM, we are pursuing the UK

government for compensation of Proof of Solution costs and
general bid costs.

April 2005

The ITT was issued on the 21* March with a submission date
for response of the 4'" May. In the interim, the Computacenter
contract had been extended to the end of October 2005. Due to
tight timescales for response and implementation of the new
live service, Fujitsu had formally asked for extensions to these
key dates (end of May for bid submission, March 2006 for new
live service). A decision from the client was awaited.

July 2005

Decision from the client was that any extension to timescale
was unacceptable. Fujitsu then took the decision to no bid as
we did not have a competitive solution to offer against
Computacenter or SCC.

The timescales from the client did not give sufficient time to

submit a professional bid and would not give sufficient time to
build, test and implement live service.
