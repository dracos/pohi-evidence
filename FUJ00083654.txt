[Start of Response]

tue to the Riposte errors on 14/09/05 from 15:30 onwards (see call £-0509140700), messages were not replicated on counter 3. As a
result, 3 transfers in to stock unit AA were done twice, initially on other counters then again on counter 3. The transfers in
were for:

3000.00 (cash)

200.00 (cash)

s9.69 (cheques)

[this has resulted in a loss of 3489.69 in CAP 25 to the outlet, which POL may need to correct via an error notice.

Phoned the PM to explain what the problem was. He is concerned about other transactions which he has input twice (3 Giro deposits
land another cheque) because of the replication problem. Have advised him to contact the NBSC as this is a business issue.
