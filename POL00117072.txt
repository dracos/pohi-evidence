Thanks. Meant to say, I’m happy to support you any time you want it in these forums. I didn’t know about this until
too late I’m afraid

Hi all

Paula and I have briefed the Board today. Thank you for your help as ever. It was fine: more
information sharing than anything else.

One question on CCRC for Rod: what information will we be providing and when do we think we will be
doing so? Could we have done this proactively?

Best wishes,

Mark

Subject: RE: Sparrow Q&A and core narrative

Hi all,

We managed to get v2 of our answers to SS last night.

Attached is a comparison on what was supplied as v1 compared to what was supplied at v2.

Below are the finalised number splits for the respective answers given to date. You will note that now — excluding
those (3) agreed by the WG as to wide (this is a decision taken by the WG not the PO), Post Office has only refused to

answer 4 of the 109 questions posed by Second Sight. Though they may disagree at the select committee, if we stick
to this line — I am happy we can rebut anything thrown with confidence

Subject: FW: Sparrow Q&A and core narrative

Hi-— can we please make sure we stick to the agreed distribution list (I was working late last night on a version which
had been superseded by the one below).

I have also been asked to comment on the draft opening statement, but am no longer sure which is the correct
version.

Thanks, Rod

Subject: Sparrow Q&A and core narrative

Dear Paula

Please find attached the Q&A document for the Select Committee. Apologies for the delay in getting this to you.
(Mike is pulling together a more general briefing on wider issues in case raised by Committee members.)

Also attached is a suggested core narrative, broken down into bullets. We are working this up into a draft opening
statement which I will circulate tomorrow.

Best wishes

Jane

Jane Hill I Head of Public Affairs
