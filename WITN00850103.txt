Notice of Termination

On- site Post Office Ltd Local Post Office® Agreement between Post
Office Ltd and Sids News Ltd (the Operator) dated 18 May 2015
(Agreement)

As you are aware from my letter dated 06 November 2017 and our meetings on
15 November 2017 and 05 December 2017 Post Office Limited was investigating
the loss of £57,543.92 following the audit carried out on 10 October 2017. Post
Office Limited's investigations have now concluded.

Further details are given below.
Breaches of Agreement

I have reviewed this case very carefully, In particular, I have taken into account
the information you supplied to me and the details you gave at our meetings.
However following a full review and testing of that information, it is clear that
there is no evidence to support your reasons for the shortage and therefore the
fact remains that there has been no satisfactory explanation for the loss found at
the audit.

In addition, further investigation has shown that you regularly failed to complete
the daily cash declarations for the branch and also repeatedly failed to return
excess cash to Post Office Ltd when requested to do so. It is noted that you
subsequently repaid the full amount of £57,543.92 on 12 November 2017.
