Thanks Sophie

The only other though I have just had is a core brief which we update weekly and we can then use it to cut and paste
into various Board papers etc. And have one version of the truth.

Probably just for limited circulation among the core team.
Thanks so much for being ever willing and able.

Best wishes
Belinda

Hi Belinda,
In terms of comms I wanted to let you know what I’m working on and make sure I’ve included everything.

* Mediation Scheme closed message + channel / audience it will go to (Ill get this drafted and sort tomorrow).
© FCA, ASMs and field team

o SSMs +hghe .
© Intranet 4 Ao rary.
© Subspace Coe bre trot coho

© Full Q&A (I’ll have a version I can send to you tomorrow) ve
* Narrative: why we are where we are, what’s happened so far

eo Audience evaluation (what do they believe and understand now, what do we want them to believe and
understand, how do we bridge the gap)

* Handling Plan for the James Arbuthnot update meeting with MPs in January (follow on from original gathering)
+ Posy Clascy Hote hore —exaby hex -SAneg,

We can speak tomorrow about what I can help with whilst you’re away next week but I think the mains thing was
the briefings (exco and for Alice).

I will also have a go at setting out a bit of a project outline for when you're back as well.

List more for me but thought !’d share ©

* 82-Applications accepted by WG
® 38-Applicants still to submit their Full funding agreements — (6 applicants we have waited 3 weeks +, I am

chasing these)

confirmed)

© We have only received 10 Case Questionnaires 8 are accepted, 2 returned as not sufficient. ( I expect we will
get a lot more in the next week as was a slow start due to the confusion with the funding agreements).

Thanks

Hi Mark (Jane, copying you in for information),

I know you have the steering group at 1pm — below is a short update on comms that might be

e useful.

« I worked with Andy P to create the ‘Managing Expectations Gap’ document (attached)
©. There is a big expectation gap and we need to manage MP expectations.
© By the 18" November my guestimate is that at least 100 MPs will have a constituent
involved in the process (including the likes of Oliver Letwin, Michael Gove, George
Osborne, Tessa Munt).
o° Interms of managing expectations I think we need an outline of what the different
audiences (JFSA, SS, James Arbuthnot, MPs, SPMRS) think now, what we want them to
think at the end of this and how we can address it (happy to draft and get to you and
Jane for sign-off by the end of the week)
«Precise are creating a report for us on all media coverage of Horizon (sparrow team paying ©)
@ We need to work ona handling plan for the James Arbuthnot meeting with MPs in January
(happy to draft and get a version to you and Jane for sign-off by the end of this week)
e  ’m working on a bumper Q&A document to help with lines to take (based on what we have so
far, mediation pack and questions I think might come up when the mediation starts from MPs) —
lll liaise with Simon to get a briefing document for the mediation stage of this project.

Anything else you need let me know. — her
