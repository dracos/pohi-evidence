369 I 3 3 I The roving lab, based upon bar-code evaluation equipment
supplied by ICL Pathway was set up on 9/9 and roved successfully
in the North East on 10/9 targeting Receive operations. All bar-
codes on witnessed Receive operations were read successfully.

The report of the comparative live testing at Borough (Horizon) and
Elephant & Castle (ALPS) of both 88 new specification and 100
current specification bar-coded covers is provided herewith. (All
100% successful).

Pathway has supplied Word 6 level versions of the reports for the
lab testing of 90 new specification and 100 current specification
covers. (These were, in fact, Appendices A and B of the draft test
plan.)

POCL has supplied to ICL Pathway the Appendix C, the DSS
statistics. In summary these estimate the % failure rate for the
weeks 29/3/99 through 7/5/99 for ALPS operations as 0.0099 and
for Horizon as 0.2445. The current % failure rate of Horizon is
shown below for the period since two contributory factors were
discovered (incorrect treatment on non-bar-coded books and
processing foils without books present). These do not necessarily
exclude all cases where the user has set aside a foil for later
processing and processed it incorrectly notifying a bar-code reader
failure.

The training documentation will be revised to be most emphatic that
non-bar-coded books should not be Received as if they were bar-
coded.

POCL will issue instructions for individual offices to conform to
correct practices. Note also that new Horizon Offices (from
Borough High Street onwards) have been notified to use OBCS bar-
code scanning for Receive only of bar-coded order books.

An updated proposal to the Expert, in which ICL Pathway contend
this should not be an Acceptance Incident, is tabled herewith.

On 11/9 POCL issued new instructions such that only the Live Trial
offices will use bar-code scanning operations for all functions and
new offices will use them only for Receive functions. New offices
and some Live Trial offices are, however, continuing to put through
non-bar-coded books as “manual”.

The Pathway contribution to the roving lab report for 10/9 is tabled
herewith. Although all bar-codes scanned by Horizon 100% there
is some evidence that some bar-codes were non-conforming.

369 I 7 6 WM has notified ICL Pathway that “following the recent success of
rectification activities on OBCS and a greater level of clarity of the
root causes of the incident rates, POCL now consider this as a
Medium severity incident with an agreed rectification plan[POCL
rectification plan to be approved by POCL, DSS and Pathway,
BA/ACC/020, Version 0.2, 15/9/99)”.

ICL Pathway has therefore agreed to recategorise this as Medium
and has raised the Final Al form.

The review was held and POCL reported it was satisfactory.

378 I 3 5 I There is no new root cause. TIP 916 is a repeat of TIP 908. The fix
for associated PinICLs 28547 and 28566 is expected to be
implemented 14/9.

The TIP incident 916 is similar to 908 in that the pointer that
enables the harvester to locate the Cash Account records was null.
However, the reason for it being null is not yet understood.

Pathway is implementing diagnostic code that, in addition to logging
the incident in the message store for further investigation, will repair
the null pointer or display an error message to guide the user to
restart the process.

beyond.

ICL Pathway now seeks agreement to this Resolution Plan.

A revised Resolution Plan has been produced and includes the
dates when target SLAs will be met.

408 I 7 2 I The solution for service levels for Cash Account calls was
discussed at the workshop on 7-8/9. In outline, it is proposed that a
quality measure is adopted and operated jointly by ICL Pathway
and POCL NBSC such that a target of 95% conformance with the
newly agreed scripts is achieved. The measure would be by
periodic inspection or audit of all Cash Account calls at POCL’s
convenience.

used for resolution has been agreed and further subdivision by
POCL of some of these categories for CAP 22 to make 21
categories/subcategories in all is being reconciled.

The sequencing of fixes both applied and in progress is published
routinely on the ICL Pathway intranet. It has been agreed that this

For week 23 POCL wished to include a further 140 calls. These
related to events that Pathway does not classify as affecting system
stability: e.g. routine system management notifications, printer
Paper jams, certain system busy events and a number of no-entry
displays on log-off.

For week 24 Pathway and POCL are performing a joint analysis.
Indications to 8/9 are that POCL agrees closely with the Pathway

369} 1 1 IThe write up of laboratory tests on both the 100 “current specification”
covers, and a retest of the 90 “new specification covers” were
completed and submitted to POCL. The tests show that both samples
ican be read 100% by both the Horizon and ALPS scanners.

Pathway has provided POCL with daily data for bar-code read fails
for the period since 27/8. One FAD accounted for about half all
instances and a few FADs for ~90%.

Pathway is in course of updating its reports to distinguish book
receipt, issue and encashment.

(An associated PinICL was fixed and distributed to the counters 29-
30/8 obviating a workaround that would lead to some over-reporting
lof bar-code read incidents.

Pathway and POCL will mount field tests of the 100 and/or 90 covers
during the week of 6/9. DSS has notified POCL that it does not wish
ito be represented. Pathway will make available Mark Barber and
John Coakes for this exercise.

Pathway is seeking to source specialist, industry standard, bar-code
evaluation equipment. This provides an objective analysis of bar-
code printed quality and is reasonably portable. This equipment is
not required for the projected field tests but would be useful in the
future.

ito discuss the plan. Pathway will require Appendices A to C.
Pathway will provide the historical data sought under section 4.2
(from ~26/7); that sought under section 4.4 (for ALPS versus OBCS
ffor March to June 1999) will not be provided by Pathway.

ICL Pathway and POCL have performed the first element of plan,
scanning of 190 covers on live OBCS and ALPS. All were 100%
successful. The report is tabled herewith.

(As regards the second element of the plan, ICL Pathway has now
purchased bar-code evaluation equipment and will be setting it up 9/9)
for use on 10/9.

ICL Pathway confirms that if a bar-coded book is Received into an
outlet for a customer previously unknown to that outlet then the OBCS)
lapplication seeks to access the remote stop list. If the
communications connection cannot be established then the user is
(correctly) prevented from Receiving the book, including by type in of
the NINO and CPP.

Pathway agreed to provide reports for estate total values for bar-code
reads to calculate estate failure rate. For 7/9 the estate failure rate,
excluding incorrect no-barcode operations (see below) was
(0.0001447, (9/62197).

Pathway agreed to provide information from calling “cluster” post
offices. The first reports for 3-7/9 have been provided. Of the 73
incidents for which contact with the outlet was made 42 related to
loperations on non-bar-coded books. This corroborates part of the
information received previously from FAD 269632. For Received
books, this involves the user falsely notifying that the system
(scanner) is not working in order to effect the Receiving of a non-bar-
coded book, which is itself not a required function. POCL is issuing
instructions to users to use the correct OBCS function (“Foils”) for
inon-bar-coded books and is introducing a Reference Data change to
improve the OBCS button legends.

ICL Pathway is investigating other evidence from the initial cluster
analysis. The bar-code quality on green books will require particular
analysis.

ICL Pathway has developed a Systems Management task that checks
ithe structure of .dll files in prescribed system directories for content
integrity. This task can be executed on a one shot basis at a
particular outlet, or can be consolidated with other systems

Sf2 2 1 ATE (Automated Targeting Engine) functioning

[The incident that occurred during the LT 2 upgrade has been tested
land fixed (incorrect handling of long error messages). The fault was
recorded and cleared through the OSD fault notification process
(PinICL is used for Pathway related incidents). Further details have
been supplied by OSD on the nature of the fault and the resolution
lundertaken:

Messages in the Tivoli Log that exceed 512 bytes caused an error inI
ATE due to a string size allocated not being long enough. The
change required was to terminate the log messages to a maximum
of 512 bytes. Testing was performed by simulating a Tivoli log with
a message greater then 512 bytes and was implemented with a ne'
release of ATE.

(As noted previously the ATE is in regular usage. ICL Pathway
continues to demonstrate its usage during normal operational
Imanagement of the live estate. Consistent with this usage, ICL
Pathway will attempt to consolidate a distribution representative of
ithe LT2 distribution during the next three months live operation.
(Representative in this sense is taken to include elements of both
Riposte and the Pathway counter applications.)

Pathway now seeks agreement to this Clearance Plan (both
elements).

376I 3 2 (A fix is in preparation that will remove the dependency of the Cash
‘Account process on the availability of Item Reference Data. The
effect of this fix will be, for end-dated Items, to ensure that any
itransactions in the week, and the system-calculated closing stock
balance, will be reported to the outlet Cash Account.

However, housekeeping (e.g. Rem In/Out) will not be possible once
ithe Item has been end-dated hence the dependency on the
procedures referred to in 2 (above) remains.

(Considerable numbers of changes were identified to the scripts, and
Inew scripts have now been produced and agreed. The scripts were
delivered to ICL KnowledgePool on 3/9 and they carried out work
lover the weekend to familiarise their trainers with their content and
delivery process. The scripts were introduced into the live
lenvironment on 8/9 and will be executed as a ‘Cash Account domain’
initially with 12 trainers on Wednesday p.m. and Thursday a.m. The
trainers have also received appropriate training in the use of
IPowerHelp, the HSH call management system. HSH staff will be
progressively trained in the use of the scripts by the trainers such that
six staff will have been trained by 17/9 and a further 14 by 30/9.

(At the workshop, agreement was reached between POCL and
Pathway that Cash Account calls were indeed a special case. The
initial HSH resource model made no distinction between Cash
‘Account and other call types and did not correctly predict the
imbalance in call incidence on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Our
Imodified model is now able to show clearly the change in daily
orkload and confirms the need for additional staff to be available
specifically to handle these Cash Account calls.

e have used the modified model to calculate the minimum staffing
levels required for the Cash Account call handling workload and this
will be monitored over the coming weeks and months to ensure that
ithe parameters to the model reflect real life experience as closely as
possible. Initially, this process will be over-resourced but it is
intended that this will be moderated over time as Cash Account script
performance is confirmed and HSH staff recruitment is accelerated.

412I - - IA Resolution Proposal is tabled herewith.
