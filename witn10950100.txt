            3.     I was assisted in drafting this statement by my legal representatives at Cohen &

                   Gresser LLP.


            MY BACKGROUND


            4.     Before I joined Post Office Limited ("POL") in 2002, I had spent my whole career in

                   banking — specifically, at Midland Bank, which became part of HSBC in 1992. 1

                   started work at Midland Bank in 1962 as a bank clerk, and ultimately worked my way

                   through the ranks to become General Manager Personal Banking at HSBC UK in

                   1999 and a member of HSBC's international executive. All told, I was at Midland

                   Bank and HSBC in various roles for forty years.


            5.     While at Midland Bank, I became a Fellow of the Institute of Financial Services, and

                   later attended London Business School, where I became a Sloan Fellow with

                   distinction.


            6.     Throughout my career I also held external non-executive board roles, including

                   Chairman of Mondex International (which comprised 21 global banks and developed

                   a chip card that subsequently became the basis for Mastercard's chip card offering)

                   from 1996 to 2001, as director and subsequently Chairman of Mastercard Europay

                   UK Limited from 1990 to 1994, and as a director of Camelot, the national lottery,

                   between 2003 and 2005.


            7.     I was a director and later Chairman of the Employers' Forum on Disability Ltd from

                   1993 to 2007, a Trustee of the Royal Association for Disability Rights (RADAR) from

                   2004 to 2009, and Vice-President of Vitalise (now known as Revitalise) from 2005

                   to 2012. 1 am pleased with my work over the years advocating for people with

                   disabilities.


            8.     In early 2002 I was approached by executive search professionals who were

                   recruiting for the role of Chief Executive of POL. By that time, I was well-known for

                   my work with Midland Bank, HSBC and First Direct. I had two interviews with Post

                   Office and Royal Mail personnel — Allan Leighton, then Chairman of what is now

                   Royal Mail Group Limited ("RMG"), and John Roberts, then Chief Executive of RMG.

                   I was offered the position shortly after those interviews, and was pleased to accept

                   it. I was the Chief Executive of the Post Office from 15 April 2002 to 31 December

                   2005.


            MY TIME AT THE POST OFFICE


            9.     When I joined POL, it was technically insolvent. In the financial year ending 30

                   March 2003, POL made an operating loss of £369 million. As at that date, the

                   company had net liabilities of £936 million. It was entirely dependent on financial

                   support from its parent company, RMG, and ultimately from the UK government.


            10. In order to maintain its government financial support, POL was required to formulate,

                   present, agree with the UK government, and stick to, a business plan which would

                   ensure the transition of POL into an entity which was commercially viable in its own

                   right. This was made very clear by Patricia Hewitt MP (then-Secretary of State for




                                                             Page 30f40
                                                                                                     WITN10950100
                                                                                                   WITN10950100

                   Trade and Industry) on behalf of the government in writing to Mr Leighton and

                   communicated by him to me.


            11. POL had considerable resources at its disposal, including the largest retail branch

                   network in Europe (with circa 17,500 Post Office branches); huge regular customer

                   footfall (with 28 million customers making 45 million visits per week); and a brand

                   with an enormous amount of trust and importance placed on it by people across the

                   country. During my tenure, almost a quarter of cash changing hands in the UK was

                   going through our branches. In addition, it was lucky to have loyal and motivated

                   staff running its outlets. My job was to work with and supplement these resources,

                   among many others, and create a profitable business.


            12. As well as the overriding objective to make the company profitable, I was also

                   conscious of my other obligations as Chief Executive and as a director of POL.

                   Although directors' duties had not yet been codified by the Companies Act 2006,

                   was throughout conscious of my duty as a director to ensure that the company was

                   run in an honest, effective, and ethical manner. I understood that I had a fiduciary

                   responsibility as a director, and that I was required by law to use my directors'

                   powers to act in the best interests of the company, rather than for any improper

                   purpose. Further, I understood that my duties were not only owed to existing

                   shareholders, but also to the wider organisation, including POL's employees, and to

                   ensure it had a viable future.

            13. In addition, as the company (and group) was then solely owned by the state, I

                   considered the imperative to make the company profitable even more pressing. The

                   state ownership of the company also meant that executives at the company were

                   taking instructions from members of the government.              Direct government

                   instructions during my time at POL included setting strategic plan objectives for the

                   business centred around reducing overheads and ensuring commercial viability

                   across the network, and aligning directors' compensation with the delivery of the

                   strategic plan. It was clear that not following instructions from the government could

                   put one's position at POL at risk.


            14_    When I joined POL, I was barely briefed on anything, by anyone_ Even the building

                   security team was not expecting me on my first day — I arrived to an empty open-

                   plan office, and began work. I expected a full induction programme and/or a

                   handover document with a comprehensive list of current risks and issues (as

                   presently expected within the Financial Conduct Authority's Senior Managers and

                   Certification Regime), but this was not forthcoming.


            15. My initial priority when I started at POL, after gaining an understanding of the

                   business, was to formulate a strategic plan.


            16. 1 was aware at all times of the imperative to make POL profitable. This was made

                   clear to me at the start of my tenure, both by way of a letter from Mr Leighton

                   (Chairman of RMG) to whom I reported and from various sources internally. Later

DocuSign Envelope ID: 9AEAA600-AB62-4C6A-AD3E-660244DE84F9




                   in my tenure I became conscious that there was a drive to privatise RMG, and that

                   POL's astonishing losses were a significant barrier to that objective.


            17. Throughout my time as Chief Executive I reported intermittently to HM Treasury. In

                   my first four months in the job, I met with Ms Shriti Vadera (now Baroness Vadera),

                   who was an economic adviser to HM Treasury at that time. Ms Vadera was

                   impatient to see a new strategic plan for the business, which I was unable to

                   construct as quickly as she required. It was not until I understood this huge and

                   complex loss-making business, that no one had been able to make profitable, that

                   felt confident enough to create a plan to profitability.


            18. As POL became more successful and profitable throughout my tenure, the pressure

                   from HM Treasury waned.


            19. Over my tenure, to my recollection I had six to eight meetings with other government

                   officials, who were from HM Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry

                   (the "DTI"). During those meetings, we discussed issues of the day and the financial

                   progress of POL. In March 2005, for example, we held a stakeholder offsite meeting

                   with HM Treasury, the DTI, PostComm and PostWatch (see POL00021487).


            20. Also, from time to time, I met with a special advisor from the office of the Prime

                   Minister, Geoffrey Norris, and some ministers, for example Alan Johnson at the

                   suggestion of John Roberts.

            21. At the beginning of my tenure, POL did not hold regular board meetings. The only

                   directorship roles that existed at that time were Chief Executive, Chairman,

                   Executive Director of Operations and Finance Director. Building a proper board

                   structure was a high priority and an area of keen focus for me. I introduced

                   directorship roles for IT, sales and marketing, and HR. These roles were filled in

                   September 2002 by individuals within POL who I considered fit for directorship,

                   except for the sales and marketing role, which was filled by Gordon Steele, who was

                   recruited from outside POL.


            22. Once I had put together the group of executive directors at POL who would report

                   directly to me, I set up one-on-one meetings with each of them, which were initially

                   weekly and latterly monthly. In each of those meetings I would start by asking them

                   four questions: What are your top three priorities?         What are your top three

                   problems? Who are your top three people? And who are your bottom three people?

                   This allowed me to review their priorities (and to redirect them if necessary), to assist

                   as best I could with their problems, and to consider what we needed to do about

                   their best and worst people.


            23. The people I met with included each of the executive directors of POL, namely:

                   David Miller, Executive Director of Operations; John Main, HR Director (and later

                   Ian Anderson, his successor); Alan Barrie, Information Technology Director (and

                   later Ric Francis, his successor); Gordon Steele, Sales and Marketing Director;

                   Peter Corbett, Finance Director; and Graham Halliday, Executive Director of

                                                                                                   WITN10950100

                   Banking & Financial Services. I also met regularly with Byron Roberts, who was in

                   charge of cash handling and distribution (and subsequently became Programme

                   Director of Crown Office Strategy).


            24. From around September 2002 until the end of that year, I met with each of the

                   executive directors weekly. Thereafter, the meetings occurred on a monthly basis

                   until I left POL in 2006. At no time in any of those meetings did anyone raise an

                   issue of Horizon being claimed to be causing shortfalls in post office accounts, or

                   any link between Horizon and the investigation and prosecution of sub-postmasters

                   ("SPMs").


            25. Focusing upon the Horizon IT system, I knew and had been told very little about the

                   Horizon IT system at the time of joining. I knew that the system was delivered quite

                   some time before my arrival and that it was a complex system, which had been

                   originally developed for the Benefits Agency and subsequently made to 'fit' a

                   comprehensive back-office automation of the branch network. Upon commencing

                   employment as Chief Executive I received no overview, briefing, or any training

                   regarding the system. I was not aware of any bugs, errors, or defects in Horizon, or

                   related complaints.


            26. For the first six months of my tenure, I visited SPMs in their branches approximately

                   once a week. I wanted to introduce myself to the network as the new Chief

                   Executive, and the Post Office would encourage local press and councillors to attend

                   intended it would be), I wanted to gain a first-hand understanding from the SPMs of

                   how their businesses were working on a day-to-day basis, and how we could

                   improve upon them.


            27. The executive team and I continued to meet with SPMs throughout my tenure. In

                   2005 for example, the executive team between them attended over 500 events

                   communicating face-to-face to 1,800 managers and colleagues, and 15,000 SPMs

                   (see POL00021487).           In April 2005 we also held an offsite with the National

                   Federation of SubPostmasters (the "NFSP"), which included POL's Executive

                   Committee and NFSP executives, and made a detailed presentation to the NFSP

                   annual conference (see POL00021487)_


            28. Whilst I was under pressure both internally and externally to devise a business plan

                   for POL, it took 6 months of focused effort to understand the business of POL and

                   to devise a deliverable plan which would eliminate losses and turn it into profit.


            29. Throughout my tenure, I scheduled monthly meetings with Mr Leighton, Chairman

                   of RMG (POL's then parent company), who also in the early days of my tenure

                   attended POL board meetings.


            30. In those meetings I reported to Mr Leighton on essential updates and developments

                   occurring within POL and progress upon the Secretary of State's directives. They

                   followed a structure similar to my meetings with the POL directors: top three

                   priorities, top three problems, top three people, and bottom three people. Each

                   meeting was documented on agenda sheets, outlining action items to be taken

                   thereafter and by whom. I brought the practice of using agenda sheets into POL as

                   part of my ongoing efforts to instil organisation and accountability, having

                   successfully used them during my tenure in senior management at Midland

                   Bank/HSBC.


            31. Whilst POL in 2002 had the largest retail network in Europe, more branches than

                   the biggest UK banks and building societies combined, and some 45 million

                   customer visits to branches per week, it had no profitable products. It largely

                   provided services in respect of loss-making government distressed purchases such

                   as passports and driving licences and Royal Mail items such as letters or parcels,

                   which produced little by way of profitable return. POL didn't have any commercially

                   desirable products of its own.


            32. I came to understand, during my assessment of the potential for turning the business

                   around, that the way to make POL profitable was to sell POL products to its existing

                   customer base. Visitors to the Post Office were so many in number that even a

                   product with a very small margin, if well-designed and useful enough, and marketed

                   properly, could turn around the business. I therefore set about trying to improve

                   POL's product range.


            33. Because the business of POL was evolving throughout my time as Chief Executive,

                   I was very conscious of the importance of keeping staff, and particularly SPMs,

                   abreast of new product lines and other developments in the business. They were

                   our front line, and I wanted to make sure that they had the knowledge and tools that

                   they needed to sell our products effectively.


            34. Accordingly, throughout my tenure as Chief Executive, I regularly spent time

                   travelling the country and presenting to SPMs. Those presentations would be

                   focused on the new products we were asking them to sell, and what was in it for

                   them, as well as updating them on the overall state of the business.


            35. My responsibilities at POL were wide-ranging, and the workload was heavy. I would

                   start work at 6:30am with an hour of reading whilst travelling to the office. I was in

                   the office at 7.30am and would not leave until 6.30pm (often attending business

                   dinners in addition). I was committed to making POL a success.


            36. Under my stewardship, the Post Office became a hub for banking services for every

                   retail bank. I fostered an arrangement whereby customers of any high street bank

                   could withdraw cash, cash cheques and also pay into their own accounts. POL took

                   a fee from the banks for such transactions. The conversations and negotiations

                   leading to these deals with banks relied heavily on my ability to speak to people at

                   the right level, and being able to understand the intricacies of each necessary

                   agreement, in respect of every bank we connected with. While banks were closing

                   branches and removing ATMs, the Post Office remained on every high street as a

                   point of access for banking customers of all stripes. This was to become a key part

                   of its business going forward.

            37. We also introduced banking services in the name of the Post Office itself. For

                   instance, we introduced a basic bank account with limited functions which was

                   intended to be sold to those who were previously unbanked.


            38. Whilst successful in their own right, I understood that the individual agreements with

                   high street banks and the provision of cash withdrawal services alone were not

                   enough to turn the business around_ In order to further build these products,

                   decided to search for a bank whose product and administration facilities were good

                   enough for the Post Office to use. I approached most of the UK clearing banks and

                   eventually negotiated and spearheaded a deal with the Bank of Ireland (the "Bol"),

                   whereby the Post Office would sell Bol products in branches, under Post Office

                   branding.      This was a deal that I led personally and accomplishing the final

                   agreement took a great deal of time and energy. My long history in banking allowed

                   POL to be taken seriously by those senior officers who were responsible for

                   delivering the deal within Bol. This agreement in turn gave Bol access to POL's

                   incredible network coverage and footfall. This project was an intense focus for me

                   in my time at POL.


            39. Having secured the agreement with Bol, they paid the Post Office £125 million for

                   access to the branch network. The products available as a result of the agreement

                   included a wide range of things, such as personal loans and foreign money. The

                   Bol deal was a huge injection of cash to POL, which was critically needed. The deal

                   was announced in October 2003, and went into operation at the start of 2004.

            40. Much of our product strategy was focused on providing simple ways through

                   important matters. For instance, the Post Office's passport checking service is

                   valuable to consumers because it provides an easy and reliable way to renew a

                   passport. It a►so gave post offices the ideal opportunity to sell foreign exchange,

                   which became one of the most profitable product lines in the business. By the time

                   I left POL, the Post Office was the largest foreign exchange distributor and dealer in

                   the UK.


            41. During my tenure we also had franchise discussions with Tesco, Sainbury's, Marks

                   & Spencer, Budgens, Somerfield, WHSmith, Woolworths, and Wilkinsons (see

                   POL00021487)_


            42. I have been asked whether I personally reported to the Department of Trade and

                   Industry. I did not. This was a role fulfilled by Mr Miller and Ms Sue Huggins (who

                   was in charge of the program to close 2,500 Post Office branches) at the operational

                   level, and Sir Michael Hodgkinson and Mr Leighton at board level.


            43. Because the DTI was not exercising its oversight through me, it is difficult for me to

                   say whether its oversight was adequate.


            44. I reported to Mr Leighton at RMG throughout my tenure, but was required to report

                   to HM Treasury less frequently as the business became profitable.

            45. As well as being Chief Executive of POL, I also took on the following roles in the

                   RMG group:


                                a.   Director, Royal Mail Group plc


                                b.   Director, Royal Mail Holdings plc


                                c.   Director, Royal Mail Enterprises Limited


                                d.   Chairman, Post Office Financial Services Limited


                                e.   Director, Camelot Group plc


                                f.   Director, Camelot International Services Limited


                                g.   Chairman, First Rate Travel Services Limited


                                h.   Director, First Rate Travel Services Holdings Limited


                                i.   Director, Postal Heritage Services Limited


                                j.   Director, Postal Heritage Trust; and


                                k.   Director, Postal Heritage Collection Trust.


            46. When I joined POL, it was a subsidiary of RMG, which was in turn a subsidiary of

                   Royal Mail Holdings plc ("RM Holdings"), which was wholly owned by the state.


            47. This corporate structure did not change throughout my time at POL.

            48. As I say above, during my tenure POL operated as a subsidiary organisation to

                   RMG. Many decisions affecting POL were made by RMG. Especially when I joined

                   but throughout my tenure, I felt that the exact relationship between POL and RMG

                   was unclear. This made it difficult for me to manage POL. For example, with

                   hindsight, the legal function should have been reporting to me on matters related to

                   POL, so that I could exercise oversight over it. It was not, as I explain below.


            49. When I joined POL, I was the only representative from POL on the board of RMG.

                   After we appointed a POL Chairman, he too joined the RMG board.


            50. As I note above, I reported to Mr Leighton throughout my tenure at POL. After Sir

                   Michael Hodgkinson, who was the senior independent director at RMG, was

                   appointed as Chairman of POL, he also reported to Mr Leighton. Sir Michael

                   Hodgkinson and I would meet with Mr Leighton separately.


            51. I believe that it is important to differentiate between matters relating to POL and

                   those relating to RMG. An example of this importance and now one of significance

                   was that departments such as Legal and helpdesks/call centres reported to

                   individuals in RMG rather that POL.


            THE POL BOARD


            52. As I note above, when I joined POL, there were irregular board meetings. On arrival

                   at POL, the board was therefore not exercising proper or effective oversight of any

                   function.

                                                                                                WITN10950100

DocuSign Envelope ID: 9AEAA600-AB62-4C6A-AD3E-660244DE84F9




            53. I therefore instituted a program to ensure that the board met formally bi-monthly,

                   with formal executive meetings on the intervening months. Further, every Monday

                   morning at 9am, there was a meeting called of all the directors during which they

                   were expected to provide individual reports on what had happened since the last

                   meeting and what was on their agenda for the coming week.


            54. In general, POL behaved (at that time especially, but throughout my tenure) as the

                   board of a subsidiary organisation, with RMG as the dominant entity.


            55. An illustrative example of this was when I wanted to introduce personal loans as a

                   POL product. I advised the RMG board, and a director who held a senior role at a

                   big American bank was averse to my proposal. His resistance held a great deal of

                   sway with the RMG board, and almost resulted in the activity being rejected.

                   Personal loans eventually ended up being a highly profitable product for POL and

                   the SPMs.


            56. As above, I instituted bi-monthly board meetings, and more often when business

                   need demanded it. All executive directors attended, together with the Company

                   Secretary, who was also Company Secretary to RMG, and all relevant senior staff

                   as needed subject to the agenda. Later, the Chairman and non-executive director

                   would also attend.

            57. The agenda for board meetings was determined by Mr Jonathan Evans acting as

                   Company Secretary, which would be shown to me for my agreement. At the board

                   meetings, we would review and consider documents including:


                                 a. The minutes of the previous board meeting;


                                 b_ The status report of the previous board meeting, which would be put

                                     together after meetings by the Company Secretary, Mr Evans, to

                                     track the actions agreed at each meeting and who was responsible

                                     for each (an example is at POL00095503);


                                 c. Functional Reports on finance, operations, sales & marketing; and


                                 d. Business plans and presentations on matters such as the provision

                                     of new products.


            58. The POL board was involving, straightforward and accountable. At POL board

                   meetings, I actively sought reports and contributions from every attendee. My view

                   was that they were not attending for the sake of it — they were there to report to me

                   and to the wider POL board on developments and issues in their area of authority.

                   In addition to each executive director reporting upon his activity, there was a

                   concentration among the board upon the financial progress of the company.

            59. The POL board operated collegiately with the RMG board: they were not

                   competitive, and they tried to help each other. Notwithstanding this, generally RMG

                   had the final say.


            60. I was not on any sub-committees of the POL board and I do not recall any board

                   sub-committees other than the Risk and Compliance Committee, which was chaired

                   by the POL Chairman, Sir Michael Hodgkinson_ Beyond this, I do not recall the

                   background to its creation or its remit.


            61. I do not recall the membership or terms of reference of any other POL board sub-

                   committees.


            62. The POL board underwent a change in structure in May 2003 with the appointment

                   of Sir Michael Hodgkinson as Chairman, and again in February 2005 with the

                   appointment of Alan Cook as non-executive director. I recall having one discussion

                   with Mr Leighton concerning the suitability of Mr Cook as a non-executive director.

                   I was not involved in any discussions concerning the appointment of Sir Michael

                   Hodgkinson. I believe that their appointments were considered necessary by Mr

                   Leighton because he had been instructed by Ms P Hewitt at the DTI to make them.


            63. The level of technical IT expertise of most members of the POL board was not high.

                   However, the IT Director (Alan Barrie and later Ric Francis) would of course have

                   been expected to aid the board with their expertise, as needed.

            64. If any of the executive management team did not attend board meetings, their

                   reporting activity would be delegated to a deputy.


            65. I have been asked to address my view of the responsibilities of the board of directors

                   in respect of oversight of particular company issues. My views on the POL board,

                   and its oversight of POL matters specifically, are as follows:


                                 a. Oversight of criminal prosecutions in the name of the company. It is

                                     unusual for a company to be directly involved in criminal

                                     prosecutions. Throughout my career I had no experience of any

                                     company for whom I worked bringing prosecutions in their own right.

                                     In so far as I had gained any awareness of corporate involvement in

                                     prosecutions it was confined to knowing that, for instance, a bank

                                     would work closely with law enforcement agencies as and when

                                     requested and required. Dealing with my time at POL, I would have

                                     expected prosecution decisions to be overseen and taken by the

                                     legal department, with the board having close and regular oversight

                                     through the Audit Committee of any unusual matters or significant

                                     issues escalated by legal team leaders. If matters relating to criminal

                                     prosecutions in the name of POL had been escalated to the POL

                                     board, we would have paid them close attention. Such matters never

                                     reached the POL board or the RMG board, so far as I am aware.

                                 b. Oversight of civil litigation brought by or against the company. In a

                                     company the size of POL, I would have expected oversight to be

                                     delegated to an executive such as Mr Evans, the Company

                                     Secretary, with responsibility to report to the board as appropriate.

                                     So far as I am aware, matters of civil litigation never reached the POL

                                     board or the RMG board.


                                 c. Oversight of the company's IT. The IT function of the company

                                     should report to a director, who reports regularly to the Chief

                                     Executive and thence to the board, particularly on any key issues.

                                     This was why I introduced the role of IT Director at the POL board

                                     level.


                                 d. Oversight of any accounting system the company used to collate

                                     individual transactions, cash and stock declarations etc used for the

                                     purposes of preparing management and statutory accounts. This

                                     matter should be the responsibility of the Finance Director, supported

                                     by the IT Director, with support and verification by independent

                                     external auditors.


                                 e. Oversight of the company's compliance with the Race Relations Act

                                     1978. All directors should ensure that the company acts within the

                                     law of the land.

            THE RMG BOARD


            66. The RMG board met monthly throughout my time at POL_ I believe the agenda was

                   determined by the Chairman, Mr Leighton, and the Company Secretary, Mr Evans.


            67. RMG board meetings were attended by all directors and the Company Secretary,

                   and in addition were frequently attended by up to six selected RMG executives. As

                   with the POL board, the leadership style of the RMG was collegiate.


            68. My limited recollection of the board's sub-committees comprises the Audit

                   Committee, the Remunerations Committee and, I think, a Risk and Compliance

                   Committee. I was not on any of these committees, nor do I know their membership

                   or terms of reference.


            69. To my recollection, reports that would be regularly submitted to RMG board

                   meetings included the RMG CEO's report, trading statements, capital expenditure

                   requests and regulatory updates.


            70. I do not know the level of IT expertise of those who attended the RMG board.


            LEGAL DEPARTMENT


            71. To the best of my recollection and understanding, the legal department that dealt

                   with all civil and criminal legal matters associated with POL or RMG was run by

                   RMG. In any event, the legal department did not report to me.

                                                                                                    WITN10950100

DocuSign Envelope ID: 9AEAA600-AB62-4C6A-AD3E-660244DE84F9




            72. I recall that heading the legal department was Catherine Churchard. It was my

                   understanding at the time that Ms Churchard acted in a capacity similar to that of

                   general counsel to RMG. My recollection is that Ms Churchard was employed by

                   RMG and reported to Mr Evans. Mr Evans was Company Secretary of both POL

                   and RMG, but de facto reported to Mr Leighton - he did not report to me.


            73. Although matters related to Legal were not regular agenda items at POL board

                   meetings, they would be discussed if required. To my recollection, the POL board

                   did not discuss matters relating to fraud or errors in Horizon's accounting system. I

                   do not recall any specific legal matters being discussed in POL board meetings.


            74. I was not involved in oversight of the legal department.


            INVESTIGATIONS DEPARTMENT


            75. My recollection of the investigations department was that it was primarily the remit

                   of RMG, and that the investigations team (who were employed by RMG) reported to

                   someone in RMG. They did not report to me.


            76. As with legal matters, investigations matters were not typical agenda items at POL

                   board meetings. Should any concerns over these matters have risen to POL director

                   level, I would have expected them to have been reported to me by either Mr Corbett,

                   who was Finance Director, or by Mr Miller, who was COO. In this connection, my

                   oversight of POL investigations was limited by communication of any issues by the

                   executive directors to me. To my recollection, no concerns were ever raised.

            77. 1 was not involved in oversight of the RMG investigations department.


            SECURITY DEPARTMENT


            78. My understanding of the security function of RMG and POL was that it was

                   responsible for overseeing the physical security of post offices and monitoring the

                   criminal misuse of the postal system. As with legal and investigations, security was

                   not a typical board meeting agenda item, and therefore my oversight of it was reliant

                   on the reporting of issues to me.


            79. The POL security team was headed by Tony Marsh. Mr Marsh did not report directly

                   or indirectly to me in POL (although, as shown in the minutes of the POL board

                   meeting of 20 August 2003 (POL00021483), Mr Marsh did, on at least one occasion,

                   report to the POL board on matters of security at a high level).


            80. I have been asked whether in the meeting of 20 August 2003 the POL board

                   discussed the prosecution of SPMs for theft or false accounting arising from alleged

                   shortfalls in branch accounts.              To the best of my recollection, we did not.

                   Accordingly, we did not consider the reliability of Horizon data in that meeting.


            81. I had a very limited professional relationship with Mr Marsh. I do not know who Mr

                   Marsh would report to on matters of security but my limited recollection is that the

                   reporting line was to RMG, not POL.

DocuSign Envelope ID: 9AEAA600-AB62-4C6A-AD3E-660244DE84F9




            82. As the legal and investigations teams at POL did not report to me, I did not have

                   any oversight of (i) the investigation and prosecution of SPMs for theft, fraud and

                   false accounting for alleged shortfalls in branch accounts, or (ii) the pursuit of SPMs

                   for the recovery of alleged shortfalls in branch accounts, including through the use

                   of civil proceedings.


            83. While I was not specifically aware of prosecutions or civil proceedings undertaken

                   by POL against SPMs, it is important to reiterate that POL comprised 65,000 people

                   across 17,500 branches, and I would therefore have expected there to be at least

                   some level of legal activity in connection with SPMs. My expectation as Chief

                   Executive was that anything particularly unusual or concerning in nature would rise

                   to the board through either the Audit Committee or the Risk and Compliance

                   Committee. I would not have expected the board to have had oversight of every

                   legal action taken. However, no such matters arose, and therefore I was not aware

                   of any details regarding investigations, prosecutions and civil actions against SPMs.


            84. I was not (and even now am not) aware of any of the following:


                                 a. The policies, guidelines and practices followed by POL or RMG when

                                     pursuing a civil action against an SPM;


                                 b. The conduct of audits of SPMs' branch accounts;


                                 c. The practices and policies POL adopted in respect of suspending or

                                     terminating SPMs' contracts; or

                                     investigating alleged offences and bringing criminal prosecutions,

                                     including the process of disclosing documents_


            85. Even with hindsight and the general knowledge acquired from the many media

                   reports of recent times, I am unable to assist on the propriety of POL's approach to

                   prosecutions and the disclosure of information to SPMs convicted on the basis of

                   Horizon data. I simply do not have enough knowledge of those processes to

            IT DEPARTMENT


            86. When I joined POL, Mr Alan Barrie was the IT Director of POL. He left his role

                   around the end of 2003, and was replaced by Mr Ric Francis, who I recruited.


            87. As Chief Executive, the POL IT Director reported to me. Issues with Horizon and

                   Fujitsu should therefore have been, and I would have expected them to be, reported

                   to me. Along with other members of the POL Board, I was unable to exercise the

                   oversight I would have liked of those issues because they were not reported up to

                   me.


            88. I was not involved in oversight of the RMG IT department, except as a director of

                   RMG.


            THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM

            89. My involvement with Horizon was very limited. The little I understand of it is set out

                   herein.


            90. Horizon was a system that was built to deliver state benefits via the Post Office.

                   When the Benefits Agency decided not to use the system any longer in the spring

                   of 1999, it was repurposed as a way to automate the entire back office of the branch

                   network.


            91. With hindsight, Horizon should not have been repurposed in that way. It has

                   become evident that it was not fit for purpose. It should have been written off, and

                   a different approach adopted_


            92. When I took up my role at POL in 2002, the system was there, tested, accepted,

                   and had been operating for some years. Horizon had already been implemented in

                   totality.


            93. As I set out above, I was not given any briefing or training on Horizon when I joined

                   POL. Originally, I increased my knowledge of Horizon by discussing its efficacy with

                   users. When I visited the SPMs in their branches during the first six months of my

                   tenure, I tried to understand how practical and easy Horizon was to use. Some

                   SPMs were pleased with the system, which improved their daily lives, however

                   others found weekly balancing more difficult and time consuming. I thought that

                   more training was required, which was implemented, and I simultaneously

                                                                                                      WITN10950100

DocuSign Envelope ID: 9AEAA600-AB62-4C6A-AD3E-660244DE84F9




                   endeavoured to improve the process by studying it more closely in a `model office'

                   designed to give insight into what was actually happening.


            94. As a general point, from my perspective it was inconceivable (at any stage during

                   my tenure) that POL would replace Horizon. The focus was therefore on trying to

                   negotiate with Fujitsu to improve the terms of the contract and to try to make

                   continuous improvements in Horizon's performance, my particular focus being cost

                   and the delivery of new products. I was aware that the reason Horizon was

                   repurposed from the Benefits Agency software was because, otherwise, it would

                   have had to have been written off. That would have been an enormous bottom-line

                   hit.


            95. Horizon was in my opinion very expensive. My view was that the POL team that

                   had negotiated the original Horizon contract hadn't had a reasonable idea what the

                   cost of such a system should be. Given that I was not informed of issues with

                   reliability of Horizon's data, the cost of the system was one of my foremost concerns

                   about the contract.


            96. I was conscious of, and encouraged, efforts to reduce the costs of the Horizon

                   contract. This was part of the overarching mission, shared by everyone at POL, to

                   make the business profitable. For instance, in the minutes of the POL Board

                   meeting of 23 February 2005 (POL00021487), it is recorded that the POL Board

                   discussed "the strategy being pursued for the development of the Next Generation

                   of Horizon". It was noted in particular that "a 30% reduction in IT costs would be

                   required by 2008. This would be a key enabler for Post Office Ltd to meet its Rural

                   and Directly Managed saving targets".


            The Horizon contract and relations with Fujitsu


            97. 1 dealt with Fujitsu very little during my time at POL.


            98. When I started in my role at POL, I had no briefing on the contract between POL

                   and Fujitsu, and was never in fact briefed on that contract. I was not aware of any

                   of the particular contractual documents of which it consisted, including the Second

                   Supplement Agreement (POL00090428) or the Third Supplemental Agreement

                   (FUJ00118186), or any specific provisions therein. Alan Barrie was technically in

                   charge of negotiations, but to the best of my recollection he delegated this

                   responsibility to Keith Baines and a partner at Slaughter and May.


            99. I was not involved in any discussions or negotiations regarding POL's access to so-

                   called ARQ data, or audit data, for the purposes of criminal investigation and

                   prosecutions.


            Documents concerning the extension of the Horizon contract to 2005


            100. I have reviewed documents RMG00000194, a memo I wrote on 7 August 2002

                   concerning a call with Mr Richard Christou, then Chief Executive of Fujitsu, and

                   RMG00000079, a December 2002 paper on the extension and amendment of the

                   Horizon contract (the "December 2002 Paper")

DocuSign Envelope ID: 9AEAA600-AB62-4C6A-AD3E-660244DE84F9




            101. I was not involved in negotiations with Fujitsu as to the extension of the Horizon

                   contract. It appears that Mr Christou rang me on 7 August 2002 as an exceptional

                   step, to discuss the course of the negotiations.


            102. I accept that my name is on the December 2002 Paper, the content of which I did

                   not write. It would have emanated from the POL IT function and been written by the

                   team negotiating with Fujitsu, probably headed by Keith Baines on behalf of Alan

                   Barrie. I regret that I therefore cannot answer the Inquiry's questions regarding the

                   content of this document and that I was not involved in any discussions or

                   negotiation regarding POL's access to ARQ or audit data for the purposes of criminal

                   investigations and prosecutions. At present I am having difficulty with understanding

                   why my name is on the document as I have no recollection of it.


            103. I would expect examination of the original digital file of the December 2002 Paper to

                   be instructive as to who in fact wrote the memo. I made a request to the Inquiry for

                   access to the original (for the purpose of examining its metadata). I understand from

                   the response to my request that the original file is not available, which is unfortunate.

                   I also made requests to each of the Inquiry, POL, and RMG for the board minutes

                   of the RMG meeting at which the memo was discussed. None of those parties were

                   able to provide those board minutes.


            Concerns about the reliability of Horizon data

            104. I do not recall being made aware of any concerns as to the reliability of data

                   produced by Horizon. To the best of my recollection, no such concerns were

                   discussed by either the POL or RMG boards.


            105. As such, I did not pass on any information on such concerns to any other individuals,

                   and did not manage or arrange the distribution of such information within POL.


            The Horizon s90 release


            106. I was not involved in the Horizon s90 release, which I understand to have been a

                   software update released in March 2006. As noted above, I left POL at the end of

                   2005. In my role, I was not involved in software development, even in a managerial

                   capacity.


            107. I have reviewed document POL00028984, an email chain beginning on 11 January

                   2006, regarding a software "quirk' that was affecting branches including the branch

                   known as `Callendar Square', and the fix that was expected to be provided by the

                   s90 release.


            108. I was not aware of the matters raised in this email while I was employed by POL. I

                   had not heard of the so-called `Callendar Square bug' until recent news coverage.


            Horizon Online


            109. I was not involved with the negotiation of, or preparation for, the Horizon Online

                   contract.

            PROBLEM MANAGEMENT TEAM


            110_ I did not come across either the POL or RMG `Problem Management Team' during

                   my time at POL. Neither of these reported to me.


            THE CLEVELEYS CASE


            111. I have reviewed document POL00158493, which is an email from Mr Baines to me

                   regarding a risk in the IT risk register related to the civil proceedings against Ms

                   Wolstenholme (the "Cleveleys Case")


            112. I was not involved in the Cleveleys Case. I did not give any instructions in respect

                   of the case, or brief others on the board about the case.


            113. I do not recall asking the question which Mr Baines responds to in this email.

                   However, it does not surprise me that I would have asked that kind of question,

                   having seen such a risk on the risk register.


            114. I do not recall any follow-up or steps taken in response to Mr Baines' email to me.


            115. I was not aware of and did not read the advice of Mr Brochwicz-Lewinski dated 26

                   July 2004. Neither was I aware of nor read the report of Jason Coyne. Accordingly,

                   I took no steps in relation to the concerns set out in that report.

            116. Nothing about the Cleveleys Case struck me as exceptional or unusual at that time.

                   Given my extremely limited knowledge of the case, it did not lead me to reflect on

                   POL's conduct in pursuing shortfalls or prosecuting SPMs at that time.


            COMPLAINTS BY SPMS


            117. I have reviewed document POL00072892, which is a letter from Mr Lee Castleton

                   to Mr Knight dated 6 December 2004, to which I am copied.


            118. I do not recall seeing this letter. I did not open my own post in general while I was

                   at POL. If I had seen it, I would have asked Mr Miller, Executive Director of

                   Operations at POL, to follow up with Mr Knight.


            119. I have also reviewed document POL00107373, a letter from Simon Burns MP

                   addressed to me dated 21 November 2005. The letter explains the circumstances

                   of a SPM named Mr A Bajaj, who had been experiencing shortfalls in his Horizon

                   accounts and had personally made multiple contributions to cover those shortfalls.

                   It encloses part of an account of those circumstances by Mr Bajaj himself.


            120. I do not recall seeing this letter. I resigned from my role at POL in late 2005, and

                   agreed a severance agreement with RMG which was dated 11 November 2005 (the

                   "Severance Agreement").              Although the exact date on which this letter was

                   received by POL is not clear, its date of sending is after I had signed the Severance

                   Agreement with RMG and shortly before the date that my employment formally

                   ended, which was 31 December 2005. Given this timing, I do not believe that I

                   would have been the person monitoring such correspondence. The RMG and POL

                   boards at the time were aware that I had stepped back from such responsibilities.


            121. To provide further context, for at least two weeks before I signed the Severance

                   Agreement, I was in tense negotiations with RMG regarding my departure from POL.

                   As I elaborate on further below, I had decided to resign from POL due to my

                   dissatisfaction with RMG's management. Very quickly my negotiations with RMG

                   became acrimonious and, for those weeks, they took up most of my focus.


            122. By the time I had agreed and signed the Severance Agreement, RMG and I had

                   come to a mutual understanding that I would thereafter focus my efforts on

                   searching for new employment. This understanding is evident in the terms of the

                   Severance Agreement. For example, it was agreed in the Severance Agreement

                   that RMG would engage Stork & May, a career advisory firm for senior executives,

                   to assist me with finding a new role. I had my first meeting with recruitment

                   professionals on 3 November 2005 and discussions continued from there. Between

                   3 November and the formal end of my employment, I had around thirty meetings

                   with individuals across the market to help consider my next role.


            123_ It is for this reason, I believe, that I regretfully did not see the letter from Simon Burns

                   MP. By the time the letter was written I was in the process of leaving POL. Had I

                   seen it, I would have wanted to investigate the position immediately, particularly

                   because Mr Bajay's account was convincing and was supported by his MP.

            124. I have been asked whether I was concerned by the nature or frequency of

                   allegations made by SPMs that Horizon was defective. To be clear, whilst at POL

                   was not made aware of complaints to the effect that Horizon was compromised. I

                   could not therefore be concerned by the nature or frequency of allegations made by

                   SPMs that Horizon was defective. I wish to state that had I been aware of such a

                   situation I would have acted to investigate and remedy such complaints.


            125. Each of these letters should have been followed up by the appropriate POL or RMG

                   personnel, whether that would have been me or some other senior executive. That

                   would have been clear at the time, but with hindsight it is now obvious.


            126. I understand that, as Chief Executive of POL, it is expected of me by the Inquiry and

                   by the public that I should have known about the faults inherent to the Horizon

                   system and the subsequent wrongful prosecution and conviction of SPMs that

                   occurred during my tenure. It is with great regret and humility that I apologise that I

                   did not. I am particularly sorry that I did not see Simon Burns MP's letter about the

                   distressing circumstances of Mr Bajaj. If I had, I am certain that I would have

                   actioned an investigation into those circumstances but, regretfully, the letter was

                   written and (presumably) received during a period in which I was no longer active

                   as POL's Chief Executive.


            IMPACT PROGRAMME

            127. I was not involved in the design or implementation of the IMPACT programme. As

                   per the board minutes dated 1 September 2004 (POL00032050), Mr Peter Corbett

                   was responsible for the programme's implementation.


            128. I do not recall any board decision being taken by the POL or RMG boards regarding

                   the fact that SPMs would no longer be able to place disputed discrepancies in a

                   local suspense account and roll into a new trading period as a result of the IMPACT

                   programme.


            MY DEPARTURE FROM THE POST OFFICE


            129. Ultimately, I left POL because I disagreed with the approach being taken by RMG

                   management to running it. My activity as Chief Executive of POL in turning the

                   business around, as briefly described above, had been accompanied in or around

                   August 2005 with the retention of the consultancy firm McKinsey, who were hired by

                   Mr Leighton to work on reducing POL's costs. One of McKinsey's tasks was to make

                   a recommendation on the optimal future structure and strategic direction of the




            130. My experience told me that management consultants tended to suggest one solution

                   above all others, which was to effect cost-cutting through headcount reductions,

                   which was the wrong diagnosis to solve POL's problems.


            131. Then, in the autumn of 2005, Mr Leighton informed me that he wanted to change

                   my reporting line from himself to Mr Adam Crozier, Chief Executive of RMG, who



                                                             Page 35 of 40
                                                                                                        WITN10950100
                                                                                                      WITN10950100

                   would then have been responsible for all of RMG and POL. It was therefore deemed

                   that Mr Crozier's prior background and experience in advertising at Saatchi &

                   Saatchi, and as the Chief Executive of the Football Association, qualified him to run

                   the biggest branch banking network in Europe, together with Royal Mail and

                   Parcelforce, all at once.


            132_ I had further discussion with Mr Leighton and resigned my position_


            133. For the avoidance of doubt, my departure had nothing at all to do with anything

                   related to Horizon or to the investigation and prosecution of SPMs.


            134. The Severance Agreement I signed after resigning from POL contained certain

                   restrictions on my ability to speak about RMG and its group companies.


            135. In anticipation of giving this evidence (and further evidence as required), I have

                   secured a waiver of those terms of the Severance Agreement which might have in

                   any way restricted my evidence to this Inquiry.


            136. After I left my role at POL, I retained external board roles for several more years.

                   These included being the senior independent director of a company owning the

                   biggest European ATM network, being Chairman of the UK's biggest house

                   conveyancer, and being a senior independent director helping venture capitalists to

                   recruit a high-level team to convert a failing building society into one of the most

                   successful `challenger banks' listed on AIM in UK. In 2014, aged 70, I retired in full,

                   and resigned from each of my extant roles.

            137. My passion for promoting the interests of disabled people led me to be involved with

                   government in formulating the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. This interest

                   continued throughout my time at POL and after my leaving. As mentioned above at

                   paragraph 6, having left POL I continued to devote a substantial amount of my time

                   and effort to promoting the rights and welfare of disabled people. I remained on the

                   board of the Employers' Forum on Disability Ltd, as Trustee of the Royal Association

                   for Disability Rights, and as Vice-President of Vitalise (now Revitalise).


            CLOSING REMARKS


            138. I was very conscious of the value and trust that people placed in the Post Office

                   during my tenure. In speeches to SPMs during my time at the Post Office, I regularly

                   cited statistics showing the Post Office to be one of the most trusted institutions in

                   the country. I was proud of the organisation I led and have been extremely anxious

                   and upset in more recent years as matters have unfolded and the true situation

                   regarding Horizon and its impact upon SPMs has been revealed.


            139. With hindsight, it is clear to see what should have happened in regard to the Horizon

                   system and the investigations and prosecutions undertaken in reliance on it. If I had

                   been made aware of the serious concerns as to Horizon's reliability, I would have

                   imposed an immediate moratorium on the use of Horizon evidence in civil and

                   criminal litigation against SPMs.

            140. 1 would also have called a halt to every new technical development project related

                   to Horizon, until the system was fit for purpose.


            141. In my opinion it would also have been essential for the Chairman of POL and the

                   Chairman of RMG to have advised the government at the highest level of the harm

                   foisted upon the SPMs, and to have sought the quashing of convictions which were

                   caused by the unreliability of the Horizon system and their speedy fulsome

                   compensation.
