1.0 Background

This document sets out the guidelines that govern the working relationship at the interface
between NBSC and HSH. It defines the customer and supplier responsibilities which both
POL and Fujitsu Services must undertake in order to support the delivery of incident
management to the Post Office network.

2.0 Intent of this Agreement
The intent of the agreement is to:

e Establish effective co-operation between NBSC and HSH in the delivery of incident
management to the Post Office network—

¢ Agree responsibilities and detail the interactions that must take place, between NBSC and
HSH to ensure the successful delivery of a seamless incident management service to the
Post Office network.

e Provide a recognised definition of the responsibilities of NBSC and HSH in respect of the
delivery of incident management to the Post Office network.

3.0 Scope

This document defines:

« How the NBSC and HSH will provide a seamless incident management service to Post
Office and agreed POL and Fujitsu Services Post Office Account support groups.

e The "grey" areas and associated responsibilities of each helpdesk with respect to those
incidents (detailed in appendix A).

e The way in which NBSC and HSH will co-operate when working together to manage the
resolution of complex incidents, where resolution responsibility is shared.

This document applies to the management of incidents, which occur during the everyday
operation by post office branch staff and support of the Horizon solution by POL and Fujitsu
Services Post Office Account support groups.

This document does not define or suggest how POL and Fujitsu Services Post Office Account
support groups will resolve incidents. Incident resolution is therefore beyond the scope of this
agreement.

The document defines an exceptional event as an event that may cause an increase in call
volume and/or is likely to impact the operation of the call management process. Under these
circumstances, direct communication will take place between HSH and NBSC. Regular
contact will be maintained i.e. hourly calls until the problem is resolved.

The specific areas described within this agreement are:

6.0 Responsibilities - Specific
7.0 6.1 NBSC

a) NBSC Team Leaders are responsible for informing HSH of any exceptional event within
30 mins (known issues or problems) or a trend spotted that may cause incidents to be
logged or increase call volumes. Communication of exceptional events is via a telephone
call direct to the HSH Duty Manager (appendix B of this document). The communications
should be maintained on an hourly basis until the incident is resolved.

b) NBSC agents will raise an incident in response to a FADCODE telephone call from HSH
giving the caller a unique incident number.

c) NBSC will accept incidents into their management domain in accordance with the
responsibility matrix detailed in appendix A. This rule is subject to two exceptions detailed
in paragraphs g) and j) below.

d) On acceptance of the incident NBSC will manage the incident in accordance with POL
incident management processes.

e) On acceptance of the incident by NBSC, HSH will close their incident. This closure occurs
because management of the incident has moved from the HSH management domain to the
NBSC management domain.

f) When NBSC receive an inappropriate call, NBSC are responsible for ensuring the caller is
redirected to the correct helpdesk. When a caller is redirected an incident will be logged
and immediately closed.

g) When NBSC receive a call for an incident redirected from HSH, and NBSC deem the call
to be inappropriate, the incident must be accepted and resolved where possible using the
knowledge database to address the issue.

h) If NBSC receive a complaint call about the HSH service or Horizon Solution the
complaint call must be logged and dealt with in accordance with the NBSC complaint
procedure (customer relations). If T1 is unable to resolve, the incident is transferred to the
Customer Relations team stack for resolution. Whenever possible impact on customer
performance must be considered and the advisor is empowered to resolve the incident as
appropriate.

i) If NBSC wish to raise a complaint against a HSH agent who they deem to have acted
inappropriately when transferring a call to them, an NBSC Team leader will notify a HSH
Team Manager. A complaint will be logged at HSH, investigated and feedback given to
NBSC.

j) The NBSC is responsible for co-operating fully with HSH in the resolution of complex
appropriate incidents. A complex appropriate incident is defined as “an incident that
requires both NBSC and HSH action to resolve the incident”.

k) The NBSC is responsible for accepting and logging ‘undefined incidents’. An ‘undefined
incident’ is an incident that applies to the NBSC or HSH Service or the Horizon solution,
but is not listed in appendix A. These incidents will be referred to the Team Leader or
Manager to address. In addition ‘undefined incidents’ will be referred to the NBSC/HSH

6.2 HSH

a) HSH Team Managers are responsible for informing NBSC of any exceptional event within
30 minutes, ( known issues or problems) or a trend spotted that may cause incidents to be
logged or increase call volumes. Communications of exceptional events is via a telephone
call direct to NBSC/team leader (appendix B of this document). The communications
should be maintained on an hourly basis until issue is resolved.

b) HSH will raise an incident in response to an authenticated telephone call from NBSC
giving the caller a unique incident number.

c) HSH will only accept incidents in to their management domain in accordance with the
responsibility matrix detailed in appendix A below. This rule is subject to two exceptions
detailed in paras g) and j) below.

d) On acceptance of the incident HSH will manage the incident in accordance with Fujitsu
Services Post Office Account incident management processes.

e) On acceptance of the incident by HSH, NBSC will close their incident. This closure occurs
because management of the incident has moved from the NBSC management domain to
the HSH management domain.

f) When HSH receive an inappropriate call (from the implementation of SPOC 2 this will be
anything that does not fall into the following categories: Hardware, Software, Outlet
Business Change, Emergency closure, Reference data, Implementation Network,
Operational, Non polling, Reconciliation, Security or Environmental, as defined in the
Horizon System Helpdesk Call Enquiry Matrix), HSH are responsible for ensuring the
caller is redirected to the correct helpdesk. When a caller is redirected an incident will be
logged and immediately closed.

g) When HSH receive a call for an incident redirected from NBSC and HSH deem that call to
be inappropriate the incident must be accepted and passed to team manager to address the
issue. From SPOC 2 if these calls cannot be coded under one of the categories listed in f
above, the call will be coded as inappropriate and answered if possible, the only exception
is business related incidents where the call will be transferred back to the NBSC.

incident, is an incident that is not listed in appendix A below. Such incidents will be
referred to the Team Manager to address. In addition undefined incidents will be referred

responsibility matrix at appendix A below. In this context the term undefined incidents
applies to, undefined incidents that relate to the NBSC Service, HSH Service or Horizon
solution.

1) Fujitsu Services Post Office Account will agree with HSH the content of messages on the

8.0 Process Models for HSH and NBSC Interaction

Four process diagrams are shown on the following pages. The first two relate to the HSH.
The third and fourth relate to the NBSC. The diagrams show the interfaces between the HSH
& NBSC and how those interfaces are expected to work in support of business as usual
activity.

The process diagrams include:

(a) an anti-call-bouncing link which prevents callers being passed backwards and forwards
between the two desks,

The process diagrams assume that:

(a) there is a well defined list of appropriate incidents for both desks, which accommodate
new unexpected incident types,

(b) The desk transferring an incident closes their incident when the other desk accepts the
transfer.

(c) The MIS systems associated with the NBSC and HSH will record the correct incident type
for incidents that are accepted via the anti-call-bouncing agreement.

(d) The performance of the anti- call bouncing agreement will be reviewed at the Helpdesk
Review forum to ensure the agreement does not impact on the contract

On the following four process diagrams only the sub-processes listed below relate directly to
this Interface Agreement. The other sub-processes shown on the diagrams and their
interactions are included for information purposes and may be subject to change solely at the
discretion of Fujitsu Services Post Office Account (sub-processes with prefix H) and Post
Office (sub-processes prefix N).

Processes relating directly to this interface agreement include:
H1, H5, H10, H11, H12, H13, H18, H19, H20, H21, H22, H23.
