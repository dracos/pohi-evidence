REGINA v JOSEPHINE HAMILTON

WINCHESTER CROWN COURT

TRIAL = 10™ SEPTEMBER 2007

CASE NO: POLTD/0506/0685

Further to my previous minute regarding the above please note that Counsel
requires the following statement.

1 A further statement from Allen as to why no extra training was given on
handover ie could she explain was this because the Defendant already
knew how the system worked to a good standard.

2 A further statement of Portch, this should set out how much cash she
would expect should be held at any one time at an Office similar to the
Defendants.

3 Could Portch or someone else give details of the extent of the offenders

training on Horizon, her handover, how it happened and what help /
training she got.

4 A further statement from Colin Woodridge regarding his conversation
about the shortfall of £1,500 in May 2003.

5 Could a statement be provided dealing with who is available if the
Defendant finds she is struggling ie dealing what help would be afforded
