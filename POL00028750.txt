lew evidence added - Messages produced when stock unit OOH was rolled a

JF) Response :

in fact the note "28/11/2000 17:42:42 - By Lina Kiang" may be true now - but
Jat the time the bug occurred the system was running CI3_2R.

IT cut off the supplied message store to a date and time of 17th November
2000 and rerolled stock unit OOH from CAP 34 BP 1 to CAP 34 BP 2. I attach
the messages produced as the file listen.dat. It will be noticed that this
jtime the Opening figures produced differ from those produced in the live
jnessage store by the numbers quoted in "28/11/2000 09:57:46 - By Lina Kiang".
this is another case of transactions being dropped. At CI3_2R this happens
Feith no error logged. At CI4L1 and above it is often the case that an error
411 be reported to the user in such cases (PinICL PC0038631)

i will have another look at M1 rollover and see if any further improvements
jcan be made in error trapping to catch other Riposte Errors.
