Attachments: DRAFT HIT Risk assessment table 20-2-2019.docx
All

As referred to

in my email yesterday, I attach a draft risk assessment prepared by our external legal team of the

likelihood/impact of the different outcomes on the questions being posed through the Horizon Issues Trial which we can
discuss at the Board sub-Committee call tomorrow.

As flagged in the document itself, this is a ‘best guess’ assessment and should not be taken as an accurate forecast of the

outcome.
Kind regards,

Jane
