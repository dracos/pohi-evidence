Dear all

Ahead of our meeting to discuss POL, which I hope is happening this week, I’m attaching the
key documents for us to consider.

The subject of the meeting is the reporting to Ministers and Governance in the Company that
took place after Tim Parker was appointed Chairman. The Minister at the time was Baroness
Neville Rolfe who asked Tim to appoint a QC to review the handling of the Horizon IT dispute
and satisfy himself that issues had been handled appropriately.

The following documents are attached:

In addition to the above, it seems that neither the QC’s report, nor the existence or conclusions of
the follow-up work commissioned to deal with the QC’s report were known to the Board of the
Company or to BEIS.

I’d appreciate your thoughts on all this at our meeting.

Tom
