Tony

I have a meeting with Post Office next Thursday to discuss any key decisions we need to take on the LOR. Given the
audience at this meeting (mainly senior commercial people rather than lawyers) these are commercial / tactic points rather
than technical legal points.

We've attached a set of decision papers (they're very short) that outline the decisions to be made and our
recommendations. Would you mind reviewing and feeding in your thoughts — particularly around the recommendations —
do you agree with them?

Any chance of getting this done today?

Rodric — by copy, please feel free to feed in your comments now or wait for Tony — your call.

Kind regards
Andy
