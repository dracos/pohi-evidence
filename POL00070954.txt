Attachments: LITIGATION_1116463.DOC

Dear Richard,

Just to update you, I received the last witness statement today and have arranged to file and
serve all of them. In view of the evidence, we have asked Castleton to agree to set aside the
default judgment on the Counterclaim, From how the witnesses have described Castleton, I
anticipate that irrespective of what his own solicitors advise, he is unlikely to voluntarily agree
to set aside the judgment (if only thorough sheer stubbornness). We're therefore continuing to
prepare for the hearing on 9 February and I attach a draft index to a bundle we've prepared. (I
have only included the very latest inter partes correspondence at tab 15, because the rest of
the relevant correspondence is exhibited to my witness statement). If you're happy with index,
we'll paginate and get a bundle over to you.

Mandy - I assume that we won't get a formal report from Fujitsu in time for the hearing as
we've not heard anything. Do you know how Dave Hulbert has got on with them? If a Fujitsu
report is imminent, we can hold off finalising the bundle for the time being.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards.

Stephen Dilley
