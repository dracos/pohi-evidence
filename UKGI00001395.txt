or Ede,

[have been contacted by 4 number of constituents living in Odiham in Hampshire who are most
upset at the fact that their local post office has been closed, anda long-standing employee, Paul
Kemp, has been dismissed due to ‘irregularities’. T would be most grateful if you would look into
these related matters as a matter of urgency.

We discussed this matter some months ago, and lam most concerned that the ‘irregularities’ may
be a continuation of the problems that Post Office employees have been having with the software
system that reconciled takings. Tam aware of 34 individual employees throughout the country who
feel they have been wrongly accused of fraud due to faults in this particular system, and am
meeting with them in the New Year to discuss what action they plan on taking. You may recall that
this case Was brought to my attention in 2008, when the SubPostmistress from South
Warnborough in Hampshire faced the same situation: It has not been rectified, a situation which
does not bring credit to the Royal Mail. 1am also writing to Ms Greene at to make her aware of
this.

Thave also asked her if she might offer some comments on the reasons why this particular Post

Office, in Odiham, is now closed? Constituents quite rightly state that it is the worst possible time
of year for it to close — in the run-up to Christmas. Odiham is a hub for a number of surrounding

small villages, and the Post Office there was well patronised.

T would be grateful if you could let me have your thoughts.
