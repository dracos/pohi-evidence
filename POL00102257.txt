Dear Mr Bailey

I am writing to you in advance of the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee inquiry into
the Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme. I am the independent Chairman of the Working
Group that oversees the Scheme.

Prior to the debate in Westminster Hall on 17 December 2014, I wrote to Jo Swinson MP, Minister
for Employment, Consumer Affairs and Equalities to provide a general update on progress with the
Scheme. My letter was referred to in the debate and the Minister placed a copy in the library of the
House. I enclose a copy for ease of reference.

Since then, the Working Group has continued to consider cases in the Scheme and in order to assist
your Committee’s inquiry, I attach an updated version of the table I provided to the Minister on the

progress of cases at appendix 1.
I hope that this information is helpful to you and the Committee.

Yours sincerely,

Sir Anthony Hooper
Chair of the Working Group

Cc Jo Swinson MP, Minister for Employment, Consumer Affairs and Equalities
Case progress as at 30 January 2015
