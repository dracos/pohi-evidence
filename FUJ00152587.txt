Gareth.Jenkins§ G RO,
Subject: Gaerwen statement
Brian

| do not understand why this statement, which was originally requested on
the 10th March is taking so long to be put together. | appreciate it is
slightly unusual, but | do not understand the confusion as | thought I'd
made our requirements clear.

Unfortunately, Gareth's annotations do not take us forward at all (and I'm
sure this is not Gareth's fault). Gareth has indicated in the attachment
below that the 3 spreadsheets produced by your team (which show the 'NIL'
transactions & which were in addition to the usual event & transaction

logs) were not produced by him, therefore as he quite rightly points out,

he is not in a position to produce them in his statement. He also points

out there are differences in the headings, which | wasn't aware of.

As already stated, we urgently need a statement producing these 3
additional spreadsheets, explaining in general terms, under what
circumstances 'nil' transactions occur and in particular how the ‘nil
transactions at Gaerwen occurred (as detailed on the spreadsheets). The
same statement needs to include a paragraph which states that there is no
evidence of a system error at Gaerwen (assuming this is the case) in
relation to the 'Nil' transactions at the office. We do not need to

mention "system failures being normal occurrences" if there is no evidence
of such a problem at this office.

As I've already indicated on an earlier e mail, it may now be best if the
Investigator dealing with this case arranges to meet with Gareth to take
the statement in person, (and it may be best to re-produce the 3
spreadsheets as one to ensure a consistent approach) but can you confirm
that you fully understand our requirements to ensure Gareth (or whoever
produced the spreadsheets) is in a position to 'tie up' all these
requirements in one statement.

By the way, I'm still waiting to receive sight of the final drafts from
Penny and Andy, producing the usual data and HSH call logs.

This statement needs more work ...... I've attached a suggested draft with
a number of comments (as mentioned previously | think the "system
failure...normal occurrence" line is potentially very damaging). It may be
worth considering someone from our team taking a statement directly from
Gareth (where is he based ?)

Whilst there is some urgency with this, it is more important to get it

right and ensure we are not embarrassed at court, which we certainly could
be if we produced a statement accepting "system failures are normal
occurrences".

(See attached file: GI GaerwenMar06 amended.doc)

The layout presumably is unfinished, paragraph spacings etc ?.

As per my earlier e mail, and more importantly the 3 spreadsheets sent with
ARQ data need to be produced as individual exhibits (GlJ/ 1 2 and 3 and
each column header within these spreadsheets must be explained as you do
with your usual statements (| noticed that 401 differs slightly from 459

and 460).

Also the line which begins at the foot of page 1 "RespCd with a value
greater than 10... ." appears unfinished ? and I'm concerned at the
words 'system failure’ which is also in an earlier line....... "There has
been some sort of system failure" - What does this mean exactly and is
there any indication of a system failure at this office during the period
in question ?

I'll get back to you once | have confirmed whether we need these statements
or not (in respect of Torquay Road & Marine Drive).

Can | also take this opportunity to clarify our requirements in respect of
the Gaerwen statement. In this case the Subpostmaster is blaming Horizon
for his losses claiming that for various banking related transactions the
counter desktop records amounts entered for payment but then shows 'Nil'
when the transaction log is printed, and it is this we need to refute.

Various e mails passed between myself and your team on this matter and the
reply below was received from Penny on the 20/10/05

Nil transactions could also be caused by errors in PIN Pad, counter, agents
or host code depending on what constitutes a "nil transaction". This cannot
be determined without access to the appropriate system logs.’

Penny also sent with the respective ARQ data, additional spreadsheets which
showed all 'Nil' transactions for the periods

(See attached file: ARQ459 Analysis Nov 04.xIs)(See attached file: ARQ 460
Analysis May 05.xls)(See attached file: ARQ401 Analysis.xls)

We therefore require the usual statement producing the Transaction and

Event logs (Penny has sent me a draft and | have suggested one or two minor
amendments). We will also need the above spreadsheets produced by whoever
put them together, explaining the headings and under what circumstances

'Nil' transactions can occur. Finally, 'to cover all the angles' | would

also like to produce the call logs during the entire period (01/11/04 -

30/11/05) so we can see whether the Postmaster ever reported this alleged
fault with the system......... a statement similar to the Bill Mitchell

statement sent in my e mail dated 10 March will be ideal.

Hopefully this will clarify our requirements in this case, but please ring
if there is any confusion.

Can | enquire when the Gaerwan statement will be ready please (bold
paragraph below). ...as it is required for the submission of
prosecution committal papers which have to be in by the end of this week
(Monday at the latest).

Also have you made any progress in deciding whether a similar statement as
to the one previously prepared by Bill Mitchell will be possible in the
Torquay Road and Marine Drive cases........ if we require one.

Subject: ARQ's, statement
request and assistance

All

Firstly sorry for the length of this e mail and the high volume of requests
attached.

(See attached file: 0506667-679 GW.doc)(See attached file: 0506680-690
GW.doc)

Both of the above requests relate to cases where PO Ltd are being
challenged

about the accuracy of the Horizon system (you are already aware of the case
at Torquay Road and have provided data between the dates now being asked
for).

Brian - In the cases of Marine Drive and Torquay Road for which you have
previously provided written responses, | would like to 'sound out' the
possibility of someone at Fujitsu providing a formal witness statement
along

the lines of the attachment below, which was provided by Bill Mitchell in
one of our criminal cases (whilst Marine Drive & Torquay Rd are not
criminal

matters, given the allegations being made by the Postmasters, I'm sure
you'll agree that it is very much in both ourselves and Fujitsu's interests

to challenge the allegations and provide evidence that the system is not to
blame for the losses being reported). Whilst it may not be a statement that
you, Penny or Neneh can provide, I'm sure there must be someone who can.

(See attached file: BM Shobnall Road SPSO 150405.doc)

On a separate matter, | also require a witness statement in respect of the
following ARQ's 0506/401, 459 and 460, all of which relate to Gaerwen SPSO.
We need the usual (leave out para's H(b) and J, but we do need para K (call
logs) covering an analysis over the period 01/11/04 - 30/11/05. Penny -

FUJ00152587
FUJ00152587
you

may recall this one which relates to nil transactions, my previous e mails
dated 14th, 21st and 25th October refer. Can you add an extra paragraph in
your statement explaining how on-line banking transactions are processed
and

the data downloaded and how nil transactions can occur.

Finally, also attached are a few more ‘normal’ ARQ's

(See attached file: 0506697-700 CK.doc)(See attached file: 0506692-694
PS.doc)(See attached file: 0506695-696 CK.doc)(See attached file: 0506691
JL.doc)

Again apologies for the length of the e mail .......... and on a Friday as
well I!!!
