Steve,

This morning I mentioned there are a few things I want to get done by keep slipping due to other bits getting in the
way.

One of them is a summary of the 3 ‘bugs’ said to have existed in Horizon

1) The 2010 incident that led to a balancing transaction injection

2) The 2013 incident that was something to do with ‘local suspenses’

3) The ‘Falkirk bug’ which was described in a couple of court cases — though found not to be relevant as I think it
only affected one branch (callendale)

We have gone back and forth to fujitsu on this, but never really nailed, in simple non tech language:
° Type of ‘bug’
© Date of ‘bug’

¢ — Impact of ‘bug’ (e.g. no. of branches affected)
e — Resolution of ‘bug’

Do you have any capacity to pull something together on this? No worries if not, I will pull it together over the next
couple of weeks — but if you can, it would be a great help.

I have attached the body of emails and docs I have on these, which would need wading through...if you have the
capacity to do it
