The Audit Client does not report overlaps or duplicates in the messsage sequences. There have been
reported incidents of JSN numbers being used for 2 different transactions and we need to capture such
instances. Also we need to be sure that any duplicate transactions as a result of harvesting errors have been
highlighted.

This is very important because we need to ensure we provide POL with the correct transaction records as
they may be used by defence and the court for litigation activity.

Sarah Selwyn has requested an audit maintenance release prior to the next DC AUDIT planned release due to go live on 14/05/2011.

lrive Peaks are requested for this maintenance release: PC0205805, PC0205806, PC0206531, PC0206590, PCO206622.

[This is an edited version of the text of Sarah's original email to Sheila Bamber:

FUJ00172221
FUJ00172221

le would like to get these Peaks targeted ASAP since these are impacting SSC and the Litigation Support Group in their support of
the Post Office litigations. There is a risk that these teams will not be able to fulfil their OLTs to the Post Office as defined
lin SVM/SDM/SD/0017 (Security Service Management: Service Description) .

ie would like to request an earlier test and deployment slot for PEAKs that are causing a significant business impact on the ssc
land Litigation Support teams ? the PEAKs for earlier deployment are:

lpco205805 and PC025806 ~ Litigation Support Group need to detect/highlight duplicate JSNs - enhancements to AUW to support
jauplicate JSN detection and reporting

Pco206531 - SSC ? takes too long to analyse events associated with ARQs due to the large volume of BAL events requires a change
to the filtering of financially significant vs benign events. A change to the presentation of the events to SSC is also required
to speed the process up.

ffesting requirements:

pco205805 and PC025806 ? use test files which include duplicate HNG-X transactions perform Fast ARQs which will now not fail on
Jauplicate detection and checking the spreadsheet output which will now report overlaps and duplicates. Test Horizon ARQs with
]auplicate JSN present to show duplicates ignored. Regression test for files with no duplicate JSNs both fast ARQ and filtering in
slow AROs.

[fhe BAL events reported in the event files output will now be of a smaller volume, nominated benign events will appear in the
rejects files (and this will constitute a large volume of total events) and the events spreadsheet will have a column heading at
the top of the spreadsheet. Regression test Gaps reporting is still present on spreadsheets. If time permits the workbook with a
number of spreadsheets as described in the PEAK rather than by manual process by the litigation team. However, this is yet to be
confirmed.

(Since Sarah's original email PC0206590 and PC0206622 have been raised to deal with issues around the large number of events.
Pco206531 is now solely to deal with the presentation of events.)
