What is this £25k of returned cash on 5 Jan?

Has this been properly recorded on the Horizon system?
Was it received back at the Cash Centre?

losses

Hi Nigel

We are aware of the problems at this branch. The letter suggests she has done all the checks we (& NBSC) would have
suggested. There is not a lot of value I can add as there is nothing recorded that would account for the different losses.

There are no transaction corrections that account for the losses or that should have compensated for them. She has already
checked her transactional records and can see nothing so it is unlikely that customers are suddenly going to start alerting us
to strange deposits into their accounts.

What may or may not be interesting is a £1K TC issued recently for a cash shortage in a rem to the cash centre. One would
have thought with the issues involved that a mistake like this would not have been made without realising. It is possible
they did realise once the rem had gone but smacks of carelessness at least

If there is anything specific to investigate I am happy to. It may be worth getting something in writing from Fujitsu to
confirm there is nothing that could have failed to have polled/ software anomalies that will come back to bite us.

Andy

Please see letter below from spmr of the above branch.

We currently have a series of large unexplained losses which the spmr is blaming on Horizon but according to Fujitsu there
are no software issues at the branch.

Ihave discussed this with Lin Norbury and she has suggested I forward this to you for further investigation. A special audit
was requested on 29 Apr and I'm just waiting for the date.

Thanks

NSA/OFS
My email of 29 Apr refers. Any news on the special audit?
