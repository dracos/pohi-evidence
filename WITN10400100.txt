                       POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




              FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF SUZANNE WINTER




I, Suzanne Winter, will say as follows:


      Introduction

   1. I am a former employee of Post Office Ltd and held the position of Fraud

      Investigator.



   2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

      with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 28th November 2023. I

      have spoken with the Witness Liaison Team in Post Office but have not relied

      on any information from them other than having asked for assistance in

      locating my start date at Post Office. In preparing this statement I have been

      assisted by Mr Fintan Canavan of DAC Beachcroft solicitors.



      Background

   3. I commenced my working life in 1972 as a book clerk in The Old Bleach Linen

      Mill, Randalstown and in 1973 I started employment as a counter assistant in

                                                                               WITN10400100




   Randalstown Sub Post Office. I was very proud to start work in a Post Office

   as my father was a Postman and my mother had previously worked for the

   Post Office and it was an institution held in very high repute.       The Sub

   Postmaster in Randalstown provided initial training and kept a watchful eye on

   me and my work until I was competent in all aspects of counter work. I

   assisted with the preparation of accounting documents for the weekly balance

   and manually completing the balance sheet. This was of course prior to the

   introduction of Horizon.



4. In early 1976 I sat the Postal and Telegraphs Officer examination and after

   interview was successful in obtaining employment in Ballymena Crown Office.

   I received three weeks training and worked at the counter for two years. After

   two years I progressed to work in the secure area of the office covering

   various jobs. Dispatching cash/stock remittances to Sub Post Offices,

   accepting cash/stock from Sub Post Offices, Acting Postal Executive in

   charge of the incomings/outgoings of the safe, Counter supervisor and

   responsible once a week for accumulating the counter balances of all the

   stock units held in the office and balancing with the figures held for the safe.

   These positions were usually held for a period of between four and six months

   when you would then change to give you experience in all of the different

   work involved. After a number of years I progressed to the writing room where

   I covered a number of jobs. The Wages Duty entailed preparing the weekly

   wages for each postman employed in the Ballymena Post Office and

   surrounding smaller delivery offices. Post Office Sales Representative

   Assistant, this job mainly involved making telephone calls to businesses to

                                                                                 WI TN10400100
                                                                               WITN10400100




   promote and sell Post Office products and services. Datapost Duty entailed

   calculating monies owed by businesses using the Datapost express service.

   Household Delivery Duty involved gathering all paperwork every week relating

   to the customer and to the relevant delivery postman and balancing.



5. A vacancy arose in the Planning Room for an auditor's position. I applied and

   after interview I was successful in obtaining the post. I worked closely with my

   line manager and he would give you a weekly plan for offices to be audited.

   As far as I am aware my manager and myself would usually be the only

   people in the office who would be aware of the Post Offices to be visited.

   Before visiting each office I needed to check stock/cash figures, staff

   employed, the area to be visited and risk assessment. The majority of offices I

   would visit by myself or my manager would accompany me if it involved a

   larger post office.



6. In 1988/1989 there was a major reorganization within the business and the

   majority of staff was moved to work in Royal Mail House Belfast. Around this

   time the business was split into two companies. Royal Mail and Post Office

   Ltd. Initially I remained an employee of Royal Mail from March 1989 and

   worked in Customer Services in Royal Mail House Belfast in the International

   Return Letter section. Unfortunately after working in the section for six months

   I opened a letter bomb. This incident meant I was unhappy to continue to

   work in this section because of the risks and I was moved to the Business

   Centre as an administrator covering various tasks. Arranging business

                                                                                 WITN10400100




   collections, household deliveries, setting up Private Boxes and assisting the

   two Postal Services Representatives to promote the business.



7. A few years later I applied for a Sales Managers post in Customer Services

   and was successful. This job entailed managing a portfolio of businesses and

   meeting financial monthly targets. I worked in this post until around 1997/1998

   when I was successful in my application to move to the Royal Mail Security

   Team as an Investigator. The job entailed detecting offences against Royal

   Mail ( for example complaints about money going missing in the mail,

   undelivered post and working with the Drugs investigators and HMRC) and

   initiating prosecutions to the Police.



8. I received initial in house training provided in the office by Royal Mail and also

   completed three weeks training in the Royal Mail Training School in Milton

   Keynes. The training covered all aspects of the role including witness

   statement taking, analyzing data, interviewing suspects, PACE, Risk

   Assessments, and Surveillance. I also attended Thames Valley Police

   Training College and undertook a search course. During the course of this job

   I worked with other investigators in the Royal Mail team, Police and Her

   Majesties Customs and Excise.



9. In 2001 after another business reorganisation I moved to Post Office Ltd

   based in Queens House, Belfast as an Investigations Manager in the Post

   Office Security Team. I received initial training in the office and then, once

   again, I attended three weeks intensive training in the Training College in

                                                                                WITN10400100




   Milton Keynes. The training again covered all aspects of the role including

   witness statement taking, analyzing data, full disclosure, interviewing

   suspects, PACE, Risk Assessments, working on the Horizon system,

   preparing case files with any updated information. I also re-attended Thames

   Valley Police Training College and undertook a search course. Once I had

   received the training I was then mentored for six months by Les Thorpe my

   line manager. I had the grade of manager but did not have anyone working to

   me so was effectively a one person department.



10.After another re-organisation my role expanded to include investigating

   robberies, burglaries and Tiger Kidnap situations. At various times the job title

   changed but the job content remained the same. I remained in the

   Investigation Team until December 2014 when I left the business under

   voluntary redundancy which was available at the time. When I first came into

   the role there was no agreed procedure or protocol in place and I transferred

   across the basic procedures and protocols from the Royal Mail role I had held

   and agreed an MOU with the police and PPS as to co-operation in

   investigations and prosecutions.



11. I had no role in Disciplinary matters as they were dealt with by the Post Office

   Contracts Manager with regard to cases involving Subpostmasters. Crown

   office staff was dealt with by Human Resources and a Senior Manager. As an

   investigator my role was to interview Post Office employees and agents who

   were suspected of, or had admitted to, committing a criminal offence and to

   ascertain the facts in the enquiry. I produced a Suspect Offender File to the


                                  Page 5 of 46

                                                                           WITN10400100




Casework Team for compliance and forwarding to the Head of Security for

comment and recommendations. If Head of Security recommended

progressing the case I prepared an Evidential Report for the PSNI to get their

opinion. If the PSNI felt sufficient evidence to progress I then completed a

Prosecution File and handed to PSNI for the PPS. It was for the PSNI to

progress the file to Public Prosecution Office. Before a suspected criminal

interview I gave full disclosure to any Legal representative who was present.

The legal representative then was offered the opportunity to a meeting with

their client before the interview commenced. Should any case progress to the

court, the PSNI and PSO would assist with disclosure. I was not involved in

any decision to prosecute nor did I become involved in agreeing litigation

strategy.   When progressing cases I liaised with various Post Office

departments depending on the nature of the case. I can recall working with

Post Office Contracts Managers, Area Managers, Postmaster Federation

Representatives, Audit Team, Security Casework Manager, Post Office

Helpline, Financial Recovery Investigators, Post Office Legal Services,

Finance Service Centre which included the lottery team and cheque team. At

one point in the time I worked in Investigations the PSNI underwent a re-

organisation and my initial files were sent to a local solicitor in Belfast,

McCartan Turkington Breen, and they reviewed the file and directed any

further investigations before the file went to the PSNI and DPP. If the Head of

Security, the PSNI, the PPS (or McCartan Turkington Breen) felt they needed

further investigations, more detail or further reports they would request these

and I would conduct the further investigations.

13. From what I can recall the Security Team included The Head of Security,

   Policy and Standards Manager, Senior Casework Manager and Compliance

   Manager. Casework Team, Fraud Investigators covering Scotland, England,

   Wales and Northern Ireland. Legal Services, Financial Investigators, Physical

   Security Managers. There may have been others but I cannot recall. There

   were numerous re-organisations throughout my time in the business and

   changes to titles and roles within teams making it difficult to be specific about

   some of these matters. Significant changes that I can recall was a particular

   reorganisation when there was a major cut back in the number of

   investigators. I cannot recall exactly when this happened. During another

   business reorganisation additional posts were created such as Financial

   Investigators and a Fujitsu Liaison Officer. I believe the Audit Team was

   integrated into Security at some point although I am unsure of that. The team

   in NI was always small and so many of the re-organisations had little direct

   day to day impact on us.



14. To the best of my knowledge I was not involved in the development and/or

   management of the above policies. I was, as mentioned before, involved

   working with Post Office Security, the PSNI and Public Prosecution Service to

   develop a Memorandum of Understanding for prosecution cases in NI.



15.Any legislation, policies or guidance governing the conduct of investigations

   conducted by the Security Team during my period of working within that team,

   if relevant, would have been communicated usually by Policy and Standards

   or the Casework team. From my recollection a different caution was issued in

   Northern Ireland and the Police and Criminal Codes of Practice in Northern

   Ireland were followed rather than their England and Wales equivalent. The

   correct routines for NI were applied. Different, NI specific, forms would also be

   used when conducting a formal interview. After completing a Suspect

   Offender file and receiving authority from the Head of Security to progress, an

   Evidential Report would be prepared and handed to the PSNI. I would discuss

   the report with the PSNI Investigating Officer and receive advice if further

   statements or documents etc. were required. Once the Evidential file was

   completed to the satisfaction of the Police I produced a Prosecution File. This

   file would be handed to the Police for forwarding to PPS. Once the PPS had

   read the file I would meet with them to discuss.



16. 1 was not working in investigations when the Post Office separated from Royal

   Mail and joined Post Office at a later date.



17. 1 do not recall the process for dealing with complaints about the conduct of an

   investigation by the Security Team but if I had to speculate I think it would be

   dealt with by a Senior Manager and filtered to your line manager. I do not

   remember any complaints being made around my investigations.



18.In respect of supervision over criminal investigations conducted by Security

   Managers this would be overseen by your Team Leader/ Line Manager and

   also the Casework/Compliance manager. Ongoing cases would be discussed

   by regular telephone contact, monthly one to one meetings, attending

   interviews and Team meetings. A casework compliance check was carried

   out to ensure everything had been completed correctly and that the same

   standards were being applied across the wider team and all required

   documentation was in place. At a monthly meeting your cases would be

   discussed in one to one sessions and if any further actions needed to be

   taken these would be discussed and agreed. I also received guidance and

   instruction from PSNI and PPS which was often of greater impact as it

   addressed the NI specific issues.



19. 1 have been asked how Post Office policy and practice regarding investigation

   and prosecution of Crown Office employees differed from the policy and

   practice regarding investigation and prosecution of SPMs, their managers and

   assistants. From what I can recall there was no difference in the investigations

   I undertook with regard to Crown office staff and Sub Postmasters. From

   recall there was a reduction in the number of audits conducted due to

   cutbacks and if assistants were suspected of committing a crime the SPM

   was advised to report the matter to the police, as it was more in line with an

   employment matter, and provide our contact details instead of the Post Office

   Security Investigation Team being directly involved.



   Audit and investigation

20. 1 have been asked to consider the document "Condensed Guide for Audit

   Attendance" ([POL00104821]). I do not recall this document. From what I can

   recall if the auditor on site, reported a significant loss or if the Counter

   Clerk/Sub Postmaster volunteered they had inflated the cash figure an

   investigator would be asked to attend. Attendance would also be required if

   the investigator had requested the audit due to concerns with the accounts or

   if another department had concerns. The investigators role on attendance

   would be to introduce themselves, their second officer and the audit team.

   They would explain why they were visiting the office, issue a caution, advise

   the person of their Legal Rights and Post Office Friend Rule, make a

                                                                                   WITN10400100




   notebook entry recording that. The investigator would remain onsite and await

   the final outcome of the audit and report to the contracts manager and to Line

   Manager. If there was no reasonable explanation for a loss identified the

   investigator would remind the person they were still under caution and invite

   them for a formal interview. This interview was arranged at an appropriate

   venue. My official notebooks were stored in a safe in my office or may have

   been sent to one of the security teams. I did not retain these myself when they

   were complete and do not have any at my home.



21. I have been asked if a shortfall following an audit of a Post Office branch was

   identified who determined whether an investigation was raised. During my

   employment there were different triggers to raise an investigation but cannot

   recall what they were. I received my investigation cases from the Casework

   Management Team and recall the Financial Service Centre would be

   contacted for information relating to the lottery, cheques etc. When the branch

   was run by a SPM the relevant contract manager was only involved in the

   disciplinary decision making. I do not recall the triggers or criteria for raising a

   fraud case.



22. 1 have been asked to consider section 7 of ([POL00085977]) regarding the

   differences between the audit process between Northern Ireland and England

   and Wales. I do not recall any specific differences between Northern Ireland

   and England and Wales in the audit process. I had limited involvement in the

   Post Office audit processes as I was in the Investigation team.

   Decisions about prosecution and criminal enforcement proceedings

23. Following an investigation in Northern Ireland a Suspect Offender file would

   be prepared and forwarded to Head of Security for any recommendations.

   They would review the information available and make any decisions. The

   decision would be communicated to the Casework Manager and the file would

   then be returned to me. Once the Casework Manager authorised progression

   of the file I produced an Evidential Report and handed it to the PSNI. The

   PSNI would consider the material and discuss the Report with me, if any

   additional material would be required and how to set out and produce a

   Prosecution file for progression to the Public Prosecution Service. This

   process was put in place by me after I joined the Security Team. Over the

   years this process developed and changed. An example of a significant

   change was when the PSNI had a reorganisation and Post Office Cases were

   processed through Ernie Waterworth, Solicitor, McCartan, Turkington and

   Breen as mentioned earlier.



24. I have been asked to consider ([POL00031034]) paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 and I

   do not recall any instances of disagreement arising in relation to investigations

   or prosecutions. I am unable to give an opinion if the Post Office maintained a

   consistent prosecution policy as I was not involved with prosecution decisions.

   In NI the PSNI reviewed the files and sought clarification before the file went

   to the PPS and it was the PPS who decided if a prosecution would proceed. I

   did not have a role in that decision making and had no involvement in any

   England and Wales prosecution cases so I cannot comment on the policy or

   consistency of the application of any policy.

25. 1 cannot recall any circumstances where steps were taken to restrain a

   suspect's assets by criminal enforcement methods such as confiscation

   proceedings were considered. I believe that Trained Financial Investigators

   would make these decisions. I was not, as far as I recall, ever involved in any

   cases of this sort nor do I recall ever being consulted about such steps.



26. I have no recall as to who decided whether criminal enforcement proceedings

   should be pursued nor do I recall any incident when that decision was made.



   Training, instructions and guidance to investigators within the Security

   Team

27. 1 have been asked what instructions, guidance and for training were given to

   investigators within the Security team particularly in relation to Northern

   Ireland, and how was this provided:

      •   I received training in house before attending a three week training

          course in the Post Office Training College in Milton Keynes. All aspects

          of interviewing individuals suspected of a criminal offence, taking

          witness statements, conducting searches, obtaining, reviewing and

          complete disclosure of evidence and report writing was covered. I was

          tested to ensure I passed the level of competence required to conduct

          PACE 1984 Codes of Practice interviews.

      •   I also attended subsequent workshops and refresher courses when

          there were significant changes to legislation or working arrangements

          within the Casework Team.

                                                                                    WITN10400100




       •   After training I was then mentored by my line Manager Les Thorpe for

           6 months.



28.To assist with Northern Ireland Law I would have taken advice from PSNI or

   PPS. There would be circumstances where information would be sought from

   third parties who might hold relevant evidence where shortfalls were identified

   in branch eg: The Paid Order Unit. In NI the various departments were

   relatively small and we maintained close contact.



29. With regard to Fujitsu I cannot recall if data would be requested in all cases of

   cash shortfalls as we had been assured by Fujitsu that the Horizon system

   was completely reliable. These assurances were given from Senior Managers

   at meetings and during Horizon Training. I did not get involved with Fujitsu

   until working in the business for a number of years when we were informed

   we had to produce an expert witness statement from Fujitsu in investigations.

   The decision to get expert reports was not made by me and I cannot recall

   who first advised me that I should get a report. I recall there were protocols to

   follow should you require their assistance and Horizon data would not always

   be requested if admissions had been made. I found the Fujitsu evidence

   statements hard to follow as they often had a lot of technical detail in them.


30.A Suspect Offender Report would be included in the case file and sent to

   Casework Manager to forward to the Head of Security for a decision to be

   made with regard to recommendations. I also worked at Crown Office

   Counters using the Horizon system during the Christmas periods when non

   counter staff would go in to local offices to provide support.

31. 1 have been asked to consider ([POL00121467]), ([POL00121485]),

   ([POL00129311]), ([POL00158977] and [POL00158978]). I do not recall these

   forms.



32. 1 have also viewed the following documents: Casework Management

   document ([POL00104747]) (version 1.0, March 2000) and ([P0L00104777])

   (version 4.0, October 2002). David Posnett's email dated 23 May 2011

   ([POL00118096]) and ([POL00118108]), ([POL00118109]), ([POL00118101]),

   ([POL00118102]), ([POL00118103]), ([POL00118104]), ([POL00118105]),

   ([POL00118106]) and ([POL00118107]).



33. 1 cannot recall if I was provided with either the 2000 or 2002 version of the

   Casework Management document when I was an investigator within the Post

   Office Security Team. With regard to instructions given on page 2 of the 2000

   version and on page 2 of the 2002 version. I do not recall the documents.

   From recall there was no prosecution process in place in Northern Ireland

   until after 2000. Compliance checks were carried out by the Casework

   Manager against a scoring sheet of 100. The scoring mark was discussed

   with my Team Leader at monthly meetings. I recall this was to ensure

   consistency and a high standard of all investigations and my understanding of

   the compliance documents attached to the email from Dave Posnett dated 23

   May 2011 was to help preparing case papers. I do not recall having any role

   in relation to their development or management. My understanding of the

   document entitled "Guide to the Preparation and Layout of Investigation Red

                                                                               WITN10400100




   Label Case File" was to advise of any identified failures in security as shown

   as the second from last point on document ([POL0011802]) after copy reports

   and tape summary. This could be where passwords for the Horizon system

   had been shared, high levels of cash held in the counter tills, sharing of dates

   stamps, safe door left open/unlocked etc. I do not know who drafted the

   document entitled "Identification Codes," but I do recall seeing it. I do not

   recall anyone ever raising the question if the document should be amended or

   suggesting it was inappropriate. My understanding of assigning identification

   codes to suspected offenders was the information was required to complete

   documents for Non Policing Authorities for entry onto the PNC (Police

   National Computer).



   Analysing Horizon data, requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu and

   relationship with Fujitsu

34. When I held the position of Investigator/Fraud Manager within the Security

   Team and any SPM/SPMs manager(s) or assistant(s)/ Crown Office

   employee(s) attributed any discrepancy to the Horizon system, I would have

   asked them to give details of the problems and if the matter had been

   reported to the Helpdesk or their Area Manager. The matter would be raised

   with my line manager and Casework Manager and a decision would be made

   to request Horizon data to be reviewed for the period in question. From my

   recall Horizon transactions could be viewed on Credence but only a few

   months. An ARQ needed to be authorised if you needed to view further back

   than this. During my work as a Post Office Investigator I was unaware of any

   issues relating to the Horizon system that could cause balancing

                                                                               WITN10400100




   discrepancies. During my initial training and at various meetings I was always

   informed that the Horizon system was reliable. I do recall some times when

   SPMs would cite Horizon as the issue but cannot recall the offices or the

   issues. I do not recall any of these being prosecuted with me as the

   Investigating officer. I would have relied on IT personnel or Fujitsu to confirm

   or deny any of these matters if they did arise.



35. 1 cannot recall for definite if an ARQ data was requested every time a SPM

   was attributing a shortfall to problems with Horizon. Horizon transactions

   could be viewed on Credence. If a case was going to progress for prosecution

   an ARQ was requested. There was only a certain number allowed to be

   requested each month from Fujitsu and you might have to wait until the

   following month.



36. I do not recall if the ARQ data was provided to the SPM as a matter of course.

   This would be a decision made by the PPS.



37. 1 do not recall [FUJ00124306] but if I required information or a witness

   statement the Casework Manager had to authorize this. I recognise Andy

   Dunks and Penny Thomas as contacts in Fujitsu and there was also an expert

   witness from Fujitsu who provided a detailed witness statement when

   prosecution cases were progressing through the court in Northern Ireland. I

   do not recall their name.



   Relationship with others

38.A few years before I left the Post Office the system for progressing Suspect

   Offender files changed and I presented my Evidential files/Prosecution Files

   to Ernie Waterworth, Solicitor in McCartan, Turkington and Breen instead of

   the PSNI. I cannot recall the reason why but may have been due to a re-

   organisation within the PSNI. I also do not remember if the cases were based

   on Horizon data showing apparent shortfalls.



   Prosecution in Devolved Nations

39. When I joined the Post Office Security Team there was no internal

   prosecution process in place as Northern Ireland has its own courts and

   system. As I had worked in Royal Mail Security previously and cases were

   handed to the police, a similar process was put in place for Post Office

   Investigations. I worked with Post Office Security Team, Post Office Legal

   Team, PSNI, and the Public Prosecution office to develop and agree a

   Memorandum of Understanding on how to progress Suspect Offender files

   through the courts.



40. 1 did not have any experience of the Northern Ireland legal system when I

   became involved in this work.



41. 1 have been asked to describe the process by which cases were investigated

   and prosecuted in Northern Ireland. In particular, to describe how the process

   in Northern Ireland differed from England and Wales and any ways in which

   the process in Northern Ireland changed during the time I was involved.

   Investigation Cases were conducted in the same ways as the rest of the

   United Kingdom except as mentioned in paragraph 37. The Head of Security

   made the decision for progressing an Evidential Report to the PSNI.

   Meetings would take place with the PSNI to discuss the case and if further

   evidence or statements were needed. A Prosecution file was processed and

   handed to Public Prosecution Office. I, and sometimes my line manager or

   another investigation manager, met with the Public Prosecution Office to

   discuss any queries. I do not recall if any of these cases were based on

   Horizon data showing shortfalls.



42. 1 have been asked to explain what instructions were complied with in

   preparing a prosecution file to support criminal proceedings in Northern

   Ireland. Several meetings took place during the course of a prosecution with

   Police and Public Prosecution Service. The instructions regarding preparing a

   Suspect Offender File were complied with in the same way as in England and

   Wales. At this stage the Memorandum of Understanding agreed by the PSNI

   and PPS was followed. An Evidential Report would initially be sent to the

   police for consideration. The Police would examine the report and advise on

   the case if any additional material was required. Once the Police agreed

   sufficient evidence had been provided a Prosecution file was prepared and

   handed to the PPS. I would have meetings with officers and the Director of

   Public Prosecutions and the legal team assigned to the case.

   in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland Post Office Investigation Team: Keith

47. My recollection of the case was when Casework advised me of overclaims

   identified in the pouches of paid foils received in the Paid Order Unit Lisahally

   from Brookfield Post Office. The overclaims resulted from values being

   claimed in add listings for which no pension or allowance foil existed. This

   was a paper based system relying on production of "vouchers" to align with

   the sums paid out.



48. My role was to investigate all lines of enquiry and gather evidence to identify if

   a crime or suspected crime had been committed.



49.Once aware of these discrepancies I received authority to arrange with the

   Paid Order Unit (POU) Lisahally to set aside the pouches dispatched from

   Brookfield Post Office and I would collect. I examined these pouches and

   recorded all discrepancies on a schedule. After a number of weeks as the

   overclaims were continuing and counter balances were not indicating

   overages I arranged a special audit of the accounts.



50.A number of weeks' worth of pouches and balances were checked and other

   enquiries conducted. From my recall these would include the history of the

                                                                             WITN10400100




   office, Human Resources Print Out, Training of Sub Postmaster, Audit

   concerns, Cash Management Records and a preliminary report would have

   been sent to my Team Leader and Casework Manager. They would review

   the case and authorise me to arrange to have a Special Audit conducted.

   During the interview with Mr McLaughlin he mentioned having difficulty in

   processing certain documents which I understood were the inputting errors.

   He also stated he had had counter losses and staff dishonesty but as I had

   always been assured there wasn't any problem with the Horizon system with

   regard to cash discrepancies I did not consider the counter losses to be

   attributed to the Horizon system. I do not recall Mr McLaughlin suggesting

   any direct issue with Horizon that would cause cash discrepancies or

   suggesting there was some error which could be attributed to Horizon.



51. I interviewed Mr McLaughlin, under caution with the assistance of Les Thorpe,

   my line manager.



52.The Public Prosecution Service made the charging decision in this case. I do

   not recall any specific discussion with them on the decision or leading to the

   decision.



53. The Director of Public Prosecutions authorised the prosecution of Mr

   McLaughlin.



54. From recall and viewing the Audit Report dated 3rd September 2004 [refer to

   AMCL0000031] Page 192 Mr McLaughlin had not raised any concerns


                                Page 26 of 46

                                                                              WITN10400100




   regarding the Horizon system creating losses when audited in May 2001.

   During interview on 26th July 2001 he did raise concerns regarding losses

   and staff dishonesty but not Horizon. I do not believe Horizon data was

   available at this time to view or that he was raising Horizon as an explanation

   for the losses.



55. 1 was the Disclosure Officer in this case but all disclosure decisions were

   made by the PPS and my job was to maintain the record of documents and

   disclosure in the Post Office.



56. My understanding of this role was to disclose any relevant material involved

   during the investigation regardless of if it undermines the prosecution case.

   Again this was overseen by the PPS and the PSNI.



57. Cases in Northern Ireland would have been discussed with the Public

   Prosecution Service, their solicitors and barristers. I do recall speaking with

   Juliet McFarlane at certain times and other solicitors in Post Office Legal

   Services but it may not have been about this particular case.



58. My reflections of this case are that I had no reason to believe the Horizon

   system was unreliable and caused balancing discrepancies as Fujitsu had

   always stated it was completely reliable. I had no concerns with regard to its

   integrity. The main issue was in overclaims for cash against paper vouchers

   for Pension payments and so the Horizon element was not a main concern

   from memory. In light of the information now available I think I would have

   asked for further checks but cannot speculate as to whether there would be

   any different view on the prosecution decision within PPS as the evidence

   related to the claims for cash against the vouchers provided and no overages

   being generated in any audits and reviews.

61.The casework team in the POU in Lisahally raised concerns with regard to

   overclaims in the paid Benefit foils received in their office from Clanabogan

   Post Office. The overclaims had been identified when conducting a routine

   check. These checks were performed against all offices during the year on a

   spot check but reasonably routine basis and if any issue was flagged it would

   trigger further investigations. The overclaims were identified by claiming for

   foils that were not present in the bundle. For a number of weeks I arranged

   with the Manager of the POU to redirect Clanabogans Pouches to me for

   further checks to be carried out. These checks identified further overclaims of

   foils being claimed but not present. I would have conducted further enquiries

   to gather as much information about the office, who worked in the office. How

   long the SPM had been in office, any concerns raised either by the SPM or to

   the SPM from Gary Groogan, Retail Manager, Denise Reid, Contracts

   Manager or the Audit Team. Credence information would be checked on

   Horizon with regard to the overclaims and call logs for any queries raised. The

   claimed missing foils should have created an overage but cash declarations

   and balance were not indicating this.



62. To establish what was happening in the office a Special Audit was requested

   and authorised from Casework. In April 2002 I attended Clanabogan Post

   Office and was accompanied by Les Thorpe, my Team Leader and John

   McKenny, Auditor. On arrival at the office I would have identified the SPM,

   introduced the team and explained that we would be closing the office to

   conduct a Special Audit due to concerns arising. Legal Rights and Post Office

   Friend arrangements were explained and they were asked to give their

   attention to the audit as it took place. Les Thorpe and I observed the audit and

   at the completion the audit result was, from the documents disclosed, a

   shortage of £152.80. I can't recall but I believe Mrs. McKelvey arranged with

   Stephen Atherton to conduct the investigation interview at his office in

   Omagh.


63. During the interview Maureen McKelvey stated she checked that she entered

   the foils on the Horizon system when paying the cash out and then at the end

   of the evening she checked them against a computer print out and had not

   identified any errors. The system operated with regard to the Camphill

   account was that Maureen Mckelvey took the foils from the books and paid

   the total due with one cheque. Mrs McKelvey stated the process for receiving

   her cash remittance from Belfast had changed and she was unable to request

   a special delivery of cash to help cover the office. This meant on occasion she

   quite often had no money to pay out to customers and she had to use shop

   money until her cash remittance was received. Maureen McKelvey was

   advised further pouches required to be examined and she and her solicitor

   were invited to attend examination of these pouches. In May 2002 further

   pouches were examined in the Crown Office in Omagh. Roy Wallace, Post

   Office Security assisted and Stephen Atherton and Maureen McKelvey

   observed. Further discrepancies were identified.


64. 1 formally interviewed Maureen McKelvey in May 2002 and no explanation

   was offered as to the discrepancies in the paid pension and allowances. A

   Suspect Offender file was prepared and forwarded to the Casework Team.

   The Head of Security directed production of an Evidential file for the Police. I

   handed the Evidential file to Police and received guidance from them on

   completing statements and if any further evidence was required. I cannot

   recall any specific directions but this was the standard approach to the file

   productions. I produced a Prosecution file and handed the file to officers in

   the PPS. Further discussions would have taken place between myself and

   PPS. The PPS made the decision to progress the case to court and Mr

   Charlie McKay BI was appointed to the case. I would have several meetings

   with him and PPS solicitors before the case was presented in court. I believe

   there was someone I needed to get a statement from on the day of the court

   case but cannot remember who it was.

66. 1 cannot recall if any Horizon data (and in particular ARQ logs) were

   requested from Fujitsu in this case. I do recall receiving a witness statement

   from Fujitsu at some point but this may have been for another case.



67.As in the earlier named case I was the Disclosure Officer in the case.



68.As disclosure officer when I gave the Evidential File to Police they gave

   guidance and advice as how to present the Prosecution File.

69. 1 met regularly with the PPS, PSNI and spoke with Post Office legal team

   during my time as an investigator and my role as a witness was, probably,

   discussed when relevant. I do not recall any specific discussion about my role

   in regard to any specific case. My own belief was that my role as a witness

   was to explain what I had done in a case and what I had discovered.



70. 1 have been asked on my reflections now on the way the investigation and

   prosecution of this case was conducted by the Post Office and the outcome of

   the case. Again I think this case relied heavily on the paper vouchers/Foils

   and cash requests and deliveries rather than Horizon discrepancies. This is

   based on my recollection and review of the various documents. In hindsight

   and with what information we now have I believe different additional

   investigations could have assisted in addressing the cash issue. However

   considering the information we had at the time and the assistance and

   decision making of the PPS I do not think there was any major concern with

   the investigation.



   General

71. 1 have been asked to what extent (if any) did I consider a challenge to the

   integrity of Horizon in one case to be relevant to other ongoing or future

   cases? In light of what we know now and also knowing more about how

   computers are not infallible I think there would be more merit in understanding

   how one error discovered may impact on other alleged errors. However I am

   not sure that an error in one process could impact on a totally different


                                 Page 37 of 46
                                                                                      WI TN10400100
                                                                                    WITN10400100




   process. The two cases in this statement relied on the old process where

   someone brought their pension, child benefit or other benefits book into the

   Post Office, the counterfoil was stamped and the voucher ripped out. The

   SPM then enters the transaction into the Horizon system and it calculates

   what cash was due and SPM paid this to the person. If they were constantly

   overpaying against the counterfoils (which could be checked with the

   vouchers) then there was an error which needed to be explained. I

   understand now that if Horizon recorded a different transaction to the one the

   SPM entered then this could cause an error but if there was a consistent

   pattern and none of the patterns showed that there was an under payment

   and so the cash showed an excess then it causes a concern. The concern

   and error did not prove illegal activity but the SPM would need to provide an

   explanation.



72. 1 have been asked whether re there any other matters that I consider are of

   relevance to Phase 4 of the Inquiry (Action against Sub-postmasters and

   others:   policy making,     audits and        investigations,   civil and   criminal

   proceedings, knowledge of and responsibility for failures in investigation and

   disclosure) that I would like to draw to the attention of the Chair.



73. 1 think there are some issues with the way the Post Office operated as a

   whole which are relevant. In NI the team was small and there was a collegiate

   and collaborative approach. When I acted as second Investigator in England

   & Wales offices I felt there was a much more hierarchical approach. People

   very much stayed in their role and did not seek to expand outside it. In NI I

                                                                                    WITN10400100




       would have been able to speak to people of all levels in different teams and

       would have felt free to disagree and debate matters. I feel this was very much

       less apparent in the England and Wales offices. I do think that the different

       legal and legislative approaches in the jurisdictions was a significant factor. I

       always felt secure as there was a review process beyond me to check what I

       was providing and to seek additional material if needed.



   74. 1 do feel very sorry for anyone who has been wrongfully accused and

       convicted. I cannot try to understand their pain and upset. I also wanted to say

       that this revelation, the Inquiry and the news which has followed has also

       been upsetting to me. As stated above I was very proud of being able to come

       and work for Royal Mail and the Post Office as we had very close family links

       as both my parents worked in these businesses. I was always proud of my

       connection and I was proud of the people I worked with. They were all very

       dedicated and hard working people and had a pride in their work. The

       revelations which suggest those higher up in the business knew about

       problems but didn't share these with the people on the ground has created a

       situation where I am no longer able to share with people I meet what I used to

       do. The hard work has been tainted. I hope this Inquiry can uncover the

       issues and can identify what went wrong, where it went wrong, who knew

       about it and why changes were not made sooner.
