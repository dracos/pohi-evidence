Thanks, Andy

SG members - to put it mildly, this is one of the more important actions we have so please do get back to Andy by the

deadline.

Mark - please could you see if we can extend the meeting by 30 mins?

All
Please find attached the draft Letter of Response (LOR).

The LOR is substantially ready for your review, save for two sections that will be addressed later: Remote
Access (as per our discussion at the SG meeting) and GLO (which is the subject of ongoing
correspondence with Freeths).

Your comments are welcomed on all of the LOR but may I ask that, as a minimum, you review the
sections marked for your attention in the attached spreadsheet.

I should be grateful if you could provide your amendments / comments by close of business on Tuesday
19 July 2016 before our next Steering Group meeting on 20 July 2016. If possible, please could you send
through comments / amendments by way of track changes to the letter.

In order to preserve legal privilege, please do not circulate the draft LOR to anyone else. You may
discuss it with colleagues if necessary to do so but if you need to forward it to someone else for input,
please can you speak to Rodric or me first.

Kind regards
Andy
