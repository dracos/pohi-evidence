Belinda and Angela

As you know Counsel Harry Bowyer of CK reviewed the information which Scottish police were able to provide in this
case. It would appear this was limited and most probably not all the information that was provided to the Procurator
fiscal .

This was not a POL investigation . However if it is now to be investigated under BAU . It is my view and advice that any
findings and further evidence discovered should be supplied to Harry Bowyer in order that he may review it. This would
ensure POL has the protection of being able to say the findings have been independently considered by external senior
barrister.

I love it when you clear out your inbox.

Tom has done a draft letter for Paula to explain that its being looked into. Angela will investigate and then decide with
Jarnail, whether a meeting with the MP might be appropriate.

So it’s in hand. Subject to Paula agreeing the letter the case is with Angela for BAU investigation.

Best wishes
Belinda

Subject: Doran case

Chris,

I wanted to bring one non scheme case to your attention and check you are content with the suggested approach. The
case in question relates to Mrs Doran (deceased).

The case was one of the original cases raised by MPs but did not apply for the Scheme

e It is an old case (2004) and relates to a (unsuccessful) prosecution brought by the police in Scotland.

e Mr Doran has written to Paula raising his case (and criticising Post Office’s handling of it) and his MP has with
James Arbuthnot sought a meeting with Paula to discuss the case — which James is chasing a response on.

The case has been looked into by the Crown Office in Scotland and Post Office has been in contact with them via
BTO — Jarnail has previously dealt with this (last correspondence I have been able to find internally April 14 is
attached).

Proposed next steps
POL00333520
POL00333520

e  Jarnail to contact BTO for any further and more recent correspondence

e Subject to that contact Crown Office to understand their views on the case and what has been provided to Mr
Doran.

e Iwill draft a holding reply to go to James

Overall if possible this does not seem like a case Paula should be meeting on and we should try to deescalate as well as
manage James’ expectations and ability to call Paula in for a meeting.
