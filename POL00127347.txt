Subject: Linklaters advice

Hi Rodric

I attach a (very) first revision of adapting the legal advice into a potential “report” format. It would be good to meet
up and discuss some of the ways in which we might change wording (to ensure the right tone etc). This will be useful,
whatever option is finally decided for communicating the advice.

Do you have any time tomorrow — let me know and I will put an hour in the diary.

Thanks
Melanie
