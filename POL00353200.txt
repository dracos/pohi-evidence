Hi angela,

Did you manage to get to the bottom of this?

Thanks Kevin,

I'll check this out as I need to understand if the Crown experience is different to that of
Agents. For agents the FSA supports the on-site training whereas in Crowns it is the Crown
staff that support the new recruits when they go back to branch.

It was nice of him.

I was in a crown branch today (Haverhill) and asking how everything was going. He said he had
a new recruit and that the reduced classroom training meant he was having to dedicate more of
his time to the new person. I know this is just one piece of feedback but thought you would want
to be aware.

Kevin,

Thanks for letting me know - HORIce continues to be worth its weight. Good
of the Spmr also to ring and let you know - not many admit it when they’re
wrong. This will have gone a long way to rebuilding the Spmr’s confidence in
the Horizon system.

Hi Henk,
Would you mind asking someone to look into this please.

The PO at Steeple Bumpstead code: 136 1139 credited £150 to a customer's IS
account when it was a withdrawal. The customer has written to bank and sent
them details of the error but has just received a statement and it has not been
adjusted (the postmaster has not had a TC either). The customer details are
below:

£150 credited needed debiting

Angela - copied to you because as you know this arose when there was a flurry of
sparrow activity and he questioned if this was to do with Horizon.

To his credit he has just phoned me to say he was wrong and to pass on his thanks
to you and your team for investigating.

Faith in humanity when the customer raises the error and goes to the trouble of
writing in and then sending evidence (doesn't sound like a particularly great
service). The PM is sending her some flowers as a thank you.

Many thanks in advance.
