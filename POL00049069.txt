Counsel defending has offered pleas to false accounting in this matter {I presume counts 2-9 inclusive] and
asked me to take instructions as to whether this might be an appropriate offer. My view is that there is
evidence she has taken the money, and that there is sufficient ‘evidence to support theft, but Royal Mail may
be content with guilty pleas to dishonesty matters if she undertook to repay the amount of the shortage at
audit, ie £36,644.89. It might be worth speaking to the officers, Graham Brander and Colin Price, to canvass

their views.

Richard
