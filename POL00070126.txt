SJD3 and Richard Morgan (RM) attending (OUT) on Mandy Talbot (MT) of Post Office Limited.
MT saying that todays news about problems with the Horizon system at the Falkirk branch
had come as a bolt from the blue, that she had known nothing about it and that Fujitsu did
not give any indication. Could we get a Fujitsu witness to give evidence?

RM saying that we need a Fujitsu witness to identify why this was a problem, but Lee
Castleton's was not. Was there a latent defect or a software problem from a subsequent
update or a hardware problem specific to that branch?

RM saying he was concerned about whether we have to give disclosure of this fact. He
thought probably yes, but wanted to find out if the judge thought it was relevant. RM was
prepared to put off a decision on this until after his opening. RM asked MT to get some
definitive answers from Fujitsu. RM saying that we may finish in court by lunchtime
tomorrow.

MT recapping.

SJD3 saying that he'd just spoken to Brian Pinder at Fujitsu and had asked them to get onto
looking into it. He has forwarded the email to Peter Sewell.
