INTRODUCTION TO THE
HORIZON SYSTEM

OBJECTIVES & INTRODUCTION

Objectives:

When you have completed this Workbook, you will be able to:

1, Identify the hardware components which make up the Horizon system,
2. Get started on the Horizon system,
a. Logon to the Horizon system.
b. Change your password.
c. Logout of the Horizon system.

Introduction:

This Workbook is the first in a series of ten describing the actions and procedures for the
Horizon system.

This Workbook is divided into two sections. Section I describes the equipment components
which, when connected, make up the Horizon system. In addition to the equipment description,
this section takes you through the step-by-step logon procedure. Section 2 introduces you to
the three main menus and how you move around the menu system.

Note:
If you are carrying out any of these training examples in the post office, the Horizon
system must be placed in Training Mode by the manager.

At the end of each Workbook, in the series there is an activity sheet which allows you to
practise the transactions covered in the Workbook. If you are not sure of the answer to
question, simply re-read the relevant section of the Workbook and try again.

The Workbooks do not cover every possible transaction which you can perform on the Horizon
system. If you need further help, or if a specific example is not covered, you should consult the
Horizon System User Guide.

Note:

The Workbooks provide values against a number of products and services that are correct
at the time of going to press. This information is subject to change and you should refer
te the appropriate POCL transaction documentation for up to date price information.

SECTION 1 - GETTING STARTED

‘RODUCTION

Introduction:

This section describes the components that make up the Horizon system and the logon/logout
procedure.

The descriptions of the components are accompanied by pictures to make them easier to
recognise. The individual components connect and interact together to make up the Horizon
system.

Access to the Horizon system is controlled by usernames and passwords. These are an
important feature of system security, Usernames are used as part of the logon procedure, to
link transactions carried out by a specific user. Passwords are a security facility.

THE SYSTEM WILL FORCE YOU TO CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD EVERY 30
DAYS.

If you believe that someone else knows your password, you must change it immediately.
This section also explains how to change your password.

The flexibility of the Horizon system allows you to specify a password of your choice within
certain defined parameters. To prevent unauthorised access, passwords MUST NOT be
written down or revealed to anyone.

The outlet manager will be responsible for setting up users on the Horizon system after
installation. Workbook 9 details these procedures,

Here is a brief description of the individual components that make up the Horizon system:

L. Processor

The processor is the brain of the Horizon
em. It stores and processes the information
passed to it.

2. Keyboard

The keyboard is one of the ways you
communicate with the processor. It consists of
six integral parts. These are:

a. Magnetic Swipe Card Reader - This enables
the processor to read and action the
information stored on the magnetic strips on
plastic cards.

b. Smart Card Reader - This allows the

Horizon system to process information

to/from smart cards.

Typing Area ~ This is based on a standard

typewriter keyboard.

d. Function Keys (or F Keys) - These keys
perform specific functions on the Horizon I
system.

e. Numeric Keys - These are numbered
keys 0 - 9 (including 00).

f{ Command Keys - These keys perform
specific commands on the Horizon system.

The monitor is used to display information. It
Jeoks the same as any other visual display unit
but has a touch screen facility. By touching
specific areas, you can carry out

procedures on the Horizon system.

There are two types of monitors used with the
Horizon system:

a. Standard monitor (shown above right)
b. Flat screen monitor (shown below right)

4, Bar-code Reader

The bar-code reader enables you to read and
record information from bar-codes onto the
Horizon system.

$. Counter Printer

The counter printer enables you to issue
receipts to your customers for items that they
may purchase, or records any payments that
you make to them.

6. A4 Report Printer

A single A4 report printer will be provided to enable you to print all the post office Ad reports
for stock and client balancing. There are two types of A4 report printer: the laser printer and
the inkjet printer. The anticipated volume of printing dictates the type of printer allocated to
the post office. Shown below are two types of A4 report printer currently in use with the
Horizon system.

Section I: Usernames & passwords Date: 29/07/99
Issue: 2.0

Before you can logon to the Horizon system, you will need to enter your username and
password.

A username and a password are required for operational and security reasons. They work in
conjunction with each other so that the person to whom they belong can be recognised on the
Horizon system.

You should note the following points about usernames and passwords:

Usernames

You will need to identify yourself when you logon. The system uses your username to control
what you can do, according to the requirements of your job. It allows you to access
information and to make any changes that you are authorised to do. It prevents you from
reading or accidentally changing anything else.

You must apply the following rules:

- NEVER allow anyone else to use your username - it is for your use only.

- Do not use, or attempt to use, any username that has not been issued to you.
Always logout from the system when you have finished for the day or if you leave the
counter for a period of time likely to exceed 15 minutes.

Your username will consist of six characters made up by the manager in the following
way:

~ Your first initial.

- The first two letters of your surname.

~ A three-digit number which will always be 001, unless there has been an identical
username created or in use on the Horizon system in last 12 months.

For example: Martin Taylor would be: MTAOOI
Michael Taylor would be: © MTA002
Michelle Tait would be: MTAO03

HORIZON SYSTEM Introduction te the Horizon System Ref: PATH/43/002
Section 1; Usernames & passwords Date: 29/07/99
Issue: 2.0

Passwords

ALL users of the system must take responsibility for its security and passwords are
essential for that security.

Note:
There are a number of rules to follow when creating your password. A password must:

1, Be private, be selected by you personally and not be revealed to anyone else.

2, Be easy to remember.

3. Not be obvious or the same as your username: eg don’t use words like PASSWORD,
SECRET, car registration numbers or personal names.

4, Be changed immediately if allocated to you by someone else. For example when you are

first introduced to the system, or when you have forgotten your password and have been
issued a new one.

5. Contain a minimum of 6 characters and a maximum of 14 characters.

6. Contain a combination of letters and numbers eg POST 1234.

7, Be changed immediately if you suspect it has been compromised.

Note:
Never write your password down and make sure you are not being watched while you are

changing it.

‘The system will automatically prompt you to change your password after the first successful
logon and every 30 days thereafter, You cannot re-use a password you have previously used in
the last 12 months on the Horizon system.

Introduction:

‘This Workbook is the first in a series of three describing the actions and procedures for the sale
of, and payment for, post office products and postage items using the EPOSS (Electronic Point
Of Sale Service} function of the Horizon system.

This Workbook is divided into two sections. Section 1 describes the Settlement menu and the
options available to the customer when paying for the products purchased. Section 2 describes
some single sale transactions to familiarise you with the Horizon system menus and then
progresses to multiple sales from the same menu groups.

if you need to reverse a transaction for a customer or if you completed it incorrectly at the
counter, refer to the procedures for reversing transactions described in Workbook 7.

Note:
If you are carrying out any of these (raining examples in the pest office, the Horizon
system must be placed in Training Mode by the manager.

At the end of each Workbook in the series there is an activity sheet which allows you to
ise the transactions covered in the Workbook. If you are not sure of the answer to a
question, simply re-read the relevant section of the Workbook and try again.

The Workbooks do not cover every possible transaction which you can perform on the Horizon
system. If you need further help, or if a specific example is not covered, you should consult the
Horizon System User Guide.

Note:

The Workbooks provide values against a number of products and services that are correct
at the time of going to press. This information is subject to change and you should refer
to the appropriate POCL transaction documentation for up te date price information.

Section 1: The Settlement menu Date: 29/07/99
Issue: 2.0

Before you conduct any transactions it is important to understand the Settlement functions of
the Horizon system and their use. At the end of most transactions, there is normally a
settlement with the customer. On these occasions the Horizon system displays a Settlement
menu screen. You can select the method of payment offered by the customer from this menu.

This section describes the Settlement menu icons and their use. Mixed payments can also be
made using the settlement menu, eg if the customer wishes to pay part of the transaction with
saving stamps and the outstanding balance with cash, this is supported by the settlement facility.

Note:

Only certain methods of payment are acceptable for each sale, eg a customer cannot
redeem gas stamps against a water bill payment. The standard methods of payment are
in accordance with current post office procedures for each product.

The initial example in this section starts from the Functions menu. In later examples the
Settlement menu will be displayed automatically when the Finish icon or the ENTER key is
activated. After each sale is completed the Horizon system will automatically return to the
Serve Customer menu.

From the Desktop menu, select Transactions, then select Serve Customer.

1. Touch the Functions icon,

or Press F16 on the keyboard.

The Settlement menu is displayed.
From this screen you can accept a
variety of methods of payment.

I Remember the customer can mix the
methods of payments offered (within
current post office rules) to meet the
total settlement amount.

You can return to the Serve Customer

All the icons on this menu allow a certain type of payment to be made for a sale item. If a
mixture of payments is made for certain supported items you will need to use more than one
icon from the menu to finish the sale. If stamps or vouchers are redeemed a st a sale, the
Horizon system only allows payments specific to the redemption rules.

Section 2: Saving stamp sales using the Quantity function Date ees

This exercise describes the sale of items using the Quantity function of the Horizon system. If
a customer requests several items with the same fixed cost, it would be unrealistic and
time-consuming to keep Touching the screen or Pressing the keys to reach the correct number
required. The Quantity function of the Horizon system allows you to set the amount required
before activating the icon for the product.

In this Quantity function example, the customer has requested the following items:
6 x £5 MYL saving stamps.
From the Serve Customer menu:

Notice that the Quantity icon will always display the figure 1 as a default.

1. Touch the Quantity icon,

I The Enter Quantity screen is displayed.
The system prompts you fo type in the

Check the quantity entered is correct before continuing.
3. Touch the green tick icon, or Press ENTER on the keyboard.

The Horizon system has returned to the Serve Customer menu. Notice, however, that the
Quantity icon is now displaying the number 6. Any fixed price item selected will automatically
be multiplied by 6.

You can set the quantity prior to the sale of an item by simply typing in the number
required using the keyboard WITHOUT activating the Quantity icon.

Section 2: Saving stamp sales using the Bin function Pate: 2007

Occasionally, a customer may change their mind when requesting a sale item, or you could
Touch the wrong icon by mistake. You can delete any sale item in the sales stack using the Bin
function (with the exception of APS transactions, refer to Workbook 6). If, however, the
transaction session has been completed and settlement made, you must reverse the transaction
to rectify the error (refer to Workbook 7 for Reversals). The following example demonstrates
the use of the Bin function.

In this example the customer has requested the following items:
1 x £2 TV Saving Stamp

- x £2 BT Saving Stamp

From the Serve Customer menu:

1. Touch the TV Stamp £2 icon, or Press FS on the keyboard.

2. Touch the BT Stamp £2 icon, or Press F6 on the keyboard.

Both sale items have now appeared in the sales stack on the right-hand side of the screen and
the total of the two items requested is displayed in the Finish icon, (£4 in this example ). The
customer realises at this stage that they do not have sufficient funds for both items and now
only wants the £2 BT stamp.

As the sale has not yet been completed, you can delete the £2 TV Stamp from the sales stack.

3. Touch the Bin icon, or Press DEL on the keyboard.

As you can see, the Bin icon fades when you Touch it, then remains shaded for 3 to 7 seconds,
after which it returns to its normal state. To delete an item from the sales stack. you must
Touch jt while the Bin icon is in its faded state. Allow the icon to restore.

4. Touch the Bin icon, or Press DEL on the keyboard.
Within seven seconds:
5. Touch the £2 TV icon in the sales stack, or Press T2 on the keyboard.

OBJECTIVES & INTRODUCTION

Objectives:

1. Complete transactions from the Travel, Licences and Personal Finance groups.
2. Complete an MVL transaction registering a mixed payment.

3. 2 the Horizon system to register Girobank and National Savings transactions.
4 e the Horizon system to register Green Giro transactions.

Introduction:

This Workbook is the second in a series of three describing the actions and procedures for the
sale of, and payment for, post office products and postage items using the EPOSS (Electronic
Point Of Sale Service) function of the Horizon system.

This Workbook is divided into two sections. Section 1 covers general navigation and
transactions from the Travel and Licences menu groups. Section 2 covers transactions from the
Girobank and National Savings menus.

If you need to reverse a transaction for a customer or if you completed it incorrectly at the
counter, refer to the procedures for reversing transactions described in Workbook 7.

Note:
If you are carrying out any of these training examples in the post office, the Horizon
system must be placed in Training Mode by the manager.

At the end of each Workbook in the series there is an activity sheet which allows you to
practise the transactions covered in the Workbook. If you are not sure of the answer to a
question, simply re-read the relevant section of the Workbook and try again.

The Workbooks do not cover every possible transaction which you can perform on the Horizon
system. If you need further help, or if a specific example is not covered, you should consult the
Horizon System User Guide.

Note:

The Workbooks provide values against a number of products and services that are correct
at the time of going to press. This information is subject to change and you should refer
to the appropriate POCL transaction documentation for up to date price information.

HORIZON SYSTEM

OBJECTIVES & INTRODUCTION

Objectives:
When you have completed this Workbook, you will be able to:

1. Complete EPOSS Scales transactions using the various Horizon system customer facilities.

Introduction:

This Workbook is the third in a series of three describing the actions and procedures for the sale
of, and payment for, post office products and postage items using the EPOSS (Electronic Point
Of Sale Service) function of the Horizon system:

This Workbook covers transactions using the Scales menu group. The Horizon system will
assume that electronic scales (Avery Berkel D104) are attached to the system. If this is the case
then the weight of postage items will be registered automatically by the Horizon system. If
electronic scales are not attached to your system, you can still use all the functions and

services associated with the Scales menu, however you will have to enter the weight of the mail
item using the keyboard or on screen keypad. In addition to basic Scales transactions, the
Horizon system provides additional functions and services connected with mail items: these are
used and explained in the examples.

The Scales function of the Horizon system will allow you to complete mail item transactions up
to 6 kg in weight. Mail items above 6 kg should be treated as postage items, and the price of
the service(s) required should be obtained from the appropriate mail compendium.

If you need to reverse a transaction for a customer or if you completed it incorrectly at the
counter, refer to the procedures for reversing transactions described in
Workbook 7.

Note:
If you are carrying out any of these training examples in the post office, the Horizon
system must be placed in Training Mode by the manager.

At the end of each Workbook in the series there is an activity sheet which allows you to
practise the transactions covered in the Workbook. If you are not sure of the answer to a
question, simply re-read the relevant section of the Workbook and try again

ORDER BOOK CONTROL SERVICE (OBCS)

OBJECTIVES & INTRODUCTION

Objectives:
When you have completed this section you will be able to:

1. Receive, issue and encash benefit from bar-coded order books, using the Horizon system.

2. Receive, issue and encash benefit from bar-coded order books, manually entering the
details of the order book due to a bar-code reader failure or an unreadable bar-code.

3. Encash benefit from non bar-caded order books.

introduction:

This Workbook describes the actions and procedures that are carried out on the Horizon system
whenever a customer presents an order book for encashment. The procedures for the receipt,
redirection and issue of bar-coded order books is also described.

Whilst vigilance at the counter cannot be overstressed, the Order Book Control Service (OBCS)
incorporates an Electronic Stop Notice Computer System (BSNCS) which will inform you if a
bar-coded order book is subject to a stap or recall notice when the bar-code is read by the
Horizon system.

Note:

All current POCL regulations regarding the encashment of benefit from order books at
the counter still apply, eg all foils must be retained after encashment and retained in value
order in the drawer.

Note:

if you are carrying out any of these training examples in the post office, the Horizon
system must be placed in Training Mode by the manager. All bar-codes printed in the
Workbook, can be used in conjunction with the examples deseribed.

At the the end of each Workbook in the series, there is an activity sheet which allows you to
practise the transactions covered in the Workbook. If you are not sure of the answer to a
question, simply re-read the relevant section of the Workbook and try again.

Section 1: Bar-coded order books Date: 29/07/99
Issue: 2.0

Order books are now being produced with bar-codes clearly visible on the front covers.
Eventually all order books will be bar-coded. This will ensure that a clear audit trail can be
traced through the Horizon system whenever a bar-code is scanned for receipt, issue or
encashment.

Order books issued by different authorities may differ in design, so the bar-code and order book
details may not be in the same place. The order book reproduced below shows the typical
position of the bar-code and the book details required to carry out a manual

encashment,
Customer Reference
Number which can be
the National Insurance Common Payment
Serial Number Number (NINO) Package (CPP) number

Bar-code Position of the
Additional Indicator
(not present on all
order books)

When a bar-coded order book is presented for payment, the bar-code is scanned. This ensures
that the details of the order book are cross-checked against the ESNCS. Ifa stop or recall
notice has been placed on the book, the instructions on screen MUST be followed and the book
impounded.

Stop Notice
If a step notice is placed on an order book, the book must be impounded and NObenefit
can be paid, even if there are valid foils.

Recali Notice

If a recall notice is placed on an order book, then benefit can be paid up to a limit
imposed by the Benefits Agency eg a maximum of I valid foil. The book must then be
impounded.

Valid foils are order book foils due for payment up to the present day and still in date, ie an
order book foil is out of date 3 months and I day from the day after the due date on the foil.
The recall date indicated on screen may be some time in the future.

Note:

If the bar-code cannot be read after three attempts, there is no reason why the procedure
cannot be carried out at an alternative system in the post office. But if there is only one

3. Touch the Manual Input icon, 4 or Press Fi on the keyboard.

The Customer Reference screen is

At this point you must decide if the
problem lies with the bar-code on the
order book, or with the bar-code reader
itself.

Notice the Receive box on screen shows that the System Failure line has been set to NO. This
is because the Horizon system will ALWAYS assume that the problem lies with the bar-code on
the order book and not with the system. Therefore if you decide the problem lies with the
bar-code reader, then the System Failure line must be set to YES.

Note:
if the line is left at NO, the system will automatically impound the order book because it
believes the bar-code is faulty.

4. Touch the System Failure line on the screen, or Press the Up arrow on the keyboard.

The System Is Down screen is
displayed on the left-hand side of the

OBJECTIVES & INTRODUCTION

Objectives:
When you have completed this Workbook you will be able to:

1. Complete Automated Payment Service (APS) Magnetic Card and bar-coded bill
transactions.
a. Recognise APS cards and bar-coded bills.
b. Complete APS card and bar-coded bill transactions and apply the scheme criteria to the

Introduction:

This Workbook is divided into two sections describing the actions and procedures for
Automated Payment Service (APS) transactions.

Section 1 describes how you carry out AP card and bar-coded bill transactions using the APS.
It also describes how an AP transaction is reversed if a mistake has been made. Section 2
briefly describes the procedure to follow in the event of a power or communications failure.

Note:
If you are carrying out any of these training examples in the post office, the Horizon
system must be placed in Training Mode by the manager.

At the end of each Workbook in the series there is an activity sheet which allows you to
practise the transactions covered in the Workbook. If you are not sure of the answer to a
question, simply re-read the relevant section of the Workbook and try again.

The Workbooks do not cover every possible transaction which you can perform on the Horizon
system. If you need further help, or if a specific example is not covered, you should consult the
Horizon System User Guide.

Note:

The Workbooks provide values against a number of products and services that are correct
at the time of going to press. This information is subject te change and you should refer
to the appropriate POCL transaction documentation for up to date price information.

SECTION I - APS TRANSACTIONS

INTRODUCTION

Introduction:

This section describes the actions and procedures for completing Automated Payment Service
(APS) transactions, either using cards with a magnetic strip or bar-coded documents.

All AP schemes including gas and electricity token schemes are treated as Core products and as
such are available at ALL post offices. This allows you to offer a range of services to your
customers and POCL’s clients.

All transactions are performed on the Horizon system. The criteria set by the client (with the
exception of cheque guarantee card requirements) will be applied automatically by the Horizon
system.

In addition to transactions, this section also covers the procedure for reversing APS
transactions.

Note:
All company names and telephone numbers used in the APSmagnetic card or bar-coded
bill transactions in this Workbook are fictitious.

The transactions shown in this Workbook using the APS cards or the bar-coded bills (printed in
the Workbook) can be carried out in your post office, in Training Mode, using the set of APS
cards issued to the manager. Refer to Workbook 7 for the procedure to place the Horizon
system in Training Mode.

Section 1: Description of an APS card Issue: 2.0

There are hundreds of schemes for client payments using APS (Automated Payment Service):
these may be national or local. Each scheme has criteria imposed by the client, setting out rules
for how payments are made, APS transactions would normally be initiated in two ways:

- A swipe card with a magnetic strip.
~ A bar-coded bill.

Before transactions can be carried out, some system rules must be observed:

1. All transactions must be started fromm the Serve Customer menu.

The post office must support the scheme for which the payment is offered. If a payment is
attempted and the post office does not support the scheme, the Horizon system will display
an error message.

If the scheme is not supported by the post office, then the customer must be informed.
Some APS schemes will not allow payments outside certain parameters set by the client.

If the payment offered by the customer falls outside the payment parameters of the scheme,
the customer must be asked to amend the payment. If the customer has offered to pay an
amount above the client set maximum, it is acceptable to complete two or more transactions
totalling the ammount the customer wishes to pay.

nw

WE

You will find each client will have a different design on their card. There are some common
features which are applicable to all cards. The training cards incorporate these basic design
features. On the reverse of the card there is a magnetic strip which contains the information
relating to the scheme criteria. The front of the training card incorporates the following features:

Six training cards are issued with the Horizon system, which you can use to practise
transactions in Training Mode. The bar-codes (replicated on bills in this Workbook), can also
be used to practise APS transactions.

Note:

Any transactions perfermed in Training Mode using the training cards or bar-codes will
not be recognised by the Horizon system in Live Mode and will not affect the accounting
process.

bar-code reference number

Occasionally, a bar-coded bill may be presented for payment and the bar-code on the bill cannot
be read. This may be due to a system failure, or it may be that the bar-code itself is damaged.
If the bar-code has been scanned three times with the reader and this has not activated the
payment procedure, you can still accept a payment by entering in the details manually.

From the Serve Customer menu:
1. Scan the bar-cade on the bill for Hooper Moore gas (3 times).

There may be an occasion when an APS card or bar-coded bill payment needs to be reversed.
A number of business rules apply to AP (Automated Payment) Reversals:

The customer MUST produce the original receipt.
The Reversal must be carried out within the same Stock Unit where the original transaction

took place.

The Reversal cannot take place if the APS transactions have been dispatched to the

client (at the cut-off time).
Not all APS transactions can be reversed.

SECTION 2 - APS FALLBACK RECOVERY
PROCEDURES

INTRODUCTION

Introduction:

This section briefly describes the actions and procedures you must follow to recover Automated
Payment Service (APS) transactions carried out during power or communications failures.

In the event of a power, system or communications failure, the Horizon System Helpdesk must
be informed immediately o (refer to Workbook 8). In this case, you MUST
refer to the Horizon System User Guide to carry out the fallback recovery procedures.

Section 2; APS fallback recovery procedures oa

Fallback recovery procedures are used to capture details of all APS transactions undertaken
while the system was down. They fall into two categories:

1. Crash recovery procedures

These are procedures which need to be undertaken to capture details of transactions which had
been partly recorded on the system when the system or power failure occurred. In cases of
crash recovery, the customer has been given a receipt and the post office has retained a receipt.

When the system failure is rectified, the system automatically detects that a failure occurred
during a customer session where receipts would have been issued. When you log onto the
system, a message is displayed informing you that the system has detected that the last session
ended in an undefined manner. It also tells you to recover any outstanding APS transactions.

Note:
Kor these reasons it is important that the last transaction receipt fer each counter position
is available in case there is a system or power failure.

You must follow the on screen prompts to enter the details required for each APS transaction.

Note:
You MUST refer to the procedures in the Horizon System User Guide.

2. Fallback recovery

The fallback recovery procedure is for APS transactions which have not been recorded on the
system. These transactions may have taken place while the systern was down and a manual
receipt was produced for the customer. Because no attempt was made to record these
transactions on the system, you have to instigate the fallback recovery procedure, as the system
will not recognise the transactions automatically.

Note:
You MUST refer to the procedures in the Horizon Spstem User Guide.

Introduction:
‘This Workbook is one of a series describing the actions and procedures for the Horizon system.

This Workbook is divided into two sections. Section I describes the Functions menu and gives
practical examples of how the functions can be used. Some of these functions described are
used with EPOSS transactions. Section 2 describes various office-level transactions and shows
the procedures for registering them on the Horizon system. These include Remittances, Non
Accounting Data and Parcel Traffic (entries on TABLE 10g and 12 in the Cash Account).

At the end of each Workbook in the series there is an activity sheet which allows you to
practise the transactions covered in the Workbook. If you are not sure of the answer fo a
question, simply re-read the relevant section of the Workbook and try again.

Note:
if you are carrying out any of these training examples in the post office, the Horizon
system must be placed in Training Mode by the manager.

The Workbooks do not cover every possible transaction which you can perform on the Horizon
system. If you need further help, or if a specific example is not covered, you should consult the
Horizon System User Guide.

Note:

The Workbooks provide values against a number of products and services that are correct
at the time of going to press. This information is subject to change and you should refer
to the appropriate POCL transaction documentation for up to date price information.

introduction:

This section deseribes the actions and procedures available when using the Horizon system
Functions menu. The Functions menu group is available from the Serve Customer menu. The
actions that can be selected from the menu can affect individual or multiple items in the sales
stack. In order to demonstrate the use of the Functions icons, some of the examples in this sec-
tion will incorporate EPOSS transactions.

Note:
The Discount functions available from the Functions menu can only be used in
conjunction with retail products (Post Shep items).

This section also describes how the Horizon system is placed into Training Mode. Once this
procedure is complete, you will need to use the training usernames and passwords to logon to
the system and carry out transactions in Training Mode. These usernames and passwords are
issued to the manager of your post office.

Section 1: Quantity Tesue: 2.0

The Horizon system will always preset the Quantity for any transaction to 1. Therefore, when a
customer wishes to purchase more than one of the same item, the Quantity function should be
used. This function allows the user to preset a Quantity prior to selecting the item required.
Once the item has been selected, the Quantity will return to its default value of 1.

This example demonstrates the use of the Quantity icon to register a sale of 100 First Class
stamps.
From the Serve Customer menu:

Section 1: Shopping Mode Issue: 2.0

Occasionally, a customer may request a quantity of items for a specific amount of money
eg they may request £10.00 worth of First Class stamps. The Horizon system can calculate the
volume of items for a specified amount if the Shopping Mode is set on the system.

There are two rules enforced by the system when using the Shopping Mode:

1. Shopping Mode can only be used for fixed price items.

2. If the value typed is less than the cost of a single item, the Horizon system will inform you
that the amount specified is below the price of a single item.

In this example the customer has requested £50.00 of First Class x 10 stamp books.

From the Serve Customer menu:

1. Touch the Functions icon, or Press F16 on the keyboard.

Section 1: Temporary Lock Issue: 2.0

The Temporary Lock function of the Horizon system provides a security mechanism for all
users, The Logout icon, located on the main Desktop menu, will log you out of the Horizon
system completely. However, if there are any transactions displayed in the sales stack, access
to the Logout icon is denied by a no entry symbol. The Temporary Lock function will allow
you to secure the Horizon system temporarily and retain any sale items in the sales stack
(typically when you have to leave the system briefly). To regain access to the system, you will
be required to type your password.

Note:

Anybody with manager level access to the Horizon system can override a Temporary
Lock (or a time-out) by deleting the username on screen, (indicating who had locked the
system). They can then enter their own username and password as normal. This will log
the original user out of the system. ANY sale items that had been left in the sales stack
will automatically be completed to Cash. The new user will then have to Logon in the
usual manner.

The following example demonstrates the sale of an item, the activation of the Temporary Lock
function and the procedure to regain access to the system. The customer has requested a £10
BT Phonecard.

From the Serve Customer menu:
1. Touch the Other Products icon, or Press F13 on the keyboard.
2. Touch the Phonecards icon, or Press F14 on the keyboard.

3. Touch the BT card £10 icon, 0 or Press F4 on the keyboard.

As this is a fixed cost item, it is registered directly into the sales stack.

You are now required to leave the Horizon system unattended for a short period of time before
you can complete this customer session. You must secure the system and retain the sale item in
the sales stack.

4. Touch the Riposte Serve Customer icon, or Press HOME on the keyboard.

5. Touch the Functions icon, or Press F16 on the keyboard.

Anybody with manager level access to the Horizon system can override a time-out by
deleting the username on screen, (indicating who had locked the system). They can then
enter their own username and password as normal. This will log the original user out of
the system. ANY sale items that had been left in the sales stack will automatically be com-
pleted to Cash. The new user will then have to Logon in the usual manner.

Issue: 2.0

A Reversal is a transaction which is performed when it is necessary to to correct a mistake or to
provide a refund to the customer. A Reversal does not result in existing transaction information
being amended or deleted from the system. It does, however, create new information which
compensates and corrects the original transaction.

There are four types of Reversals:
1. New Reversals

A new Reversal is needed when there is no need to

ociate the transaction with an

2. Existing Reversals
This type of Reversal is used to provide a reversal or refund for a transaction for which
there may be a receipt. The transaction number would be entered to initiate the
reversal. An Existing Reversal does not always have to have a receipt as you can use
the Transaction Log to find the transaction reference number, (refer to Workbook 10).

3. AP Reversal
This type of Reversal is used when the original transaction was for an APS card or
bar-coded bill transaction. The AP transaction number would be entered to initiate the
Reversal.

4. Transfer Reversal
This type of Reversal is used when the original transaction was a transfer between two
Stock Units within the office. This can only be carried out after the transfer out has
been completed from your Stock Unit but before the transfer in takes place in the
receiving Stock Unit.

Note:
You cannot reverse a reversed transaction.

A number of system rules must be adhered to befere a Reversal can be completed:

1. A transaction can only be reversed if the product involved is identified by POCL as
being reversible.

2. Transactions can be reversed only if they were transacted in the current post office
Cash Account Period.

3. A transaction must be reversed within the Stock Unit in which it was originally
carried out.

4, A transaction that has already been dispatched to the client cannot be reversed
(ie after the client cut-off).

§. When reversing linked transactions, the primary transaction must be reversed rather
than the associated transaction.

the ink end indicator will not work correctly with the new ink cartridge.

Replace the ink cartridge as follows:

Step 1.

Make sure that the Ink Out light is flashing or
lit continuously and that the printer is not
printing. (De net turn off the printer).

Step 2.
Open the printer cover using the tabs on both
sides.

Step 3.

Hold down the Lead/Eject button for about
five seconds until the printhead unit moves
left slightly to the cartridge replacement
position. The Power light begins flashing.

Note:

Caution - do not move the printhead unit

py hand. Always use the Load/Eject

button to move it, otherwise you may
damage the printer.

Note:

The printhead automatically returns to the
home (far right) position after about 60
seconds if you do not begin the
replacement.

Step 4.

Lift up the ink cartridge clamp as far as it will
go. When you do, the cartridge will partly
rise out of the ink cartridge holder.

Step 5.

Lift the cartridge out of the printer and
dispose of it locally using the new cartridge’s
wrapping. Do not take the used cartridge
apart or try to refill it.

Note:

Warning - if ink gets on your hands, wash
them thoroughly with soap and water. If
ink gets into your eyes, flush them

Otherwise, the cartridge may become
unusable.

Step 9.
Press the Load/Eject button to return the printhead unit to its home (far right) position. The

printer charges the ink delivery system.

Note:

Even if you do not press the Load/Eject button, the printhead automatically returns to the
home (far right) position about 60 seconds after you replace the ink cartridge.

Note:

Caution - during the ink charging pracess, the Power light flashes. Never turn off the
printer while the Power light is flashing. Doing so can result in incomplete charging of
printer ink.

Step 10.

Close the printer cover.

The procedure described above has demonstrated the action required to replace the ink
cartridge for the EPSON Stylus 200 report printer. Always ensure you have a spare ink
cartridge available.

SECTION 1 - POST OFFICE LOG ON

INTRODUCTION

Introduction:

This section describes the actions and procedures which need to be followed to connect the post
office to the Post Office Network after installation of the Horizon system. The Post Office Log
On (POLO) procedure should only be carried out once. After that, a modified procedure should
be carried out to reconnect the post office to the Network after a power failure or a processor
replacement. To assist you with the POLO procedure, the Horizon Field Support Officer
(HFSO) will be present in the post office after the Horizon system installation.

Note:

The POLO procedure cannot be practised when the Horizon system is operating in
Training Mode. If you need to carry out the POLOprocedure in the post office when the
HFSO is not present, refer to the procedures in the Horizon System User Guide.

Section I; Connect the post office to the Post Office Network cree
(Post Office Log On) i

The first operation you will have to perform on the Horizon system is to connect the post office
to the Post Office Network. This process is more commonly called the Post Office Log On
(POLO) and must be carried out on the Gateway workstation first. The Horizon Field Support
Officer (HFSO) will be present to assist you in this procedure.

Tf you have a single Horizon system installed in the post office, that system is automatically the
Gateway workstation. Where more than one Horizon system is installed, the Gateway
workstation will be clearly identified on the screen (see the screenshot on page 8).

‘To perform the POLO procedure, you will need to use the Postmasters Memory Card (PMMC).
A similar procedure will then need to be performed on every other system in the post office
using the PMMC and the Personal Identification Number (PIN) produced during the initial
logon.

Note:
After a power failure the POLO process will need to be carried out again to re-establish
the link to the Network.

Postmasters Memory Card (PMMC).

Front of PMMC Reverse of PMMC

Note:
‘The Postmasters Memory Card (PMMC) must ALWAYShe stored in a secure location.

The PMMC is a smart card, and information relating to the POLO procedure is stored on the
gold-coloured patch on the front of the card.

Note:

‘Two PMMCs are issued with the Horizon system. One is used in the initialisation
procedure, the other is a spare in case the first is mislaid. If you have to use the spare
PMMC for any reason, refer to the Horizon System User Guide.

Section 2: Usernames Date: 29107199
Issue: 2.0

Note:
The manager will be responsible for preparing the system to accept the post office staff as
users of the Horizon system after installation.

Usernames:

A username and a password are required for operational and security reasons. They work in
conjunction with each other so that the person to whom they belong can be recognised on the
Horizon system.

As the manager, you will be required personally to set up each member of your staff as a user
on the Horizon system. Usernames are used to control what users can do according to the
requirements of their job. This allows therm to use the system and make authorised changes.

Usernames must consist of six characters, which you make up in the following way:

~ The first initial of the user's first name.

~ The first two letters of their summame.

~ A three-digit number which will always be 001, unless there is an identical username in use
or created in the last 12 months.

For example: Martin Taylor would be: MTAOOL
Michael Taylor would be: =MTA002
Michelle Tait would be: MTA0O3

Note:
The manager is required te complete and keep a Horizon System User Registration Form
for each username currently in use and those deleted during the previous 12 months.

Note:
If a username is deleted on the Horizon system it can never be reused.

Section 2: Passwords

Date: 29/07/99

Issue: 2.0

Passwords:

You must allocate each user a password, which they will use to log onto the Horizon system.
The first time they log onto the Horizon system, they will be required to change their password
immediately.

ALL users of the system must take responsibility for its security and passwords are
essential for that security.

Note:
‘There are a number ef rules to fellow when creating passwerds. A password must:

1, Be private, be selected by you personally and not be revealed to anyone else.

2. Be easy to remember.

Not be obvious or the same as your username: eg don’t use words like PASSWORD,

SECRET, car registration numbers or personal names.

4. Be changed immediately if allocated to you by someone else. For example when you are
first introduced to the system, or when you have forgotten your password and have been
issued a new one.

3. Contain a minimum of 6 characters and a maximum of 14 characters.

Contain a combination of letters and numbers eg POST1234.

7. Be changed immediately if you suspect it has been compromised.

a

Note:
Never write your password down and make sure you are not being watched while you are
changing it.

The system will automatically prompt you to change your password after the first successful
logon and every 30 days thereafter. You cannot re-use a password you have previously used in
the last 12 months on the Horizon system.

Section 2: Stock Unit introduction Date: 29/07/99
Issue: 2.0

STOCK UNIT TYPES:
The Horizon system supports two types of Stock Units:

~ Individual Stock Unit.
~ Shared Stock Unit.

Here is a description of both types of Stock Units and the working method they support:

INDIVIDUAL STOCK UNIT
Only one user at a time can be attached to an Individual Stock Unit. The single user therefore
has accountability for events occurring in that Stock Unit during the time(s) they are logged on.

The Individual Stock Unit therefore supports the Individual clerk accountability working
method. This ensures that only one user at a time is attached to any Individual Stock Unit.

Note:

This does not in itself ensure individual accountability, as another user can be attached to
this Stock Unit if the original user is detached, (which is done by attaching them to
another Stock Unit),

Note:

If you try to attach a user to an Individual Stock Unit already in use, the Horizon system
will refuse the attachment and inform the user that the stock unit is not shareable and
already has a user attached.

SHARED STOCK UNIT

A Shared Stock Unit supports several users, each of whom may be attached and logged on
simultaneously. When a Shared Stock Unit is balanced, each user of that Stock Unit may be
responsible for the declaration of the stock, stamps and cash representing their portion of the
Stock U The system will require a declaration identity number (this identifies the portion of
ihe Stock t) to be entered after each declaration of the stock, stamps and cash is made. The
declaration identity number is a two digit number allocated to the portion of the Stock Unit by
the manager. Each declaration made with a different identity number will then be added
together to form the total stock, stamps and cash held in the Shared Stock Unit. When the
balance report is ready to be produced, only one user can be logged onto and using the Shared
Stock Unit. All other users attached to the Stock Unit must logout of the Horizon system,

Note:
It may help to liken a Shared Stock Unit to a number of drawers from which users share
stock.

The Shared Stock Unit supports the Team working method. This allows several users to be
attached fo a Shared Stock Unit at the same time. The system does not allow Stock Unit
balancing whilst more than one user is logged on to the Stock Unit.

Section 2: Stock unit intraduction, continued

Date: 29/07/99
Issue: 2.0

Any user can be attached to any Shared Stock Unit in the post office, but a user can only be
attached to one Stock Unit at any time, whether it is Shared or Individual.

Note:
Workbook 10 describes the procedures for balancing Individual and Shared Stock Units.

All Stock Units used on the Horizon system are type-designated Individual or Shared Stock
Units, they may also be allocated the status of:

~ Default Stock Unit.
- Inactive Stock Unit.
- Correction Stock Unit.

Default Stock Unit

The Default Stock Unit is a system-maintained holding area. When a user is created on the
system, they are automatically attached to the Default Stock Unit.

Users attached to the Default Stock Unit are allowed to use a limited set of functions. They are
excluded from transacting Post Office business relating to stock and cash.

Note:
If a user attached to the Default Stock Unit is required to carry out Serve Customer
transactions, they should notify their manager at once.

Users attached to Individual Stock Units must be attached to another Stock Unit (usually the
Default) before a different user can be attached to their Individual Stock Unit.

The Default Stock Unit is a Shared Stock Unit.

Inactive Stock Unit
An Inactive Stock Unit is one where no transactions have been carried out during the current
Cash Accounting week. As these Stock Units have remained inactive since the last balance,

they can be rolled over using the previous week's balance figures.

The Inactive Stock Unit may be either Individual or Shared.

Section 2: Stock Unit introduction, continued pate

Correction Stock Unit

A Correction Stock Unit is created by the outlet manager to correct errors found in the Cash
Account when reconciling all dockets against the Trial Cash Account report. (The procedure is
undertaken only after all Stock Units have balanced), The user must firstly correct the errors
and then deal with the gain or loss discrepancies.

The Correction Stock Unit may be either Individual or Shared.

Note:
The outlet manager must make a written note of when and why a Correction Stock Unit is
created.

From time to time, it may be necessary to alter or modify the way Stock Units are set up and
used. These functions are available on the Horizon system and access to the functions is
dependent on the level of user access.

Note:

It is not possible to change a Stock Unit from Shared to Individual or vice versa ~ to do
this a new Stock Unit has to be created and the old one deleted. Certain rules have to be
observed before it is possible to delete a Stock Unit, eg it must hold no stock or cash and
be in a balanced state. For further information on Stock Unit deletion, refer to the
Horizon System User Guide.

Introduction:

This Workbook describes the actions and procedures needed when balancing the Horizon
system. Whilst it is fair to say that no two outlets will necessarily carry out the balancing
procedure in exactly the same way, this Workbook will follow a logical progression that will
conclude with the Cash Account Report being produced for the outlet by the Horizon system.

The Workbook is divided into three sections. Section 1 describes the actions required to
complete Daily and Weekly reports and perform the client cut-offs as required. Section 2
describes the actions that must take place to achieve a Stock Unit balance. Section 3 describes
the actions that need to be carried out to produce the office Cash Account report.

Note:
if you are practising these procedures in the office, the Horizon system must be placed in
Training Mode by the manager.

it would not be practical to cover every possible balancing scenario which could be
encountered on the Horizon system. If you need further help, or if a specific example is not
covered in the balancing Workbook you should consult the Horizon System User Guide.

At the end of each Workbook there is an activity sheet which allows you to practise the
transactions covered in the Workbook. If you are not sure of the answer to a question, simply
re-read the relevant section of the Workbook and try again.

Note:

The Workboeks provide values against a number of products and services that are correct
at the time of going to press. This information is subject to change and you should refer
to the appropriate POCL transaction documentation for up to date price information.

Steck Unit balancing everview Date: 29/07/99
Issue: 2.0

The production of the Cash Account, using the Horizon system, requires you to follow a series
of steps, starting with balancing each Stock Unit in the post office. Once all Stock Units are
balanced, then the Cash Account can be produced. A breakdown of the Stock Unit balance
procedure is shown on pages 8 & 9.

The Horizon system is capable of producing various reports. They can be accessed at any time,
although a number of them must be produced during the Stock Unit balance, otherwise the
process cannot be completed.

The types of Stock Unit used in your post office dictate some of the actions you perform to
carry out the balancing procedure. The declarations used for an Individual Stock Unit are
slightly different from those of a Shared Stock Unit.

This Workbook describes the basic balancing procedure and highlights the differences between
balancing a Shared and Individual Stock Unit, such that the Stock Unit can be rolled over into
the next CAP (Cash Account Period) or the next BP (Balance Period).

Note:
Cash Account Period (CAP) denotes which accounting week you are in during the
current financial year.

Balance Period (BP) can be a portion of a CAP. During periods of high turnover there
may be twe Balance Periods during a single Cash Account Period.

Reports are re-produced where required in this Workbook. They are used as examples to
describe the procedure. The types of reports required will be dependant on the business carried
out in your outlet during the last Cash Account Period,

From time to time there may be a discrepancy between the Horizon system derived figures and
the actual holdings of Stock, Stamps and Cash. This Workbook describes adjustments and the
functions available to help locate the source of the discrepancy. In a training environment it
would be impractical to cover every individual problem which may occur when balancing. If
further assistance is required to cure a balancing problem, you should refer to the Horizon
System User Guide and thereafter your POCL Regional Helpline.

Note:
The Horizon System Helpdesk should be used ONLY for Horizon system procedural
problems or equipment defects.

INTRODUCTION

Introduction:

This section describes the actions and procedures required to produce system-generated reports.
There are a number of different types of reports that can be produced from the system, these are
for information only but they can help to locate an error or mistake carried out on the system.
The Counter Daily and Weekly reports are required to be produced to reconcile the work
carried out in the post office during the day or accounting week. The End of Day process is
also described.

Section 1: Reverse an existing transaction from a report Pate 20"

in the previous example, a BT Bills report was produced. If, during your reconciliation of the
details on the report, (prior to activating the client cut off), you notice that the details of one of
the original transactions had been entered incorrectly, then the error needs to be rectified before
the cut-off is carried out.

In this example the customer’s original BT bill payment should have been for £20.00 but
during the transaction on the Horizon system an extra zero was added to the amount. The BT
Bills report produced has indicated that the payment was entered as £200.00. If this transaction
is not corrected a discrepancy of £180.00 will occur when the Stock Unit is balanced. In this
case, the correction can be made by reversing the BT bill payment for £200.00 and completing
a second BT bill payment for the correct amount of £20.00.

The report itemises all the BT bill payments made since the last time the cut-off procedure was
carried out. Note that the Session Number for each transaction appears on the left-hand side of
the Customer Account number. This is required to reverse the original transaction, which is
classed as an Existing Reversal.

The Reversal will start from the Desktop menu:

1. Touch the Transactions icon, or Press Fi on the keyboard

2. Touch the Reversals icon, or Press FS on the keyboard.

The Horizon system will now search for the original transaction. If it can be reversed the
Horizon system creates another transaction in the stack to the value of -£200.00 to offset the
original BT bill payment.

if the original transaction cannot be found the Horizon system will display a message to that
effect.

6. Touch the Finish icon, or Press ENTER on the keyboard.

The Settlement screen is displayed. You should select the method of payment used by the
customer in the original transaction, ie Cash or Cheque. The Counter Daily Cheques Listing
report can be used to confirm whether a cheque fad been used as the original method of
payment, refer to page 19.

In this example the original transaction was completed with a Cash payment by the customer.
7. Touck the Cash icon, or Press Fi on the keyboard.

A Reversal receipt is now produced on the counter printer, The original BT bill payment has
now been reversed.

Nete:
The customer s original BT Bill must now be completed for the correct amount of £20.00.

From the Serve Customer menu, you would now complete a BT Bill payment for £20.00 (cash)
using the Customer Account number obtained from the original BT Bills report.

On completion, the BT Bills report must then be reprinted and the client cut-off performed.

Section 1: Counter Daily Cheques Listing report oe eee 2

The final Counter Daily report that should be produced is the Cheques Listing report. This is
the exception to the procedure described on page 13.

At the end of the day the Cheques Listing report should be printed (or previewed) and the
cheques reconciled against it. Once you are happy with the information on the report the
procedure can be completed. The cheques can then dispatched to the Data Processing Centre in
accordance with current POCL procedures. However, on the Horizon system, the dispatch of
the cheques is classed as a Remittance Out of the post office. Once the cheques have been
remitted out of the post office the Cheques Listing report can be produced again and the cut-off
applied at that point.

In the following example, the Cheques Listing report will be produced, the cheques remitted
out of the post office (dispatched), and the report taken a second time. Then the cut-off will be

activated.

declaration identity number for the portion of the Stock Unit that has been declared. The cash
can be declared as one total figure, or a series of declarations corresponding to the number of
portions into which the Stock Unit has been divided. The system will then add all declarations

Occasionally an error notice may be generated by a client or by POCL. The post office will be
notified of it and the actions to be taken to correct the error. The Horizon system allows you to
process error notices from the Housekeeping menu. All error notices require a value entry.

Note:
The processing of an error notice will affect the Daily report for some products eg NS.
Error notices must be processed as soon as they are received.

In the following example, an error notice has been received from National Savings. The
notification informs the outlet manager that a National Savings Error Notice Deposit must be
recorded for £50.00.

Section 2: Move Vouchers (or Unclaimed Payments) into the pate

Suspense Account

The Suspense Account has been created to account for stock or cash that cannot be allocated to
transactions of specific products or stock whose value cannot be entered into accounts proper
until a later date, These items are more commonly referred to as Unclaimed Payments or
Uncharged Receipts and appear in Tables 2, 2A and 3 on the Cash Account report.

To enable the Stock Unit to balance, these items must be moved into the Suspense Account to
allow the items to be carried forward between CAPs. On completion of the Stock Unit roll
over, the items must be reclaimed from the Suspense Account, as this process is not carried out
automatically. If the items are not cleared before the next rollover, the procedure must be
repeated,

In the following example a voucher for £1.04 was accepted as a method of payment. If the
vouchers are still present when the Stock Unit is balanced, they must be moved into the
Suspense Account to allow the Stock Unit to balance.

all the postage stamps held in the Stock Unit. Once you have completed this, you can declare
the stamps on the Horizon system.

Section 2: Re-declare Stamps or Cash on Hand (Individual one
Stock Unit) sues &

During the declaration of the Stamps on Hand or the Cash on Hand, you may view a
discrepancy on the system that you are not happy to accept. If this is the case, once the
declaration has been completed, you can investigate the discrepancy. If you then find that the
stamps or cash were declared incorrectly, they can be re-declared. The Horizon system will
remember the volume or values of the stamps or cash previously declared, allowing you to
overwrite the existing declaration on the system.

In the following example the stamps declared earlier were incorrect. You have re-counted the
stamps in the Stock Unit and found that a sheet of 39p stamps were not included in the original
declaration. Therefore the total of 39p stamps need to be increased to 242.

From the Desktop menu:
1. Touch the Stock Balancing icon, or Press F4 on the keyboard.
2. Touch the Dect Stamps icon, or Press F2 on the keyboard.

The Declare Stamps on Hand screen is
displayed. The stamps declared earlier
can be seen on screen.

To edit the 39p stamps declared, you
miust move to page 3 of the list.

3. Touch the Down green arrow icon twice, or Press PAGE DOWN twice on the keyboard.

The 39p stamps declared earlier can
now be overwritten with the correct
quantity held.

4, Select the correct stamp value to be edited by Touching the stamp value on screen, or
Pressing the ENTER key until the correct stamp value is highlighted.

The system will now perform various checks automatically. For example:

- Have all Daily/Weekly summaries been taken? If not the Horizon system lists all those
reports not yet produced.

- Are there any negative stock items in the Stock Unit? This would generally indicate a
Remittance In or a Transfer In that had not been completed on the system.

Are there any RD Cheques, POCL Cheques or Vouchers in the Stock Unit? These
should be moved into the Suspense Account and the item adjusted to zero in the
Stock Unit.

- Are there any discrepancies in the Stock Unit?
In this example all summaries have been taken and there were no negative stock items or RD

Cheques, POCL Cheques or Vouchers in the Stock Unit. However the system has found a
minor discrepancy which had been accepted earlier.

Section 2: Shared Stock Unit declarations Date: 29/07/99
Issue: 2.6

With a Shared Stock Unit the declaration process is slightly ditferent from that of the Individual
Stock Unit. With the flexibility that the Shared Stock Unit offers ie a number of individuals
using the same stock at the same time, a Shared Stock Unit can be balanced in one of two ways:

~ The Stamps and Cash can be declared in one go, similar to the Individual Stock Unit, with a
single Declaration Identity number. The stock can be adjusted rather than declared.

~ The Stock, Stamps and Cash can be declared in several portions ie the contents of the safe
{or bulk) can be declared early in the day, with the stock and cash in use at the counter
declared as each counter position is withdrawn. Each portion of Stock, Stamps and Cash
must be declared with a different Declaration Identity number.

If the first method is to be used a Balance Snapshot can again be used in the balance process to
help in the physical check of all stock held in the Stock Unit. A stock adjustment can then be
curried out on the system to ensure that the system reflects the actual contents of the Stock
Unit.

The main advantage of the second method is that the balance process can be started during
quict periods of the day. The contents of the safe (bulk) may be declared early in the day with
a Declaration Identity number unique to the safe, for example 10. The counter may be
operating with two small portions of stock and cash. One of these may be withdrawn in
mid-afternoon and the Stock, Stamps and Cash declared with a different Declaration Identity
number, for example 11. This would then leave only a small proportion of Stock, Stamps and
Cash to be declared at close of business with a different Declaration Identity number, for
example 12. When the Balance Report is ready to be produced the system will then add
together the declarations for Stock, Stamps and Cash ie the stamps declared with the identity
numbers 10 + 11 + 12 would equal the Stock Unit holdings of Stock, Stamps and Cash.

A mixture of the two methods can also be employed, with a single adjustment of stock carried
out at the close of business, with the Stamps and Cash declared, (with different Declaration
Identity numbers), at various points throughout the day.

Introduction:

This section describes the actions and procedures required to produce the office Cash Account
report. This element of the procedure is rather procedural, as the Stock Unit balance is the
critical element of the office balance. The system will use the figures from the Stock Unit

Section 3: Create a Correction Steck Unit to hold errors in the Date: 29/07/99
Issue: 2.0
Office Balance

During the Office Balance procedure, a member of staff may have rolled over their Stock Unit
having accepted a discrepancy. If the discrepancy is found after the Stock Unit is rolled over
(but before the Cash Account is produced), the Stock Unit cannot be amended, as the figures
have been accepted by the Horizon system. Since this discrepancy has been found, a new
Stock Unit can be created to hold the discrepancy so that it can be accounted for in the office
Cash Account, thereby allowing the office to balance. The discrepancy can then be transferred
back into the original Stock Unit on completion of the Cash Account.

If a correction Stock Unit is created in this way, the outlet manager must make a written note of
when and why the Stock Unit was created. The creation of a correction Stock Unit is exactly
the same as the creation of an Individual or Shared Stock Unit described in Workbook 9.

In the following example, a Green Giro has been paid out to the customer but not carried out on
the system. The cash was taken out of the Stock Unit causing a discrepancy of £50 at the end
of the week, The Stock Unit was balanced and rolled over into the next CAP with the
discrepancy, however the mistake has now been noticed. A Correction Stock Unit will now be
created so that the Giro will be registered with the Horizon system, creating a positive
discrepancy to offset the original one.
