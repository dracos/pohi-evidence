Alan

I know that you are just back from leave however can we schedule an audit for this branch
(earliest possible date) , the OIT team have spoken to the branch and the subpostmaster has
been extremely evasive about how much money he has on hand, there has been an horizon
problem at the branch over the last two days or so, but that does not excuse his failing to comply
to requests to return excess cash

He has stated that a nearby branch is closing and this is what is generating extra payments,
however looking at the area, it cannot be generating anything near what he is holding.

Can you ensure that we send no more money to this branch until we have an audit result. I
appreciate it may well be a week before we can get this organised but if he has what he declares
every Wednesday then he won't run out of money, and if he hasn't it should make for a short
audit, or clearly identify a different problem.

John Breeden, could well be a suspension and RTU if money not on hand, if we have a closure
under NC nearby then we may have to do something about getting service reinstated, however
probably best left until we know the result.

David thanks for your support on this one, good to have made contact to get a better picture of
what is actually happening in the branch.
