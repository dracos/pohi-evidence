The recent email from Leigh-Anne has not landed well with Declan and Jeff . Jeff has asked me to convey his
disappointment with this — firstly BDO QA at partner level has let this document get to us and waste our
time proofreading it with some sentences not really sentences.

Secondly he also feels this is missing the mark on quality as well as clear forensic objectives and strong
methodology. As per the meeting with Declan, Jeff and myself we are up to our eyeballs in audits —- we don't
need another one and need to go beyond that - we need to quickly get to data analysis driving the answers
to Declan’s three questions using the six areas Jeff and I sent through.

Jeff has asked how you intend to either restore his confidence or alternatively withdraw from the work
immediately. With that in mind can we have a new proposal by close of play tomorrow with an appropriate
resourcing team that inspires confidence. I would also suggest that the response focuses immediately on
the SDLC area to capitalise on the momentum we have with Fujitsu currently — this is very fresh but will soon
go stale if we don't get after it rapidly.

Happy to do a call if it helps.

Regards

Tony
