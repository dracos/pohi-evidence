 I think the email trail below will be of interest.
 I wanted to do an internal check across all the finance systems as well as Horizon but the feelings of the Lawyers was
 `negative' at first, also there were no 'trends' in the information we had.

I would have thought keeping it internal would ensure that we are merely responding to challenges to check there is no
validity. Any suggestions how we respond to below!!

Dave,
If it is thought that there is a difficulty with Horizon then clearly the action set out in your memo is not only needed but
is imperative. The consequence however will be that to commence or continue to proceed with any criminal
proceedings will be inappropriate. My understanding is that the integrity of Horizon data is sound and it is as a result of
this that persistent challenges that have been made in court have always failed. These challenges are not new and
have been with us since the inception of Horizon as it has always been the only way that Defendants are left to
challenge our evidence when they have stolen money or where they need to show that our figures are not correct.

What is being suggested is that an internal investigation is conducted. Such an investigation will be disclosable as
undermining evidence on the defence in the cases proceeding through the criminal courts. Inevitably the defence will
argue that if we are carrying out an investigation we clearly do not have confidence in Horizon and therefore to
continue to prosecute will be an abuse of the criminal process. Alternatively we could be asked to stay the proceedings
pending the outcome of the investigation, if this were to be adopted the resultant adverse publicity could lead to
massive difficulties for POL as it would be seen by the press and media to vindicate the current challenges. The
potential impact however is much wider for POL in that every office in the country will be seen to be operating a
compromised system with untold damage to the Business. Our only real alternative to avoid the adverse publicity will
be to offer no evidence on each of our criminal cases. This should mitigate some adverse publicity but is not a total
guarantee.

To continue prosecuting alleged offenders knowing that there is an ongoing investigation to determine the veracity of
Horizon could also be detrimental to the reputation of my team. If we were to secure convictions in the knowledge that
there was an investigation, where the investigation established a difficulty with the system we would be open to
criticism and appeal to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal will inevitably be highly critical of any prosecutor's
decision to proceed against Defendant's in the knowledge that there could be an issue with the evidence.

What we really need to do is impress on Fujitsu the importance of fully cooperating in the provision of technical
expertise and witness statements to support the criminal and civil litigation now and in the future.

Given the nature of the discussions that took palce on the 26/2 I am staggered that I was not invited to take part in the
conference.

All,

Can we please ensure that Rob Wilson (Head Of Criminal Law, RMG) is kept appraised of the situation and included
in any further meetings/updates on this subject. Our prosecution cases have faced an increase in challenges as well
as our civil cases, so the activities outlined below, and indeed going forward, are applicable to both Legal teams.

All,
following our conference call today, below is a brief summary of the agreed key activities to progress the next steps in
relation to the above piece of work:

1) AH & MT to provide SL/DK with information on past and present cases with reference to the Horizon Challenges
(Criminal & Civil cases).
(*Note: I have asked the fraud team to review approx. past 2-3 years casefile although these challenges are of a more
                                                                                                                               POL00326799
                                                                                                                           POL00326799




recent nature).

2) Information Security (SL &DK) to conduct initial investigations and provide Terms of Reference outlining remit and
requirements to carry out full investigation (inc. resource, timescales and any associated ancillary costs).
(N.B. agreement by all that with DK and our 'banking consultant' (Paul Hallidan), we have far more expertise and
knowledge than anyone else is likely to produce for this initial piece of work).

3) Subject to agreement of 2 above, conduct full investigations into integrity issues, with conclusions/ report provided.
Once investigated and conclusions drawn, gain external verification to give a level of' external gravitas' to the
response to these challenges. (Recommend Ernst & Young as most suitable partner to complete this...TBA).

Additional:
AP: DP to continue with investigation into Alresford (outstanding debt) case and feed into MT & wider review.
AP: DP to forward details to all on previous investigations conducted on 2 x Horizon challenge cases.
Note: Ensure that any response formulated includes an ongoing review to any developments/Changes to Horizon, that
in turn will support legal challenges in the future. (DK commented that there were already systems in place that would
verify and support this).

As I am away next week could I ask that you direct any immediate responses via Dave Posnett please.
