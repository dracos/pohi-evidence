lam very sorry to have to advise that Mr Castleton has now sacked his solicitors and has totally refused
to sign the Tomlin Order despite being actively involved in its negotiation last week. As no order has been
signed no settlement has been achieved and now I must advise that the trial will almost certainly take
place.

As alitigant in person he is unlikely to agree to evidence being submitted by witness statement only and
is likely to demand their presence in Court. I am sorry to have to advise this after being convinced that a

highly desirable settlement was imminent last week. Castleton is apparently takin:
this may be affecting his judgement. There is to be a case management conference next week which will
be another opportunity for our team to seek to persuade Castleton of the need for a settlement. Our
witness evidence is ready and the accountants report is now being finalised. Castleton has supplied
almost no evidence and as such is unlikely to be able to challenge our case or support a robust defence.

I will keep you updated with any further developments.
