CEO’s Report - March 2015

1. Introduction to this month’s Board and overall strategic priorities

e Ahead of our final Board meeting of this financial year, I want us to celebrate the
unprecedented pace of transformation now underway, and draw confidence from this
as we accelerate our turnaround further in 2015-16. This report provides updates on
developments over the last month, and I would highlight:

o We have had a number of recent successes across our product portfolio: signing
the new Post Office Card Account contract to safeguard the service for a further 7
years; reaching a successful conclusion on the valuation of the general insurance
business to support our buyout from Bol; and launching the Post Office’s identity
assurance service ‘Verify’.

o With the Board’s support, we have taken greater control of the Mediation Scheme
by closing the Working Group, and seen negligible press coverage.

o Weare well ahead of targets for Network Transformation with 5,000 contracts now
signed and the 4,000" transformed branch opened. I would like to thank Kevin
Gilliland in particular for his outstanding leadership of this programme.

o We have now secured agreement from both Unite and the CWU to a new Post
Office pension arrangement which will be launched with effect from 1 April
2015. The scheme will be called the Post Office Pension Plan and is applicable to
all employees who are currently in the Royal Mail Defined Contribution Plan.

o 1am personally delighted by the increases in positive engagement across both our
postmasters (up from 44% to 45%) and staff (up from 58% to 62%). This would be
worthy of celebration in any event, but is even more remarkable at a time of very
significant change, and reflects both strong leadership and open and honest
engagement with our people.

o And finally, the move to the new Customer Support Centre in Finsbury Dials on the
16" March has been a great success, with excellent feedback from staff and a real
buzz around the office. I am already seeing the benefits of the Group Executive
beginning each day around the ‘hub’ and I am confident this move will be a decisive
enabler of a more open, collaborative and agile working culture across the Post
Office.

Key issues for discussion at this Board:
e We have three substantive topics for discussion at the March Board meeting:

e Firstly, I have asked Nick to provide the Board with an update on how we propose to
exercise our option to buy the Bank of Ireland’s share of the joint insurance business
(Hawk). As you know, the Independent Insurance Expert (IIE) concluded that the
valuation of the Business is £43.9 million and, whilst 9.8% outside the Board mandate,
this is within the Post Office’s value horizon.

e The Board is asked for approval to allow management to proceed with the acquisition of
Bol’s share of the Business at the given valuation, and approval to negotiate potential
alternative structures with the Bol, which could allow us to utilise POMS to pursue an
investment products strategy. Alice and I had a positive and constructive meeting with
Christopher Fisher and Des Crowley from the Bank on the 11" March, which confirmed

CEO’s Report March 2015 1

POL-0023949
POL00027308
POL00027308

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

both their interest in continuing to work with us on general insurance and a willingness
to consider investment products. They are, as we anticipated, concerned about the
relationship beyond 2023. However, there was commitment on both sides to
understand what it would take for the partnership to be successful such that it could
continue beyond this point.

e Alisdair will then talk us through the latest in-year financial performance followed by
leading a discussion to seek the Board’s approval of the financial plan and scorecard
for 2015-16. At the Board in January we discussed a draft of the financial plan which
was designed to reduce the EBITDAS loss from £64m to £34m. The latest version of
the plan addresses the Board’s feedback, and is substantially more realistic than both
the previous year’s plan and the draft submission in January. Al and I have led
challenge sessions to review the assumptions underpinning income projections for next
year, and the Group Executive has reviewed the plan on two occasions. This version
sees a reduction in net income to reflect the removal of optimism bias and creation of
contingency, offset by additional cost reductions to retain the EBITDAS target at -£34m.
Whilst more realistic it is important to note that the plan remains challenging.

e The KPI scorecard builds on the changes agreed with the Remuneration Committee,
and includes financial targets focusing on EBITDAS, digital income, and refinements to
the customer satisfaction measures. The scorecard also proposes further changes to
the non-bonus related metrics to rationalise them in number, following discussion by the
Group Executive.

e Finally, Martin George and Geoff Smyth have prepared a paper to facilitate a Board
discussion on the strategy for our telephony business, and specifically our homephone
and broadband services. At the June Board Awayday last year we agreed to prioritise
the mails and financial services businesses, recognising that telephony, along with
government services, would be secondary pillars going forward. Given this, I wanted
the Board to have the opportunity to review the strategic options available to us for the
telephony business, and in particular whether it should be retained as part of our group
portfolio or divested to release capital and reduce management distractions.

e The paper provides analysis of a range of options and seeks the Board’s agreement to
retain and grow the business in the short-term. This recommendation recognises the
positive (and growing) Direct Product Contribution the business provides, with minimal
funding requirements and a low impact on the network. Following a pause prompted by
the regulator, we will also resume talks with potential partners to discuss divestment
and franchising.

2. Commercial and business performance overview

Overall performance

e Netincome in February was favourable to budget driven primarily by the additional
revenue for the new POCa contract. Total expenditure also remains favourable to the
budget, meaning the £99m EBIT target is still within reach. However, the forecast
remains in line with the update to the board in January of £95m. Our focus for the final
weeks of 2014-15 remains on delivering income in line with forecasts and maintaining
tight cost control.

e The CFO's Performance Report for this Board provides additional commentary on
performance across the pillars so these are not summarised here to reduce duplication.

3. Other updates of note for the Board

Sparrow

e As the Board will know, we announced on 10" March that we had completed all of our
investigations under the Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme, and that we had
decided to mediate all cases that had not been subject to a court ruling. In addition, we
published a 187 page report detailing progress on the Scheme so far; announced that
the Working Group overseeing the Scheme was to close with immediate effect and
gave notice of termination to Second Sight.

e Despite extensive hostile briefing by JFSA, there has been limited media coverage. PA
ran a very short, balanced piece picked up by some regional media. There was a very
hostile piece in Computer Weekly that does not seem to have been picked up and has
now been amended to add more balance. In Parliament, James Arbuthnot attempted to
secure an Urgent Question on 11" March. This was rejected but he was called as the
first supplementary question at Prime Minister's Questions, suggesting that Post Office
had “sacked” Second Sight and were attempting to suppress their Part Two Report —
inaccurate on both counts. The PM committed Vince Cable to writing to JA and the
Sparrow team have provided material to BIS in support.

e The priorities now are to progress as many cases to mediation as quickly as possible.
Second Sight have also given us their updated draft of their “Part Two” Report which is
intended to assist in the mediation process. It is inaccurate and inflammatory; we will
respond shortly.

e I am sure the Board will wish to join me in thanking Mark Davies and Jane MacLeod in
particular for their leadership in helping us take control of this agenda.

Engagement with the NFSP.

e Weare reaching a critical point in our discussions with the NFSP relating to the MoU,
NT Cliff and Network Extension and I therefore wanted to update the Board on
progress. As part of the settlement we reached with the NFSP relating to the 2013 NT
funding, the Board endorsed the establishment of a 15 year agreement with the NFSP,
the agreement itself dependent upon the NFSP re-structuring their organisation and
supporting the Post Office in the delivery of NT, particularly elements related to
compulsion, noting that any network extension was excluded from the parameters of
the MOU. We have made good progress in the last 12 months in achieving delivery of
NT and moving the NFSP towards a position of supporting further business change
including our plans for Network Extension. This is in an environment where we have
yet to sign the Grant Agreement (GA) whilst maintaining our position of wanting to work
collaboratively but only in circumstances that are right for the business — this approach
has improved our position substantially.

* It should be noted that the NFSP continue to push for additional funding using the
possibility of withdrawing support for NT and joining the CWU. Our approach has
reduced their demand position significantly and we will continue to press for further
agreement/concessions as we do not believe a merge with CWU is their preferred
outcome (though this risk cannot be ignored). Our approach remains well within the
mandate agreed with the Board and we will keep you updated on progress.

4. Update on key change programmes

e Work is well advanced to establish the necessary governance, processes and capability
to implement our change programmes as an integrated portfolio. This includes strong
central governance led by the Transformation Director, and activity is now being
managed to an integrated plan through the Transformation Management Group.
Particular attention continues to be given to the implementation of the new Front Office
solution given its business-wide impacts.

e Revised reporting is being developed to manage the portfolio of change programmes
and it is our intention to introduce this for the Board in May. For this month, updates
are provided to the existing format.

a) Crown Transformation Programme

Status overview: 292 branches have now been transformed with 4 more expected by end
of March, achieving the original target. Staff cost reductions, staff training and SSK
implementations are all achieving or exceeding targets. Around 19 branches will not be
franchised under CTP as no suitable partners have been secured. The P&L run rate for the
retained Crown estate at March 2015 is forecast to be around £3m loss with P&L break-
even run rate targeted for later in 2015-16.

c) ‘Win in Mails’

Status overview: The build of the Access Point solution continues, including the additional
products required by retailers. Taking the learning from the Ivy trials, the project has
decided not to trial a mails only solution in May 2015, but instead launch when the minimum
viable solution for retailers is available in spring next year. This will include a more
developed payments proposition to take on our main competitors.

Work is underway with Oliver Wyman on the next steps for mails, as discussed at the Board
in January.

5. Market, political and external developments

Third party parcel access point market growing

e DPD is set to open 2,500 PickUp stores as part of its parcel shop network on 1st June
2015. Numark Pharmacies, a network of 3,000 independent pharmacies, has been
named as its first retail member. DPD say their aim is to have a DPD PickUp point
within ten minutes of “most people in the UK”. In 2013, DPD announced it extended its
partnership with myHermes ParcelShops for HomeCall Returns, its own return service.
At the time of the agreement there were 3,000 myHermes ParcelShop locations which
has now grown to ~5,000. In 2013, DPD delivered 1.6m parcels a week. Doddle also
announced plans to open 70 more locations in railway stations and shopping centres
taking the total number to 100 by the end of 2015. Doddle has already signed up
retailers such as Amazon, Asos, Charles Tyrwhitt and Misguided.

Amazon Logistics set to expand

e Amazon Logistics is set to expand after successful Sunday deliveries. Sunday
deliveries quadrupled from last year. Amazon Logistics currently uses 45 different local
and national delivery firms. The service is currently free for its subscription paying
Amazon Prime customers. According to the head of Amazon UK, Christopher North,
“Amazon Logistics is not about replacing a carrier, it is about complementing”. Amazon
UK has not revealed what portions of its products are delivered through Amazon
Logistics, but it is understood to reach close to 50% some weeks. North insists Amazon
has no interested in pushing all its deliveries through Amazon Logistics. He stated, “The
answer is you want to spread your volumes across multiple partners. You don’t want to
have a single point of failure.”

Competition in the challenger bank space grows

e Virgin Money is set to launch its current account nationwide by April 2015 after
launching in Northern Ireland and Scotland last year. Tesco announced plans to grow
its share of the current account market to rival its credit card business. However, both
face a challenge in winning customers over with only 3% of accounts being switched
since reforms were introduced according to the Yorkshire Building Society.

e TSB announced pre-tax profits of £134m in 2014, up 2.3% on the previous year. It
added 0.5m new accounts in 2014. Understanding the challenges to get customers
switching, it is exploring the option to raise its share of the current account market from
4.2% to 6% through acquisition.

Purpose

This paper updates GS on the negotiations with Bank of Ireland UK plc (Bol) on Project
Hawk - the exercising by Post Office of its option to buy Bol’s share of the joint insurance
business (the Business) as set out in the Eagle agreement (“FSJVA’).

This submission follows the paper presented to the Board on 16" July 2014, where
approval was given for “management to negotiate a buy-out of Bol’s share of Post Office
Insurance business at a cost not exceeding £40m” (Board Minute POLB 14/91).

The Independent Insurance Expert (IIE) has opined, concluding that the valuation of the
Business is £43.9 million; this determination is final and binding on both parties (although
there will be a final true-up on completion). This value, while 9.8% outside the Board
mandate, is within Post Office’s value horizon.

This paper seeks Board approval to allow management to proceed with the acquisition of
Bol’s share of the Business at the given valuation. Management further seeks scope to
negotiate potential alternative structures with Bol.

Background - Transforming Insurance to deliver value to Post Office

The insurance transformation programme is targeted to increase Post Office’s gross
income from insurance activities from £18 million in 2013/14 to £138 million in 2020 and
net income of £86 million. As set out in the Financial Services strategy presented to the
Board at various times, the program comprises three phases, viz:

. Phase 1 — Titan (new travel insurance model);
. Phase 2 — Exercise buyout option as set out in Eagle;

¢ Phase 3 - Migration of other insurance businesses as contracts expire (e.g.,
Junction).

Phase 1 has been completed with the establishment of POMS. Project Hawk is Phase 2.

Negotiations and the IIE determination
The FSJVA set out a defined process for Post Office to exercise its option as follows:

. Post Office initiates the process with a “market value” offer. This was completed
when Post Office submitted an offer of £20 million in September 2014;

¢ If Bol and Post Office cannot conclude an agreement, Post Office can escalate
to an IIE, who would be appointed by both Parties;

¢ The IIE will determine the price based on representations from Bol and Post
Office. This determination is binding on the parties if Post Office chooses to
exercise the option.

Following the submission of Post Office’s offer, Bol responded in October with a counter
valuation of £100 million.

As it was quickly evident that the Parties would likely be unable to negotiate an
agreement, in November Post Office advised Bol that it would refer the matter to an IIE.
The FSJVA provided for the role of the IIE and set out a clear valuation approach
including timings. In January Grant Thornton was appointed as IIE, working within an
agreed four week timeframe.

The IIE process comprised:
¢ Initial submission by both Parties setting out their valuation rationale:
. Oral presentation by both Parties;
¢ Interview with the Managing Director of the Business;
¢ — Second submission by both Parties;
¢ Questions from the IIE.
At each stage papers were shared with the other party; all Parties attended the interview.

Post Office was supported by KPMG and Linklaters (the same team that drove Eagle),
while Bol retained Morgan Stanley, utilised its corporate finance in-house business and
appointed a leading insurance valuation expert to its team.

The IIE delivered his outcome to the parties to schedule on 27" February 2015:
¢ He determined Bol’s share of the Business to be £43.9 million.

. This valuation is final and binding on the Parties.

Financial Analysis

Whilst the Board granted a mandate upto £40 million, the discussion at the time
discussed a realistic value of £45-55 million. Subsequent analysis by Post Office Finance
has suggested that an even higher valuation would have worked for Post Office. Diagram
1 below sets out an analysis of the theoretical maximum acquisition price Post Office
could pay and see a commercially sustainable return.

This analysis shows the value derived from the various step changes an acquisition of the
Business would enable. Each scenario highlighted below builds on the previous scenario.

« Scenario 1 is based on Post Office simply acquiring the Business and not
developing it. This was the basis of our opening offer to the Bank.

. Scenario 2 shows the incremental value of Post Office undertaking the work carried
out by Budget Insurance Services Limited (“Junction”) from 2017/18. POMS would
take on this role.

¢ Scenario 3 expands the value from the business by replicating, for some insurance
products (e.g., Life), the share of underwriting benefit similar to that being done in
the travel insurance business in POMS.

¢ Scenario 4 builds additional value from new products, which we would only seek to
develop following Hawk (those products would not be commercially or operationally
viable if Bol were still to particulate).

. Finally, Scenario 5 assumes that we can achieve the growth and return that the joint
insurance team has forecast.

In all cases the acquisition of the Business would reduce Bol’s contribution to the
marketing fund by £3.0 million per annum. These funds would be provided by POMS (and
have been assumed in the budget submissions for 2015/16).

The initiative creates a business with a total value NPV of £324.1 million (based on a 10%
discount rate), less the acquisition investment (i.e. net £280.2 million). On a conservative,
risk adjusted basis, the value add NPV of the acquisition is £205.8 million.

Risks

The buy-out of the Business is a key pillar of the Post Office’s Financial Services 2020
Strategy. Its increases the likelihood of the successful delivery of the strategy, and opens
additional opportunities, such as investments (see below).

There remains a risk that the conclusion of the acquisition could be frustrated by Bol
seeking to slow the process. However, the buy-out is a contractually binding obligation as
set out in the FSJVA. Moreover, the Bank has indicated that it is keen to get this process
concluded and focus on the growth of the remaining businesses.

There is a risk that the business transfer will be delayed whilst Post Office develops the
infrastructure to manage it. This risk has been largely offset by the establishment of
POMS and the FCA’s “minded to authorise” letter, which was received on 19" February’.

POMS will need to advise the FCA that its business will grow beyond travel insurance;
this is not an exceptional process. POMS will also need to implement capabilities,
process and controls in order to run the newly-acquired business. The analysis and
process to develop this is underway, building on the existing POMS infrastructure and
capabilities. It is expected and anticipated in the FSJVA, subject to TUPE, that the
existing and experienced joint insurance team will move across into POMS.

Next Steps

Working with Post Office Legal and Finance, Linklaters and KPMG, we will engage with
Bol to conclude the contractual discussions and arrange for the transfer of the business to
Post Office. To start the process and following support from the FS Committee, Post
Office has written to the CEO of Bol advising him that we will be seeking Post Office
Board support to proceed to acquire the Business, based on the IIE’s valuation.

Board approval for POMS to proceed to stand-up as a principal under the FCA regime is tabled separately at
this meeting.

The Hawk team is building a two pillar plan to complete the transaction. As advised by
KPMG's “Integration/Separation, Transaction and Restructuring” partner:

. Pillar 1 will focus on “separation”; acquiring the business from Bol, including asset
transfer (principally novating the existing insurance contracts).; and

. Pillar 2 will deliver the “integration” into POMS. These pillars will focus on people,
processes and services, contracts, assets and IP and technology.

Anticipating that the business will be run through POMS, POMS is preparing itself to be
ready for the business, including ensuring it has all the relevant regulatory, compliance,
technical and commercial capabilities in place.

. Both Post Office and Bol will require assurance that POMS has these in place
before the transaction can be concluded.

With Finance leading, supported by our legal team, we are assessing the most cost
effective and practical financing structure for the acquisition and how to ensure its delivery
into POMS.

Summary

The IIE determination has a valuation of the Business of £43.9 million, which is slightly
above the Board mandate but within the Post Office value-horizon.

The acquisition is a core component of the delivery of the FS strategy.
The acquisition would reduce Bol contribution to marketing by £3.0 million per annum.

Management strongly believes that the acquisition of the Business at this valuation
represents a good investment for Post Office, with a strong NPV.

Management is assessing the appropriate structure and process to acquire the Business
and integrate it into POMS.

Recommendation 1.

Management seeks in principal Board approval to proceed to acquire the Business for
£43.9 million and that the acquisition is incorporated into POMS.

Alternative models with Bol
Subject to approval 8.1 above, management will seek to conclude Hawk.

There are, however, alternative models that could further opportunities. These are
supported by:

° Bol being keen to retain the exclusivity of its relationship with POL. This is both
an optical/market and operational concern;

¢ Bol being concerned at the dilutionary impact on branch and marketing
activities/focus if those activities were split between remaining Bol business and
insurances;

. In 2014/15 the Parties failed to negotiate a commission structure and operating
model that enabled the launch of investment products. While this is a potentially
significant market opportunity for Post Office, the commission proposals from
Bol did not provide an economic return.

Entering the investments market, particularly following the changes to pensions and
annuities that come into effect in 2014/15, presents the Post Office with a significant
income opportunity. As presented to the Post Office Board Financial Services Committee
in June 2014, the 2020 Strategic Plan includes a £20 million income for Post Office; this is
believed to be a conservative estimate of the long term opportunity.

9.4. Preliminary discussions were held in late 2014 to ascertain the interest and value of an
alternative model for Hawk, on the basis of:

e Hawk to proceed;

¢ Bol to gain a small share of POMS (say 10%); this would therefore include a
share of value from the travel insurance business (which is outside the Bol
relationship today);

° Bol would not be able to influence strategy, but certain aspects would require
consent (e.g., acquisition or dilution);

e Utilise POMS as the vehicle to develop the investments strategy, with POMS
engaging directly with the market.

9.5. This opportunity has considerable merits, including
. Significant opportunity from investments;
e Maintaining Bol focus in the Post Office FS business; and

¢ Reduced acquisition investment and retention of the annual marketing
contribution.

9.6. However it also raises a number of issues:

¢ Bol would own part of a Post Office subsidiary and Bol would gain a share of
the long term upside from insurance growth;

¢ Negotiations on this solution could delay Hawk.

10. Recommendation 2.
10.1. Management proposes to:

. Proceed with Hawk as recommended above (8.1), establishing a clear timeline
for completion; and

. Initiate parallel conversations with Bol to determine whether there is a financial
and strategic alignment to proceed further with the alternative solution.

10.2. The Board is asked to note the alternative solution and authorise management to assess
its veracity, while continuing to complete Hawk (as per 8.1 above).

POST OFFICE LIMITED BOARD

Statutory Reporting Requirements for
Post Office Management Services Limited

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

1.1 Request consent from the Post Office Board pursuant to article 4.3(P) of
the Post Office Management Services Limited (POMS) articles of association
(Articles) to a) shorten the Accounting Reference Date (ARD) for the
second POMS accounting period to 30 November 2014 and then b) extend
the ARD for the third POMS accounting period to 27 March 2016.

2. Background - Statutory Reporting Requirements

2.1 POMS as a statutory legal entity was incorporated at Companies House on
25 March 2013. The ARD is 31 March, and it is this date which dictates
when Companies House expects the financial year end to fall and the
financial statements to be prepared.

2.2 As per the above, the first accounting period of POMS was from the date of
incorporation to 30 March 2014. As POMS was dormant throughout this
period, dormant financial statements were prepared and submitted to
Companies House in December 2014.

2.3. If no action is taken, the second accounting period for POMS will be the
twelve month period to 29 March 2015. Preparing financial statements for
this period is not considered to be efficient given that for eight months of
this period POMS was not trading, and only commenced trading in
December 2014. We would incur internal cost and external audit cost for
the preparation and audit of these financial statements.

2.4 As an alternative to the above, we propose to apply to Companies House to
shorten the second accounting period for POMS to end on 30 November
2014, and prepare dormant financial statements (which do not require an
audit) for this eight month period.

2.5 For the third accounting period of POMS we propose to apply to Companies
House to extend the accounting period to end on 27 March 2016 and
prepare active trading company financial statements for this sixteen month
period. These financial statements will be the first to be audited by our
external auditors. Following this the financial period end will always fall at
the end of March in alignment with the parent company, Post Office
Limited.

2.6 This change was approved by the POMS Board on 26 January 2015,
subject to consent being granted by the Post Office Board.

Executive Summary - February

February income was favourable to budget

POCA income

The focus on costs has continued to narrow
the gap - total costs favourable by £10.1m

The £99m EBIT budget is still within reach -
but forecasts suggest £95m in line with the
Board update in January

There are still some critical one-offs to
capture

vesees and cost focus must remain intense to
create momentum into 2015/16

(Cte

Operating profit before exceptional items in the month was £20.9m, which is £11.6m favourable to budget, bringing the year to date
operating profit to £79,6m and reducing the YTD shortfall versus budget to £7.1m (£27.0m adverse year on year, including NSP decrease
of £36.9m).

Net income in P11 is favourable to budget by £1.5m and £12.3m favourable to last year. This is driven by the increase in Government
Services income relating to additional revenue for the new POCA contract of £7.5m. The contract has now been signed so the increased
account charges with effect from 1 December have been recognised this month. This is offset by the continuing shortfall in Mails and Retail
of £4.5m (mainly labels and delayed rollout of ebay returns).

Net income year to date has improved by £1.5m to £54.9m behind budget and £1.3m below this time last year (excluding NSP)

Total expenditure (before project costs) in the month was £8.5m favourable driven by lower subpostmaster costs and staff costs movement
to exceptionals

Total expenditure (before project costs) year to date remains favourable to budget by £52.4m.
The £60m savings task remains challenging but is now all underpinned.
* Subpostmasters’ costs are favourable by £48.2m reflecting lower sales volumes and improved VAT recovery.

* Staff costs are favourable by £1.5m reflecting lower bonus payments offset by under-delivery of savings tasks primarily in Supply Chain
and Commercial.

* Non staff costs are £2.5m favourable driven increased VAT recovery of £12.8m relating to last year and £5.8m relating to this year,
offset by a £10m provision for client compensation, shortfall in savings task delivery, £3.0m for the Mails Segregation penalty payment
accrual and other increased costs including postage.

* Project One Off Costs are adverse to budget by £5.4m reflecting unbudgeted spend for Sparrow and the ‘Journey to 2020’ strategy work.

Cashflow
The cashflow is £31.8m favourable driven primarily by lower than budgeted capital expenditure.

Crown Profit
The YTD Crown profit is £7.6m adverse driven by lower Mails income and higher staff costs as shown on page 6.

Network Transformation

The programme is ahead of plan at P11 both for contracts signed and branches transformed.

Summary Y
Income:

Income is £4.6m less than plan.

At a business level this is predominantly driven by adverse variances in Mails, including Labels, Home Shopping Returns and Lottery, Government Services and Telecoms, with a favourable variance in Financial Services,
There is also an impact of delayed franchising

Line by Line variances are as follows:
Variable sales income is £2.4m less than plan principally due to (i) Mails - Lower parcel volumes, Retail sales and Home Shopping Returns, (i) Financial Services - shortfall from Life Insurance, Home Insurance and variable

Income.

Costs:
Costs are £3.5m higher than plan

Other branch costs are on target.

Fixed income is adverse due to lower than planned LIBoR rates for Card Account commissions.
Retention income is adverse due to a lower customer base and Averaged Revenue Per User for HomiePhone, partially offset by favourable Savings retention income,

Other income is adverse due to the delay or phasing of new products, predominantly Energy. Passport Check & Send (actual income in variable sales) is the other key driver. There was also_a central Financial Services target
that is held here and being delivered. within Financial services variable income

sales of Savings products. There is a corresponding upside in savings retention income due to the income guarantee with Bank of Ireland. Premium Bonds and Mortgages are also performing above target.
Services - predominantly due to higher Passport check & send transactions. However, there is a variance in ‘Other Income’ that partially offsets this due to an element of the Passports target being held centrally in Other

Staff costs £2.2m adverse primarily due to timing of the roll out of Franchising and the impact of the pay review settlement where associated efficiencies are on going, this is partially offset by Crown branch vacancies,
including Financial and Mortgage specialist

Central Costs are £1.3m adverse due to a provision for client compensation, impact of centrally held savings not being achieved, accrual for Mails Segregation penalty and higher postage cost, partially offset by improved
VAT recovery rates. There is also an impact of delayed franchising.

Cost Management update
February 2015

Progress since P10 update
Value and confidence

‘The Cost Reduction Group (CRG) has continued to drive cost management and the in-year
delivery of “line of sight" initiatives amounting to £62.4m (as per P9), although the focus has
shifted to the challenge included in the 2015/16 cost budget.

Original Cost Management Programme £34.2m
‘Additional Cost Challenge to achieve budget £ 6.0m
Central Stretch to achieve budget £ 5.9m
Total Budget Cost Challenge £46.1m
‘Additional Challenge from Q1 EBITDAS gap £ 7.0m
2 underperformance adjustment £ 6.9m
Total Current Cost Challenge £60.0m
Current "Line of Sight” forecast £62.4m
Gap to £60.0m £24m

Delivery and governance
‘The focus has been on driving exisiting projects to conclusion to achieve the in-year financial

targets. 121 meetings have continued to concentrate on a "snagging list"approach to ensure
completion of the initiatives and extraction of the full in-year value.

Strategic initiatives for FY15/16 and beyond

Work continues to define the scope and timing of 2015/16 cost saving initiatives and the impact
on subsequent years.

‘The expectation is now for £120m of run rate cost savings by March 2016, from the original
baseline. This represents an 20% increase from the original £100m challenge and reflects the
ongoing challenging trading conditions in the market.

The favourable variance is mainly due to:

introduced by Santander to reduce fraud (previously there was effectively no limit). This reduced the amount
paid over the counter for Transcash transactions and therefore amount owed to Santander. DVLA is £45m
adverse reflecting reduced volumes. Other clients offset, notably NS&I, UKBA and Payout.

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD

Approval of the 2015-16 Financial Plan and Scorecard

1. Purpose
1.1. The purpose of this paper is to seek Board approval of:
(a) _ the financial plan for 2015-16; and
(b) the KPI scorecard and STIP bonus measures for 2015-16.

1.2. The Board is tolerant of risk-taking which will grow sustainable EBITDAS, seeks
risk that will reduce dependence on subsidies and wishes to ensure that
sufficient funding is always available.

2. Background

2.1. In January, the Board reviewed a draft financial plan for 2015-16. The review and
challenge process was underway but incomplete.

2.2. Income was expected to increase by £15m to £895m. EBITDAS showed a
reducing loss, from £64m to £34m, matching the reduction in network subsidy.
The progress to commercial sustainability was slower than in the Strategic Plan,
which showed break-even in 2015-16.

2.3. The Board challenged the submission, requesting a plan that is realistic and
deliverable. A £10m contingency should be sought through further cost
reductions.

3. Progress

3.1. In addition to a series of specific review meetings, the Group Executive (GE) has
reviewed the plan on two further occasions.

3.2. The GE is recommending a financial plan for 2015-16, which has: income
reduced by £20.5m to £875m, with some mitigation in lower subpostmaster
costs; £15m of additional cost reductions; and which retains the EBITDAS target
at -£34m.

3.3. The changes to income reflected £9.5m of specific amendments. In addition, we
reviewed the plan for underlying optimism bias. We considered a number of
material decision points, noting that the underlying submission reflected the best
possible individual and collective outcomes. We have therefore reduced income
by a further £11m, creating pillar level income contingencies.

3.4. The GE agreed a further £15m of cost reductions, £4m in agents pay and £11m

in operating costs. All of the challenges have been allocated to GE members and
accepted. Some £11m is currently ungrounded.

Financial Plan March 2015

POL-0023949
POL00027308
POL00027308

Strictly Confidential

3.5. The plan shows POL operating within its funding envelope. The headroom at the
end of 2015/16 is forecast to be £320m, compared to a minimum target of
£200m. This assumes planned capital and investment spend of c.£480m. The
main components of the spend are Network and Crown Transformations
(£235m), IT (£140m) and Hawk (£45m). To hit £480m requires ongoing rationing
and challenge against the portfolio of business submissions.

3.6. The slides outlining the recommended plan are attached as Annex A, which is in
the Reading Room because of its length

3.7. A Key Performance Indicator scorecard, including proposed bonus metrics, has
been discussed with the Remuneration Committee and is attached as Annex B.

4. Delivery

4.1. We continue to work on ensuring that the plan is fully grounded, embedded in
the organisation and will be delivered.

4.2. Work is ongoing to ensure that all income plans are absolutely granular and data
driven, by product. On costs, the structure that drove 2014-15 reductions is being
realigned to support next year’s targets: p/I rather than run rate driven and
reflecting the changes in organisational structure. Fortnightly cost challenge
sessions will be held with individual executives and collectively with the Executive
Team

4.3. Aconsiderable amount of work has been undertaken by the Transformation
Director and the CIO to develop a single change plan for the business. This has
largely been completed and the directorates are working through the implications
for their plans. This work is especially critical in a year of limited change through
Horizon, as we move towards replacement. A new, single change governance
process has been established to ration and prioritise access to funding, the
network and the systems.

4.4. The GE agreed that £10m of marketing spend would be held back until
September to ensure that we have the capacity to back the areas of greatest
potential impact in H2.

4.5. We are working through a process to ensure that these targets are consistently
embedded in the personal objectives of the SLP (which make up c.20% of the
potential awards).

5. Realism and Risk

5.1. The Board’s primary concern in January was to ensure that it had a plan which
was realistic and deliverable following the experience in 2014-15.

5.2. The recommended plan is substantially more realistic than both the previous
year’s plan and the draft submission in January. However, the existence of some
income contingency at pillar level should not be confused with a plan that is
prudent or easily deliverable. The contingency is simply designed to mitigate
optimism bias.

The additional cost challenges have been allocated and accepted. These should
be substantially within our control and the business has demonstrated its ability
to take cost out. The Board will want ongoing assurance that the challenges are
being grounded and deliverable but they appear realistic today.

Some significant, potential developments are not modelled in the plan:

« The plan assumes no significant market changes in 2015-16 and no material
changes to competitor positioning. As a result, the Mails business
substantially retains market share. This has been reviewed product by product
and the trajectories appear sensible and have been aligned with RMG’s
expectations.

« RMG has signalled a desire to discuss changes to the 10 year MDA, which
governs our commercial relationship. Anticipating that, as agreed at the
January Board, we have started work to ensure that we understand how the
Mails business needs to develop, with a negotiating strategy with RMG as a
by-product of the work. The plan assumes no material changes in 2015-16.

¢ If RMG wanted to put POL under pressure, it could actively promote online
propositions without contravening the MDA. This could reduce our income by
c. £15m in 2015-16, £30m on an annualised basis.

¢ Following the election of a new government, we expect that a new spending
plan will be required for 1, 3 or 5 years. Our plan assumes no change to the
current funding agreement.

e As ever, the discount rate that exists at the year-end will determine the
pensions charge in 2015-16. We are currently carrying a net £2m risk on staff
costs.

6. Opportunities

6.1.

6.2.

A number of opportunities have been built into the plan:

« Identity verification is assumed to contribute £2m of revenue from a standing
start

e Our plan assumes renewal of the NS&I contract in September at similar rates
to today. This has been flagged as a contentious issue by BIS. If the contract
was not renewed, the impact on plan would be c. £4m

¢ Hawk is assumed to complete early in 2015

¢ Telecoms plans assume that a further price increase is possible in January
2016

¢ Network Transformation enables further fixed pay savings of £10m
(cumulative £22m) and an increase in the variability of costs from 77% in
2014-15 to 81% in 2015-16.

The GE has identified three further strategic opportunities, which do not
contribute materially to the plan, delivering just £2m of planned income in
aggregate. However, they have potential to do more and will be tracked as
though they were part of the core plan. The three are: identity verification
services; additional services for banks withdrawing branches; and additional
opportunities in financial services sales. In financial services, the focus is on
improving online journeys to increase digital income.

6.3. A further commercial opportunity exists. Finally, the business has access to
profitability information which shows the direct contribution, the indirect
contribution and EBIT by product. This has been approved, with minor changes,
by the Commercial Committee and is now being rolled out across the commercial
teams. This should enable us to prioritise more profitable products, review the
portfolio for small, loss-making products that could be discontinued and
challenge pricing/cost structures, debating better outcomes with key suppliers. A
comprehensive review, Product Simplification, has started.

6.4. None of this is straightforward. Many changes would have to be negotiated with
third party clients and the impact on the network would have to be considered
and, if material, agreed. However, it should enable better bottom line outcomes
over time. Direct product contribution should be the primary KPI for commercial
product and marketing managers in 2015-16 scorecards.

7. Reacting to events

7.1. In aggregate, while recent income weakness may continue to play into the early
part of the year and cost challenges still have to be grounded, the plan appears
balanced but stretching. However, events such as aggressive RMG action, a
changing financial settlement from Government or the emergence of new
competitors could take us below plan.

7.2. Inthe shorter term, it will be difficult to manage such changes through additional
cost cutting as happened in 2014-15: the current plans already contain risk. The
immediate option, which reduces over the course of the financial year, is to cut
discretionary spend like marketing, to the detriment of the business.

7.3. A3or5 year plan discussion with Government would take discussions beyond
the current agreement and focus us on any residual, uncompetitive areas of our
cost base. Such discussion may also be triggered by the triennial valuation of the
pension scheme. We have assumed no costs or benefits for fundamental
changes in 2015-16.

8. Three Year Plan

8.1. As a result of structural market changes in Mails and the failure of intended
Government revenue to crystallise, delivery of the Strategic Plan is taking longer
than originally assumed. The Board should debate a number of key questions at
its May meeting and June awayday, including:

e the potential impact of product simplification;

the outturn of the Mails review, with any implications for the relationship with
RMG;

alternative sources of revenue;

the plan to tackle the residual areas of uncompetitive cost;

digital strategy; and

IT delivery, awarding the front office procurement contracts.

eoee

8.2. The Board will be asked to approve: a revised three year plan; and a document
for an incoming government that demonstrates the benefits of the plan, the
returns on investment and alternative options.

9. KPI Scorecard

9.1. The KPI scorecard includes a number of changes agreed with the Remuneration
Committee:

e the financial targets focus on EBITDAS with a lower allocation to income

e a measure of increasing digital income has been included

* cashflow, incorporating the substantial capital and exceptional spend, is on
the scorecard but the Remuneration Committee didn’t consider it should be
bonusable

e the customer satisfaction measure has been split between NPS for Financial
Services and Customer Effort for the whole business. The methodology of the
Effort measure has been improved

e Subpostmaster engagement remains on the scorecard with a view to it
becoming bonusable from 2016-17.

9.2. The business continues to believe that it would be commercially appropriate to
have a threshold measure for income and profit, albeit asymmetric with the
stretch target.

10. Recommendation
10.1 The Board is asked to:

e approve the financial plan for 2015-16, as set out in Annex A.

« to approve the KPI scorecard for 2015-16 and the STIP bonus measures, as
set out in Appendix B.

We know that our currently NPS is over inflated due to the fact that we only carry
out telephone customer surveys at present, and our results are not based mainly on
current account, as with most high street banks.

Throughout 15/16 it is planned to move towards a percentage of our surveys to be
carried out through IVR’s and SMS, where customers will be far more open to be
critical than they are over the phone. For 15/16 we will maintain the telephone only
score while we establish the benchmark for the different approach with a view to
targeting on the new approach in 16/17.

As we increase our current account holdings our NPS score will almost certainly
decline as peoples expectations are always higher of their current account provider
than they are for instance their car insurance provider. (average bank NPS is
between -5 and 5). Maintaining the current score will therefore be challenging.

Our current cross product holding is circa 1.25 and again as we drive this towards 2
and customers have multiple product holdings, their expectations rise and NPS as a
result will suffer.

Our NPS can be split by product, customer type and channel, and whereas we can
mainly influence sales (rather than service and passive) customers and our telephony
channel is mainly run by 3" parties, they all have a brand impact on Post Office
Money so it is recommended that the overall NPS score for FS is used as the
measure.

For comparison, recent NPS scores from other FS providers are shown in the table
indicating that the Post Office score is currently high. As the Post Office develops as
an FS provider, we might expect the score to drop more in line with competitors.

Based on the current trend and planned changes to customer type a suggested
NPS annual target is 25 with a stretch to 27

People - basis for proposed targets

* Employee Engagement
* Target of +1 based on continuing to increase engagement during period of business transformation. The stretch of +3 is
based on hitting the Hay Group external retail benchmark norm (65).
Postmaster Engagement
* Target of +2 based on continuing to increase engagement with postmaster population. We are still awaiting full
breakdown of 14/15 results that will highlight differentiation between transformed branches - which we expect to
achieve higher engagement levels.
« New Starter Turnover
* The measure is calculated as leavers with up to 12 months service vs. total population with up to 12 months service. As

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD

Update on strategic options for the telecommunications business

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

1.1. Update the Board on progress in reviewing the alternative strategic options for the
telecommunications business (telco).

2. Background

2.1. The strategy for telco has not been reviewed in detail since the preparation of the
2013 Strategic Plan — it was not an explicit part of the work done for last year’s June
Board away day, other than to reach the high level conclusion that it was a
secondary pillar rather than one of our core strategic priorities of mails and financial
services. The Executive Committee therefore agreed in November 2014 that a
review should be undertaken of the strategic options available to us for the telco
business, and in particular whether it should be retained as part of our group portfolio
or divested to release capital and reduce management distractions.

3. Activities/Current Situation

3.1. Having lost around 25,000 HomePhone and Broadband (HPBB) customers between
September 2013 and July 2014 as a result of the call centre issues associated with
the migration from BT to Fujitsu, the performance of the business has started to
improve during the second half of this financial year, with a forecast net addition of
5,000 customers.

3.2.A price increase of £2 per month on the Home Phone service was executed
successfully in January 2015, delivering an annualised profit improvement of £7
million. Plans are in place with the network and other distribution channels to deliver
a net increase of 20,000 customers in 2015/16 (taking the total base to 475,000
customers by end 15/16). Together with the proposed £1.00 monthly price increase
from January 2016, telecoms is forecast to generate a direct product contribution
(DPC) in 2015/16 of £15.6m; a £7.5m year on year increase. These growth plans are
supported by c£1m investment to introduce fibre based broadband in Q2 and
develop our internet security product (‘Post Office Safeguard’). The scope for further
price and volume growth in subsequent years is outlined in the next section.

3.3. Our default strategy in the short term is therefore focussed on maximising the
positive contribution the business makes to our central overheads, thereby
supporting our path to profitability over the next three to four years. However,
recognising the challenges we face in remaining competitive in this market in the
long term, we have also started to assess whether greater value could be realised
through a divestiture to a third party. To inform this assessment in November we
commenced a preliminary dialogue with BT and Fujitsu (under NDA) to: a) estimate
the potential market valuation of our business under a full disposal; and b) to assess
whether there is appetite for a franchising or merger arrangement which would retain
a role for the Post Office brand within the telco market, but with a third party taking
on responsibilities for running the business. The preliminary conclusions of this
dialogue are set out in the next section.

3.4. Separate to the HomePhone and Broadband business, our planned launch of mobile
was delayed from November 2014 to May 2015, primarily to improve our financial
outlook this year by reducing marketing spend within Q4. The delay has also allowed
more time for rigorous testing through a friendly user trail with colleagues and
relations. We are proposing to also stagger the roll-out of the mobile launch through
a consumer trial in the North West region, with clear check points in place to review
trading performance before committing to further investment. It should be noted that
mobile will dilute EBITDAS by around £7 million over the first two years of trading
before becoming profitable in year 3.

Options considered and commercial impacts

4.1. Option 1: Retain the telco business and maximise DPC

« The UK telco market is mature and our competitors have far greater marketing
firepower and more compelling bundled ‘quad play’ propositions. Therefore our right
to play in this market remains confined to a limited, value-focused segment,
particularly amongst the over 65s. While we have a relatively strong position (second
behind BT) in the profitable HomePhone only market, this segment is clearly facing
structural decline over the longer-term.

e Nonetheless, as noted in the previous section, telco provides a positive DPC to the
overheads of the business, thereby indirectly supporting our strategic priorities in
mails and FS, and also provides a useful degree of diversification during a period
when we are facing significant structural challenges in the mails market.

e Furthermore, we are projecting a c5.5% annual average customer growth over the
next 3 years and expect the DPC to improve at a higher rate due to continued annual
price increases, reflective of a rational market with BT as a price leader. Under our
‘balanced’ growth scenario, we project gross income to increase from £116m in
2014/15 to £165m in 2017/18, delivering £26m DPC by year 3. This assumes that
we maintain our current price differential and increase prices only in line with market.
We also have the option of reducing the price differential versus BT on HomePhone
in order to maximise the DPC, but with some potential trade off against longer-term
value.

« Telco also places limited demands on the wider Post Office group, both in funding
terms (capex over the next 3 years is estimated at £5-10m) and operating model
requirements. In particular, in the context of the constraints and risks associated with
our IT transformation plans, telco has the significant advantage of being serviced by
an independent technology platform at Fujitsu with limited interface requirements
with Horizon and its replacement system.

¢ The product is also predominantly traded online and through call centres (accounting

for 70 % of projected sales in 2017/18), limiting the demands on the network during
the deployment of Front Office.

4.2. Option 2: Sell the base of customers to a competitor and exit the business

¢ Estimated value £90 million, based upon a market tested price of £250.00 per
Broadband customer and an estimated price of £175.00 per Homephone customer.

o BT is the most likely purchaser of the combined base, as other competitors are
less likely to be interested in Homephone customers. There is a possibility that
we could split the customer base and sell to different parties; in this instance the
likely purchaser of the Dual Play base would be Talk Talk at a small premium,
while BT remain the target purchaser of the Homephone Base.

o The write off of the technology investment in the Fujitsu solution is projected at
the end 2015/16 as £5 million.

° In the event that the Mobile Business is not considered viable, at the conclusion
of the consumer trial, or the Telephony Business is sold, a write off of £7 million
investment is likely.

e Initial discussions with BT were constructive, but were paused in January due to their
EE acquisition announcement and an Ofcom review of the broadband market
impact. However, BT has continued to express interest in renewing the dialogue in
May/June. Fujitsu has not at this stage expressed enthusiasm for either an
acquisition or franchising arrangement, on the grounds that owning a telco franchise
is not part of their core business model (although they remain keen to continue
working with us under the current arrangement).

* — Divesting of the business would arguably reduce management distractions from core
priorities in mails and FS. However, financially the question is whether the
opportunity cost of not disposing of the business to release c£90m of capital is
greater than the £20-30m of annual DPC which we believe is achievable by retaining
the business (we have not identified any material central costs which would be saved
if we no longer had a telco business, and therefore this loss of DPC would be largely
unmitigated).

e At this stage we have not identified alternative investment opportunities which clearly
deliver a greater risk-adjusted annual return and which would only be affordable if we
were to divest of telco. However, this will be kept under review as part of the next
stage of work to refine and prioritise (by pay back) the options for spending against
our limited discretionary investment budget, with a further update provided as part of
the 3 year plan in May/June.

«There is also potential for brand damage should customers feel unhappy about being
transferred to another provider, and also an undermining of network confidence in
the growth aspirations of the Post Office (notwithstanding the fact that 60 % of HPBB
sales are via non-network channels).

* Finally, it should be noted that shareholder approval would be required for a disposal
of telco (both because this is an explicit deviation from the Strategic Plan and there
are specific obligations under the Articles for approval of disposals). Alongside the
commercial considerations, BIS would wish to take account of the potential
stakeholder, network, regulatory and competition implications of such a move.

4.3. Option 3: Franchise the business or merge with another player

« Depending upon the model selected, the Post Office would either earn a modest
franchise fee, based on customer volumes, or would become a minority shareholder
in a merged entity. In particular this could be a value enhancing move for both
parties if one believes the Post Office brand is better leveraged using the capabilities
and infrastructure of a larger player such as BT. During our initial dialogue BT
expressed some potential interest in consolidating our business alongside their Plus
Net subsidiary (which targets a similar value-focused segment of the market).

e This option has the potential benefit of reducing management distraction and risk by
handing over operational control to a better qualified third party, and in financial
terms could release both some upfront capital and maintain a recurrent annual
dividend/royalty payment. (We do not yet have a reliable estimate of the potential
value of these payments, but this is something we will seek to model as part of the
next stage of work, informed by any further dialogue with BT in the summer.)

e While management and operational distractions might be reduced by a franchising
arrangement, we would need to build and maintain an effective framework and
competence for managing our exposure to brand risks through the third party
arrangements. As part of any proposed deal we would also need to assess
arrangements over data ownership e.g. for use in cross-selling into our other product
lines.

Proposal

5.1. Given the considerations outlined above and the fact that we have not (as yet)
received a concrete expression of interest in either an acquisition of
franchising/merger arrangement, at this stage our recommended default strategy is
to retain telco within the corporate portfolio and seek to maximise the net cash
contribution to the overall business over the next three years through the right
combination of pricing, sales and investment levers.

5.2. In practice this is likely to mean keeping the investment in marketing and product
development to relatively low levels compared with industry benchmarks, and
maintaining the price differential vs. BT in HomePhone over the period. The optimum
pricing and marketing strategy will be reviewed ahead of the next expected price
increase round in Jan 1 2016, based on the available evidence at that point and any
regulatory considerations (e.g. the risk that Ofcom could seek to impose a price cap
on line rental). We are planning a line rental increase of £1.00 effective January 1
2016.

5.3. However, recognising that: a) the value of the business in-house is likely to decline
over the longer term; and b) it may be of greater value to a third party with greater
synergistic opportunities, we would propose resuming the exploratory discussions
with BT once the EE regulatory embargo has lifted in early summer, in order to
obtain more reliable estimates of the financial impacts of the disposal and franchising
options outlined above. These updated figures will then be considered alongside our
latest assessment of alternative investment opportunities (including any arising from
further consideration of the ‘Plan B’ options in mails or other areas) to understand
the effective opportunity cost of retaining telco. A further update on this assessment
will be provided to the Board at this point.

5.4. In the event that we do decide that our preferred approach is to divest of the
business, we would also look to increase the number of potential purchasers to
create greater price tension.

6. Key risks and mitigation activities

6.1. Fujitsu’s call centre sub-contractor Capita continues to face both performance and
commercial challenges, which may ultimately lead to the sub-contract being
transferred to another provider. Given the challenges we experienced with the last
migration, clearly any migration will need to be meticulously planned and adequately
funded (by Fujitsu) to ensure the necessary staffing levels and training. We will
ensure Fujitsu are fully aware of these requirements as part of any new contracting
discussions.

6.2. In the event that a decision is made to either divest or merge the telco business,
there is a risk that our homephone customer base in particular will be confused,
leading to an increase in complaints and potential brand damage. This risk should
be mitigated by the fact that the purchaser is likely to have significant experience in
executing these types of migrations.

6.3. In the event that we elect to pursue a more explicit ‘cash cow’ strategy and increase
line rental ahead of the market (e.g. £2.00 vs. an expected BT increase of £1.00),
the total increase over 39 months would be in excess of 50%. This creates the risk of
brand damage which we will need to evaluate in our future pricing decisions.

7. Conclusion

7.1. As set out above, telco has the potential to generate a rising direct product
contribution reaching around £26m by 2017/18. It therefore provides a useful source
of diversification and meaningful contribution to the central overheads associated
with our strategic priorities of mails and financial services, and this is the benchmark
against which alternative corporate portfolio options should be assessed. We will
continue to assess these alternative investment opportunities alongside further work
to validate and quantify the economics of either a disposal or franchising/merger
arrangement.

8. Recommendations
The Board is asked to:

8.1. Note the update on strategic options for telco set out above and agree the proposed

next steps.

Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Post Office Board - March 2015

1. Process

Following the first full Board evaluation carried out in summer 2013, the current Board evaluation
was carried out by the Chairman based on interviews with all Board Directors and the Company
Secretary in January and February 2015. It takes account of feedback from some members of the
ExCo.

The key findings are set out below. The Chairman is separately giving feedback to the individual
Directors on a personal basis.

2. Context

Prior to the beginning of this evaluation, the Chairman had announced her intention to stand down.
at the end of July after 4 years in the role. The SID had also let it be known that he did not intend to
extend his term beyond his 4 year term which would end in the autumn.

Anew CFO had joined the Board in January.
Discussion about the future composition of the Board should be seen in the light of these changes.
3. Overall Effectiveness

In general, the consensus was that the Board was continuing to grow in terms of its effectiveness
and was doing “pretty well” at addressing the right issues in the right way in the best interests of the
business and its shareholder.

The change of CFO provided a very positive opportunity to improve matters further and to rebalance
the respective contributions of the non-executive and executive Directors. The Board should take
conscious advantage of this.

The introduction of the new-style CEO report at the beginning of each meeting, providing an
overview of the business and progress in implementing its strategy, was regarded as a significant
improvement in terms of giving the non-executives an understanding of how things stood, and
focussing the rest of the meeting. The non-executives attached great importance to the CEO owning
the content of that report and opening the meeting by drawing out the key issues from her personal
perspective so that they could support her and her team more effectively.

Several Directors said that it was important for the Board to focus its time and attention primarily on
the issues which are key to the future success of the business in particular revenue growth (eg mails,
financial services and digital). The Forward Look for future Board agendas could be used more
effectively to ensure this happens.

Several Directors commented on the danger of the Board getting drawn into too much detail and
becoming too “executive”. This had often happened where the executive’s contribution on an issue
had not been strong and it was thought that the style and contribution of the new CFO could help
the Board control that tendency where it was inappropriate. It was also suggested that where
individual Directors were particularly interested in the detail of a particular issue, they should be
encouraged to take this off-line.

There is a specific question about how “intrusive” the non-executives should be in relation to
regulatory/compliance matters in relation to financial services on which there are different views
round the Board table. The Board should discuss this.

POL-0023949
POL00027308
POL00027308

A couple of Directors wondered whether the Board had become more risk averse and whether this
was detracting from the need to drive growth. On the other hand, it was suggested that a more
explicit articulation of key risks facing the business eg on a quarterly basis, might be helpful.

Overall, the executives value the Board’s contributions especially on the commercial agenda. The
NEDs were all thought to be well engaged in the business, knowing the key people and talking to
them outside meetings when appropriate. The level of challenge is thought to be right but it was
suggested that the Board could be more forthcoming with praise where it was due.

Many people commented on the dynamic around the Board table which they thought was very
good. There were no “egos” on display; differences were aired frankly and it was felt that the non-
executives did not pull their punches. The best discussions were those where the papers were clear;
had been properly digested by everyone; taken as read; and the non-executives’ questions and
concerns were aired at the outset so that the discussion covered these thoroughly. The Chairman
was recognised as someone who encouraged debate but it was suggested that she could sometimes
bring discussions to a conclusion more briskly.

One Director commented that It was important that there was no loss of energy in the Board in the
period before the current Chairman and SID stood down.

4. Organisation of the Board

Recently, Board agendas had become very packed and energy levels had flagged in the afternoons.
The inclusion of a speaker during the lunchtime session had put further pressure on the use of time.
Several people requested a clear break of at least 30 minutes for lunch. One Director suggested that
meetings should be limited to 4 hours and another that the Board could sometimes meet the
evening before the formal meeting to discuss issues which did not need to be decided formally, thus
taking some pressure off the agendas.

It was generally thought that the Board papers had deteriorated in quality - they were far too long
and insufficiently clear. One Director commented that the volume of papers for each meeting was
about 4 times the volume of papers for other Board meetings attended. It was unclear who owned
the quality of what came to the Board. Further work is needed here.

It was also suggested that the Board might meet in different Post Office venues as it had in the past,
where there was business activity with which it could usefully engage.

5. Composition of the Board

With the forthcoming change of Chairman and SID, it is agreed that maintaining continuity amongst
the remaining non-executives is important for the business. The new SID will need to complement
the experience of the new Chairman so that between the two of them, they cover both the
commercial and the government waterfronts. Given the range of business issues with which the
Board needed to engage, there might be a case for adding an additional non-executive in the longer
run. It would be helpful to recruit to the Board people who had IT and digital skills as well as
knowledge of mails, and to broaden the diversity of the group.

6. Sub-Committees

The Remuneration and Nominations Committees were working well, addressing the right issues at
the right time and reaching clear decisions when required.

POL-0023949
POL00027308

POL00027308

The Audit and Risk Committee had taken longer than had been hoped to get to grips with some
important key issues, such as risk, but progress had been made. The new CFO would put his stamp
on this, and other changes in personnel would help here.

There is an issue, raised below, about the extent to which the ARC should engage in the financial
services side of the business.

Members of the ARC are clear that meetings need to take place face to face rather than on the
telephone and this has been addressed in the planning of future meetings.

The Pensions Sub-Committee had broken the back of its original agenda and in the future, should
not need to meet more than a couple of times a year. But it was agreed that it should remain in
existence and should be accorded appropriate executive support.

The two non-executive Directors on the Financial Services Sub-Committee both take the view that it
should be wound up once the POMS Board is fully up and running under the Chairmanship of Steve
Ashton. They believe that the Sub-Committee falls into the trap of becoming inappropriately
executive; that the current arrangements allow for a lack of clarity about the role of the ARC in
respect of FS matters and that the Sub-Committee is not a good use of non-executive time.

Instead they suggest that post Hawk:-

The POMS Board should take responsibility for all “in scope” insurance matters with updates
provided to the ARC on an agreed basis to ensure that the ARC continues to have a company-wide
oversight of this area of business;

The ARC should take responsibility for non-POMS related FS matters in a discrete section of its
meetings to which at least one Bol representative should be invited alongside Nick Kennet and his
team. Tim Franklin has offered to meet Nick Kennet ahead of each ARC meeting to ensure the right
level of non-executive scrutiny and avoid detailed presentations or discussions.

This issue needs to be discussed and a way forward agreed with all concerned.
7. Issues
The focus of the Board’s time and use of the Forward Look in planning this.

Board members to flag when they think the non-executives are in danger of becoming too
executive.

The Chairman to be quicker on drawing discussions to a close.

The length of meetings and use of afternoons/evenings before the formal Board meetings.
The quality of Board papers and who is responsible for assuring this.

The Board’s role on financial services regulation/compliance.

The future of the Financial Services Sub-Committee post Hawk.

In the longer term, after the appointment of the new Chairman, the size of the Board and possible
widening of skills and experience represented.

CWU on 18" December. The Board discussed the importance of
retaining the focus on Treating the Customer Fairly as well as
incentivising sales and agreed that the ARC should continue to
monitor the FS sales risk measures.

ACTION: (e) The Board recognised the importance of Q4 for ISA sales and asked
Kevin Gilliland the Business to ensure that they had the necessary sales focus in
place.
(f) IThe Board discussed the telephony revenue and asked if the contract
ACTION: had been changed to rectify the revenue/cost disparity for increased
CFO customer usage. The CFO agreed to circulate a note to clarify.

(g) The CFO highlighted that Q3 was the first quarter of the year to deliver
an EBIT above plan and he was hopeful that the Business would be
able to close the EBIT gap further in Q4.

(h) The Board discussed the scorecard and the poor performance on

ACTION: ‘easy to do business with’. The CEO acknowledged the significant

Pete Markey drop against target and last year’s result. It was agreed that a note
would be circulated to explain the change.

(i) IThe CFO explained that Q4 still contained some big one-off risks and
opportunities and that the EBIT could range from £83m to £103m,
although he was comfortable with the £95m currently being forecast.
Likewise the Bonus could range between 12.5% and 70%, with a
current forecast of 50%.

() The Board discussed the Crown P&L target and agreed to the
principle that the initial 373 Crown branches be analysed to produce a
like for like breakeven analysis.

(k) The Board noted the performance and improved full year forecast.
The Board further noted that there were a number of key
dependencies for this improved full year forecast to be achieved.

POLB 15/05 UPDATE ON THE 2015/16 OPERATING PLAN AND THREE YEAR
OPERATING PLAN

(a) The Board welcomed David Ryan, Business Transformation Director,
and Martin Edwards, Head of Financial Strategy, to the meeting.

(b) The CFO updated the Board on the preparation of the 2015/16 Annual
Operating Plan and introduced the proposed approach to the three
year plan, providing an interim update on the latest financial
projections through to 2017/18.

(c) An EBITDAS target of £35m was proposed for 2015/16, continuing the
improvement of the last three years but falling short of the breakeven
target in the strategic plan.

(d) The CFO explained that he believed that the Business was being over

optimistic on revenue, especially in Mails, which had not factored in

ACTION: RMG’s promotion of online postage. He did not think the level of over
Martin Edwards optimism was as significant as it had been in the 2014/15 budget but

POL-0023949
POL00027308
POL00027308

Post Office Limited — Strictly Confidential

he wanted a more realistic approach in the budget and three year
plan. The Chairman stressed the need for realism.

(e) The CFO recognised the need for a £10m contingency to support the
£35m EBITDAS target proposed for 2015/16. This would be built into
the budgets agreed with individual functions. Neil Hayward reminded
the Board that an EBITDAS target of £35m would not hit the LTIP
target, the Business would need to deliver an outturn of £26m to
trigger the LTIP.

(f) I The Board discussed the current risks and opportunities highlighted in
the plan and the need to continue to focus on reducing costs. The
CFO recognised the need to manage working capital to enable the
Business to deliver the plan without further borrowing.

the team down from its current 80 FTEs to circa 60.

(c) David Ryan proposed that the Back Office Application Tower (BOAT)
work, which had been suspended to consider alignment with the wider
back office outsourcing, should now go ahead. The added risks and
cost of any further delay to BOAT outweighed any possible small
advantage. The Board agreed that the risks outweighed any benefits

ACTION: and that the Business should focus on the front office changes. David
David Ryan Ryan would circulate a briefing note to the Board once the final BOAT
and back office timelines were agreed.

Strategy and alignment with Business Transformation; and the key
risks, mitigations and contingency plans.

(b) The Board discussed the changes to the front office system and
Lesley Sewell stressed the need for the front office changes to be
given primacy over all other Business initiatives. It was recognised
that standardising and simplifying products and systems would reduce
cost and complexity for suppliers and risk for the Company. The CEO

products and processes and that the IT strategy was being managed
through the Executive.

(c) A preferred bidder (from Accenture, IBM and CSC) would be chosen
by the end of March.

(d) The Board asked the Business to consider the failures in other

ACTION: Business’ big IT projects to better understand the possible risks; and

Lesley Sewell to report back to the Board on their analysis and its relevance to the
Post Office.

ACTION: sub-postmasters of the system change. The Business was asked to

Lesley Sewell ensure independent assurance of the system’s integrity and security
before it goes live, with a forensic end to end assurance.

ACTION: (f) The Business was also asked to consider how it would manage the

Mark Davies PR implications of announcing the change whilst Sparrow is still

ongoing.

(g) Lesley Sewell explained that the plan was to run the new and old
systems in parallel for 6-7months and the need for the new supplier to
work closely with Fujitsu. The Board asked if the new supplier and
Fujitsu would have back to back contracts to mitigate the commercial

POL00027308

Post Office Limited — Strictly Confidential
risk for the Business. Lesley Sewell assured the Board that this was
the plan but still recognised the Fujitsu exit as a significant risk.

(h) The Board asked how the Business would future proof the new
system and were reassured that this would be as standard a system
as possible, enabling additional ‘plug in’ improvements for software

Assurance, to the meeting and received a request to approve the
Company's Risk Appetite Statement (RAS).

(b) Chris Aujard explained the process used to develop the RAS and the
discussions at ExCo and the ARC. The RAS established the ground
rules for the Business and would help to drive behaviours. Arnout
Vanderveer recognised that it would take time to embed risk into the
Business and ensure that decisions were aligned with the RAS.

(c) Alasdair Marnoch, Chairman of the ARC, acknowledged that the RAS
was a good step forward, albeit that the process had been slow. He

ACTION: was encouraged by the discussions at both ExCo and the ARC and

Arnout Van Der believed the RAS was a good basis upon which to build. He asked

Veer that the RAS, with risk metrics, be presented to the ARC and Board in
May.

(d) Jane MacLeod recognised that the RAS would develop. She wanted
to develop a framework which would mature and change to drive

business decisions.
ACTION: (e) The Board asked that all future Board papers included a risk section

POLB 15/10 MAILS STRATEGY

(a) Martin George, Commercial Director, and Mark Siviter, Head of Mails,
joined the meeting.

(b) Martin George provided an update on the Christmas advertisement

ACTION: campaign and its positive effect on brand recognition and perception.

Pete Markey The Board asked if the analysis could be broken down to understand
the effect on young people’s perception of the Business.

(c) Martin George explained that the Business was still on track to hit the
£342m Mails revenue forecast. He reported the three things in place
to support the sales:

i. The continuing sales support through the guiding coalition,
including focus on the 689 branches that were
underperforming, through remedial plans

ii, An online marketing campaign

iii. I And a branch sales incentive for the last 5 weeks of the year.

(d) Martin George updated the Board on the ‘Win in Mails’ strategy. He
was pleased with the progress on the hand held ingenico devices; the
positive conversations with retailers; and the clear path to a Mails-only
solution in the spring with other products added later. However he had
made limited progress with RMG, albeit they had agreed to work on
trials to look at an improved customer journey, simplified products and
more access points.

(e) The CFO recognised that this was probably the last chance to run a
meaningful trial with RMG to make a compelling case for change.

(f) The Board asked why the Ivy trials had not produced the expected
results. Martin George explained that, although the volumes of home
shopping returns had been lower than anticipated, the trial had shown
the market that Post Office was a viable alternative to Collect+ and My
Hermes. Retailers were now considering Post Office alongside these
other carriers.

(g) The Board supported the idea of a trial but were concerned that the
offer would be difficult to sell to retailers who would want a network
with more consistent opening hours for their customers. The Board

ACTION: agreed that more work needed to be done on the design of the trial,
Mark Siviter with a clear outcome for both the Business and RMG, or there was a
danger of a negative result which might reinforce the RMG position.

(h) The Board were asked to consider the Terms of Reference for

POL-0023949
POL00027308
POL00027308

Post Office Limited — Strictly Confidential

reviewing the strategic options for Post Office in the Mails markets.
The CFO explained that this piece of work was his proposal based on
similar scenario planning in previous companies. It would enable the
Business to understand RMG’s strategy and possible areas of conflict
and alignment. The CEO asked that the work deliver: an
understanding of the RMG operation; a negotiating strategy; and how
Post Office could add value; and some alternatives to working with

RMG.
(i) I The Board supported the proposal and asked the Business to ensure
ACTION: that the work produced tangible proposals which could be discussed
Mark Siviter at the June Away Day. This work should be done without the
knowledge of RMG.

(j) I The Board agreed not to roll out any further Ivy trial outlets prior to the
launch of the full access point proposition in May 2015. Richard
Callard supported the decision but recognised that the Minister would
be disappointed that the Business had not reached 12000 outlets by
March 2015.

(k) Martin George and Mark Siviter left the meeting.

POLB 15/11 NETWORK TRANSFORMATION, MODEL PERFORMANCE AND
CROWN TRANSFORMATION Q3 2014

(a) The Board welcomed Kevin Gilliland, Network & Sales Director, to the
meeting and received an update on Network Transformation,
performance of the new models and progress on Crown
Transformation.

(b) Kevin Gilliland was pleased to report that the Business had already hit
its target of 1650 NT branches opened in the year and was expecting
to have 4000 NT branches by March. He reported relative success
with the guided leaver programme and wanted every office to know
what was happening to their branch before the IT front office changes.

(c) Kevin Gilliland reminded the Board that the sub postmasters’ contract
requires the Business to give 3 months’ notice to sub postmasters but
that the proposed cliff would give 6 months. It was his intention to
have started conversations with all sub postmasters before May. The
September cliff had always been indicative and because NT was
ahead of plan the Business needed to bring this forward to keep up
the conversion rate.

(d) The Board agreed that the term cliff was unhelpful and that the
Business should try to smooth the changes as much as possible.

(e) The Board asked how the NFSP and George Thomson are likely to
react to the change. Kevin Gilliland hoped that George Thomson
would understand the need to bring the date forward but he was
comfortable that this was the right thing to do irrespective of the NFSP
position. The Board noted that the MoU with the NFSP had still not
been agreed.

(f) The Board discussed the Crown Office P&L and getting the 373
branches to breakeven. They recognised that some Crown branches
were still making a loss and that the Business would now deal with
these as Business as Usual. Kevin Gilliland was asked to set new

ACTION: targets for the next 3 years with a specific focus on the untapped
Kevin Gilliland potential in Financial Services.

(g) The Board noted the update, and thanked Kevin Gilliland and his
teams for the Network and Crown transformation results.

(h) Kevin Gilliland left the meeting.

The Committee discussed the specific statements and proposed that
each area had an overarching introductory statement explaining the areas
where there was no appetite for risk, e.g. unethical behaviour or
regulatory misconduct.

The Committee stressed that a definition of vulnerable customers would
help clarify the statements and asked that this group of customers was
treated consistently across all the areas.

Specific comments by the Committee:

i. Customer
The Business was too tolerant of Business as Usual risk to
customers and the Committee thought there should be more
protection for customers.

behaviour should also be considered.

and the Committee, after discussion, were comfortable with the
levels identified.

identified.

legal and regulatory risk. AV stressed the importance for a zero

delete the words ‘that lead to censure’ as they believed the
Business should have averse risk appetite irrespective of censure.
The Business was asked to reconsider the levels identified as the
ARC could not support them

in the averse statement shown in the first bullet, and to rewrite the
rest of this category as positive statements which the Business
could seek to achieve.

asked for a more granular statement for IT services.

vii. Operation

the mystery shopper frequency whilst the results remained volatile.

(c) The Committee raised the level of credit card usage, and questioned
whether the sales process could be Treating the Customer Fairly with
such a high number of cards unused by the customer. JH accepted that
the level was too high and explained that the Bank of Ireland did not have

being reviewed.

the introduction of a cashflow measure. The CEO explained the
Business’ preference to focus more on EBITDAS than net income, to
drive margin and profit. The Committee recognised that EBITDAS
should remain the measure with the highest bonus weighting but it was
felt that the Business should retain the net income bonus target.

The Committee challenged the inclusion of cashflow as a bonus worthy
ACTION: measure on the scorecard, although it was recognised that this would be
CEO an important measure in future years. It was suggested that the CFO be

given an objective to define and start to drive the cashflow performance.

Modernisation

The Committee supported the inclusion of a digital net income measure
to be included in the Commercial Sustainability section of the scorecard.
Both Crown P&L and Network Transformation branch openings were
acknowledged as important targets and the Committee agreed that these
two measures should make up the modernisation scorecard.

Customer

The Committee discussed the proposed customer measures and a
possible additional option which would include three measures Financial
Services Net Promoter Score (NPS), a Business wide NPS and a
Customer Effort Score (CES). The Committee did not support a change
to three measures. After debate they agreed to continue with the FS
NPS and asked the Business to consider CES or Business wide NPS as
the other measure ensuring a sound baseline of data to set the target
against.

People
NH explained that the Business had intended to include a subpostmaster

engagement measure in the scorecard for 2015/16, but that the recent
engagement survey returns had been very low at 25%, and that this may
not provide an accurate representation or a good base from which to set
the target. The CEO suggested that the Business used the People
Engagement measure as proposed but that the Business should
consider measuring the subpostmaster engagement at the point of
network transformation. It was acknowledged that, given the relative

ACTION: large number of subpostmasters in comparison to employees, that the
CEO Business had to develop a way of measuring their engagement. It was

suggested that the People Director be given a personal objective to
(e) develop a measure to be included in the scorecard for 2016/17.

The Committee supported the following measures and bonus weighting
for each for the 2015/16 Scorecard:

Commercial Sustainability

EBITDAS 30%

Net Income 10%

Digital Net Income 10%
Customer

CES or POL NPS 10%

FS NPS 5%
People

Modernisation
NTP branches open 10%

(f) Crown P&L 10%

15/08 PERFORMANCE

(a) The Committee received an update on the forecasted outturn from the
2014/15 STIP and LTIP due to complete in March 2015. The current
forecast would generate a very small STIP payment and a 54% LTIP
performance.

(b) I NH reported that the Crown P&L looked likely to breakeven in September
or October 2015, so the March target would be missed. The CEO
explained that, if taken as a whole, the original 373 branches would
breakeven by March. However, the Crown branches remaining in the
network would miss the target so the scorecard bonus and Crown staff
payments would not be triggered.

Horizon claims Rodric
(aka “Project I Williams

den

Post Office has received various claims from
subpostmasters (SPMs) alleging defects in the
Horizon system and POL’s internal processes.

These allegations were initially made in 5
claims brought through solicitors Shoosmiths.
Similar allegations have been made by the
“Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance” UFSA)
and advanced through SPMs’ MPs.

Following discussions with James Arbuthnot
MP and JFSA, independent investigator Second
Sight Support Services Ltd (Second Sight) was
appointed in July 2012 to carry out a review
into these allegations.

On 08.07.13, Second Sight published a Report
finding shortcomings in Post Office’s internal
training and support to SPMs on the Horizon
system, but no systemic problems with Horizon
itself.

Following the Second Sight Report, on
27.08.13 Post Office launched a Mediation
Scheme (Scheme) aimed at resolving individual
complaints made about Horizon.

This matter is the subject of separate
updates to senior management and the
Board.

The Scheme received 150 applications,
which have been progressed under the
direction of a Working Group comprising
retired Court of Appeal Judge Sir Anthony
Hooper (as Chair), Post Office, Second Sight,
and JFSA. 80 cases are still being
progressed through the Scheme.

On 03.03.15 the Board approved a course of
action by which Post Office would presume
to mediate all non-criminal cases within the
Scheme, the Working Group would be closed,
and the current engagement with Second
Sight would be terminated. Post Office's
project team is acting in accordance with the
Board's direction.

To date, no claim has been made against
Post Office in the civil courts, and no appeal
has been made against any conviction in the
criminal courts, following Second Sight's
Report. Post Office is however _in

Health & Safety Report

Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to:

1
1.2

Provide an update on safety performance.
Outline risk reduction activities.

Current Situation

21

2.2

The majority of accidents fall into three main categories lifting and handling,
stepping and striking and outdoor falls. These are higher frequency events with, in
the majority, relatively low severity. The lower frequency types of incident can carry
the potential for very high impact, for example, assaults and road traffic collisions.

Performance during the past 10 months of 2014/15 indicates that the 5% continuous
improvement target in absence accidents will not be achieved. This needs to be
considered in the context of the overall low number of absence accidents and the
adverse impact that an additional one or two absence accidents per month has on
the overall performance. The severity of those accidents, measured by the number
of days lost, indicates that while volume has increased, severity has significantly
decreased with days lost from accidents well ahead of the target reduction of 5%.
The reduction of all injury accident incidents is currently on target for a 5% reduction
at year end.

2.3 Personal injury compensation claims have fallen significantly in line with the
reduction in accidents that result in sick absence. Comparison with a similar
retail organisation indicates that the Post Office claim rate is significantly lower
in both public and employer's liability and of those claims the ‘denial’ or
‘defence’ rate is significantly higher. The general level of claims is recognised
by the insurers as extremely low both in volume and value.

2.5 The total number of road traffic collisions (RTCs) for the past 10 months is up
39 on last year. While this is of concern it is believed that there continues to
be a more robust approach to the reporting of incidents, irrespective of
severity, and what appears to be an increase in minor damage incidents e.g.
broken mirrors and minor scrapes The number of incidents where the Post
Office driver is ‘at fault’ is also up compared to last year and accounts for
54.5% of the incidents. (Table 3 refers) Road risk reduction opportunities
continue to be the subject of analysis at the Road Risk Forum with a view to
identifying improvement activities in addition to those already in place.
Reversing incidents remain a cause for concern and will be the subject of
additional attention. Injuries as a result of road traffic collisions are extremely
infrequent and road traffic collisions account for less than 3% of the overall
number of injury accidents, however they have the potential for high impact in
terms of injury and loss. Currently the majority of incidents involve low speed
— less than 25mph. Road risk reduction activities are highlighted at 3.1 below.

There was a serious road traffic incident involving a Post Office vehicle on 6"
February as a result of which the driver of the other vehicle died. Indications

26 Robberies involving Post Office Cash and Valuables in Transit (CViT) crews are
down 5 on last year from 33 to 28 for the past 10 months. Physical injuries
during robberies, of which there have been 9, 1 less than last year for the same
period, remain relatively minor in severity. The level of use of firearms remains
consistent with last year with 5 of the 28 robberies (17.8%) enabled by the
presence and/or threat of use of fire arms. There has been one occasion where
the fire arms were discharged (into the ceiling). Support for those affected by
robberies is provided by trained trauma supporters and professional support
resources available through the occupational health service provision. Risk
reduction activities are identified at 3.2. (Appendix 1 — Significant Incidents
refers). Following discussions at the Group Executive H&S sub-committee the
robbery risk assessment and the business’ approach to body armour is now the
subject of a formal 3 monthly review.

2.7 Robberies and attempted robberies on the Post Office network, up to and
including P10, are up 4 on last year to 94 of which 55.3% were successful.
Injuries sustained during robberies are down from 17 to 14. Robberies take
place predominantly at sub post offices leaving Crown branches largely
unaffected. Supporting activities have been introduced to continue to mitigate
the robbery risk and are identified at 3.2. (Appendix 1 — Significant Incidents
refers).

Road Risk

Current longer term activities to mitigate road risk are:

Road risk forum in place to scope and develop road risk reduction initiatives
and activities supported by the risk management division of our insurers
Analysis and deployment of interventions for reversing incidents to mitigate the
increased incidence rates, including yard assessments and technical accident
reduction interventions on new vehicles e.g. Reversing aids to reduce accidents
Analysis and evaluation of data including risk profiling to identify drivers who
need additional support and to determine further generic accident reduction
interventions

Safe driver of the year award to encourage and reward responsible driving
Weekly case conferences to ensure consistent approach to accident
investigation, follow up activity and sharing of good practice

Programme of driving and road risk communications to raise awareness of
current and emerging risks

On site coaching to improve slow manoeuvring skills e.g. reversing

Robbery/Burglary Risk

Current activities to mitigate robbery and burglary risk are:

Active liaison activities with the police to understand ‘at risk’ areas and to
deploy surveillance teams

Increased use of ‘advertising’ on vehicles of new deterrent technologies e.g.
DNA taggant — a solution that contains a unique identifier that is released
automatically in the event of a robbery, spraying those involved and enabling
identification of the individuals involved in the robberies

Trialling new point of transfer arrangements to reduce exposure at Post Office
counters - the majority of robberies take place at the point of transfer which in
Post Office’s is the counter where there is ready public access. The new
arrangements allow for the cross pavement protection box to be emptied / filled
in a secure location.

Significant reduction in opportunities for duress type robberies linked to the
introduction of single person vehicles — single person vehicles eliminate the
opportunities for Supply Chain employee duress type incidents which
historically have been the most violent and likely to involve injury.

Health and Wellbeing

Healthcare interventions:

Second programme of visits to Crown branches, Supply Chain units and Admin
offices to offer health checks using equipment that provides a wide range of
indicators on physical wellbeing. The anonymised data is used to develop
future health and wellbeing campaigns and target interventions.

The programme of visits is supported by an online ‘Wellbeing Zone’ health
check tool as a ‘self- help’ option

Ongoing campaign of communications to promote a range of different wellbeing
issues

Wellbeing events to promote general health, exercise and dietary initiatives
Attendance levels are at 96.5% which compares very favourably with the public
sector and relatively favourably with the private sector

Mental health - A programme of activity has been running for the past 9 months
to raise awareness of mental health conditions and the support available to

those affected and those supporting them. Mental health conditions remain the
single most common cause of longer term absence however related monthly
absence (days lost) is down from a peak of 2274 in P5 to 2185 in P10 and
occurrences are down from 121 in P5 to 106 in P10.
3.4 Safety
The Post Office occupational health and safety management system (OHSMS)
is certified by external auditors to the standards required by British Standard
OHSAS 18001.
4. Residual Risks
4.1 Driving activities have the potential for high impact/loss and therefore remain as
a significant residual risk. However, the actions identified in 3.1 above are
aimed at mitigating that risk and improving performance.

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD

Front Office and Network Tower Procurements: Route to Contract Award

1. Purpose

11.

1.2.

1.3.

The purpose of this paper is to inform the Board of:

* The current status of the Front Office Application and Network Tower
procurements;

«The governance steps that will support the recommendation to award contracts
for the Front Office Application and Network Towers;

«The intent to seek approval to award the Front Office Application and Network
Tower contracts at the Board meeting on 21“ May 2015; and

e The current status of the Back Office Tower following the decision to resume the
procurement.

In addition, we request the Board to recommend non-executive directors (NEDs)
who will work with the Front Office and Network teams prior to contract award,
leveraging their expertise and experience.

Due to the strategic importance and high value of the remaining procurements the IT
Transformation Programme Committee has issued this paper to ensure the
Transformation Committee and Board has visibility of the proposed route to contract
award.

2. Background

2.1.

2.2.

2.3.

24.

25.

IT Transformation is responsible for transforming and modernising the IT services
consumed by Post Office, to support the 2020 Strategy.

The intention is to award contracts for the Front Office Application and Network
Towers in May 2015 as part of the IT Transformation programme (Lean IT)
supporting Business Transformation.

The Front Office Application Tower will provide an enhanced replacement to the
Horizon platform provided by Fujitsu, and will be a key enabler in modernising our
branch experience for our customers.

The Network Tower will replace the current branch and admin network services
provided by Fujitsu (TalkTalk) and BT respectively, and allow us to modernise our
branch IT estate.

The current Front Office Application and Network Tower contracts with Fujitsu and
BT expire in March 2017 and May 2018 respectively, and it is necessary to conclude
these procurements by May 2015 to minimise transition risk and to ensure continuity
of service.

2.6. Given the Front Office Tower is a key enabler to achieving the 2020 strategy, the
governance and accountability for the transformation will be enhanced to increase
business ownership. The Front Office Tower will be set up as a separate Business
Transformation theme, jointly sponsored by Kevin Gilliland and Lesley Sewell. A
strong interface with the remaining elements of IT Transformation will be retained.

2.7. Following the recent Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) review, a decision was
made to resume the Back Office tower procurement.

3. Activities / Current Situation

3.1. Post Office has followed a robust Competitive Dialogue procurement process for
over a year, designed to achieve the best value proposals from the marketplace.

3.2. The process has included two down-selection steps, and as a result, there are three
bidders remaining in each procurement:

e Front Office Application Tower — IBM, CSC and Accenture.
¢ Network Tower — BT, Vodafone and Verizon.
« Back Office Application Tower — Accenture, CSC and CGI

3.3. Bidders on both the Network and Front Office Tower procurements have submitted
their final proposals which are currently being evaluated.

3.4. Some of our government clients (DVLA, Home Office and Environment Agency)
require us to obtain their written permission prior to the appointment of the new
suppliers for Front Office (and Networks).

3.5. The formal requests will be made early May, once Preferred Bidder status has been
identified. Engagement is underway with Government Services to agree the
information that clients will require. We have achieved client support for previous
contract awards; the DVLA provided sign off of the EUC contract, awarded in
October 2014. However, we remain subject to successfully completing the formal
process.

3.6. The Shareholder Executive will be engaged as we progress to ensure that they are
informed and are appropriately involved.

3.7. To mitigate risk the recommended option to ensure service continuity of the existing
Horizon service during Front Office transition will be finalised. We are in discussion
with Fujitsu on options, including the potential for an extension of the Horizon
contract.

3.8. The project team to support the resumed Back Office procurement is currently being
mobilised, and the impact of the delay is subject to an impact assessment.

4. Governance Approach

4.1. Given the importance and value of these services, there is a need for heightened
governance. The programme team has worked closely with the wider business on
finalising the approach to governance, it is critical that key business owners from
across the business are consulted at the appropriate time prior to contract signature.

4.2. A separate steering group, with supporting terms of reference has been established
and is meeting monthly, or more frequently as we mobilise for delivery. This has
recognised and is taking necessary actions to secure a programme director and key
delivery leads, including the end to end process lead.

A plan is being formalised, with support from external specialist expertise to ensure
full engagement across the senior leadership team to accelerate learning and
prepare the business for change.

We intend to involve nominated NEDs ahead of the May Board, leveraging their
expertise and experience to bring challenge and insight to prepare the Board ahead
of presenting the recommendation.

A recommendation on securing continuity of service with Fujitsu will be presented to
Board alongside the recommendation on Front Office contract award so that a full
view of impacts, commitment, risks and costs are understood.

The Board recommendation will be subject to prior approval from the Transformation
Committee and Group Executive.

5. Commercial Impact/Costs

5.1.
5.2.
5.3.

5.4.

The Front Office Application Tower will be worth circa £180m over a 7 year period.
The Network Tower will be worth circa £100m over an 8 year period.

The Network and Front Office contracts are within the delegated authority of the
Board and there is no requirement to go to the Shareholder Executive for approval.

On identification of preferred bidder the business cases will be updated, reflecting
the cost and benefit profile against the overall three-year business transformation
plan. The Front Office business case will include the impact of securing a continuity
of service contingency with Fujitsu.

6. Key Risks / Mitigation

6.1. Risks associated with the on-going procurement and resulting transition will be
subject to Post Office governance, project management and control processes,
and will be escalated to the appropriate governance where necessary.

6.2. Ahead of presenting the recommendation to sign the contract we will provide a
comprehensive update on the critical risks. This will include:

«The Horizon change freeze required during Front Office implementation may
impact other key business initiatives. (Operations Risk — Controlled)

e There is less flexibility in the event of a change of scope or business strategy.
This is because on signature of the contracts, Post Office is committed to
minimum levels of spending in both the Front Office and Networks contracts.
(Financial Risk — Controlled)

¢ — Failure to fully transition to the new Front Office solution by March 2017 may
result in a delay in benefits realisation and significant additional Fujitsu cost
being incurred to maintain continuity of service. (Operational Risk / Financial
risk — Controlled)

e Failure to deliver within the three-year transformation window may have
significant ramifications to the wider business transformation, and require major
funding outside the existing cost envelope. (Operational / Financial Risk —
Controlled)

6.3. In additional, an action from the February Board was to present the lessons learnt
from high profile IT Transformation failures. The resulting paper will be provided as
an annex to the Front Office contract award recommendation. 1

7. Long Term Considerations

7.1. These contracts represent a significant step for Post Office in delivering the future IT
capabilities and achieving specific elements of the 2020 vision:

¢ Acapability to take cost out of the business (not just IT) through efficiency and
process improvements.

« Reengineering of customer journeys to provide the optimum experience for both
the customer and user.

¢ Reducing processing errors, driving a reduction in losses and write-offs.

¢ Looking for a more flexible way to bring on new products, harnessing the new
technology, and making current products more profitable.

8. Communications Impact
8.1. Pre-contract communication will go via legal and the procurement team.

8.2. On contract award there will be communications to the wider market via the official
government procurement channels.

8.3. Discussions continue with the central communication team aimed at developing a
robust stakeholder plan, including sub-postmaster and union messaging.

9. Conclusion

9.1. The programme will continue with a robust management and control approach to
ensure that it complies with the necessary governance to deliver the contract.

10. Recommendations
The Board is asked to:

10.1. Nominate NEDs to work with the IT Transformation programme to assure the
recommendation to appoint the successful supplier;

10.2. Endorse the intent to seek approval to award the Front Office Application and
Network contracts at the Board meeting on 21°t May 2015;

10.3. Note the update and actions set out above.

POST OFFICE LTD

Publication of our Report and Accounts for 2014/15

1. Background and Purpose

1.1 The purpose of this paper is to set out plans for the publication of the Post Office’s
Report and Accounts for the financial year 2014/5. The paper outlines the overall
format of the document, high level messages and tone and explains the development
and production timeline.

2. Approach and style of the report

2.1 Post Office Ltd has now established a track record of producing Report and Accounts
documents to the appropriate standards as a separate company. The 2014/15 report
will therefore follow the same structure as the 13/14 document. The sections to be
included are given at Annex 2.

2.2 The document will display the same professional production standards as last year,
but will take a more functional stance in terms of fewer pictures and it will not include
detailed ‘case studies’. The document will be distributed as a digital pdf. A very
limited number of digitally printed paper copies will be produced for key high level
stakeholders and reference purposes.

2.3 This functional approach will mean that £50k of cost will be saved compared to
previous years (we have budgeted a total production cost of £20k in 15/16 budgets
compared to £70k in 14/15).

2.4 _ Itis anticipated that the Report and Accounts should be ready for external publication
from the middle of June. This will follow Royal Mail Financial Results which will be
published 21 May. Our precise date of publication is yet to be determined and the
accompanying PR and stakeholder plan will also be finalised nearer the time
dependent on the specific environment faced. At this stage, we are expecting to
employ a ‘business as usual’ approach to external media and stakeholders: we are
not expecting to aggressively seek media attention.

3. Tone and key messages

3.1 The document is first and foremost a professional documentation of the year’s
financial results which meets the accounting and reporting standards appropriate to a
listed company. Beyond this it represents a positioning of the company’s strategic
progress to the media and key stakeholders; to internal audiences of staff and
subpostmasters; and to our Shareholder (who will be a new Government following the
May general election). Notably, this Report and Accounts may be the first formal
public positioning of the company in front of a new Government.

3.2 As such, the overall tone of the report should be one of confidence - demonstrating
steady, competent progress in delivering a strategy of change, making financial
improvement and delivering subsidy reduction - whilst being realistic about the
significant challenges in our market and environment. It should demonstrate progress
in delivering a long term strategy by referencing year on year metrics (as required in
financial reporting) rather than internal targetry. The document should demonstrate
that the company has the determination and commercialism to continue to deliver
necessary change.

Against this backdrop, the Chairman’s Foreword can emphasise the long term
progress as a reflection prior to stepping down in July whilst the Chief Executive's
review can focus on in year progress, achievement and challenge — and point to the
continued necessity for accelerating change.

Timeline

An outline of the current timetable is given at Annex 1. The March Board is being
consulted on tone, feel and timescale using a variation on this paper. Content will be
gathered in April. Collation and accounting clearances will be achieved in the first half
of May — leading to the May Board giving necessary approvals and delegations. We
will be ready for the signing of the Report and Accounts in the first half of June.

Finance will collate the figures and the ‘back half of the report (Financial Statements);
Communications and Corporate Affairs will collate the ‘front half. To enable this,
individual Directors will be approached in March to commence the process of

providing and signing off non-financial content for the relevant sections against
templated formats.

Recommendation

The ET is asked to note and agree the approach, key messages and timescales for
the production of the 2014/15 Report and Accounts

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD

Post Office Pensions — Update

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

1.1 Update the Board on the defined benefit pension arrangement, Royal Mail
Pension Plan (RMPP) and the proposed new defined contribution Group
Personal Pension, Post Office Pensions Plan (POPP).

1.2. Note the initial engagement with the RMPP Trustee and their advisers with
regards to the 2015 valuation.

2. Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP) — Background

2.1. Following the transfer of RMPP liabilities to the Royal Mail Statutory Pension
Scheme (RMSPS) and HMG in 2012, Post Office became responsible for
funding its own section of the RMPP.

2.2. As part of the agreement of the transfer, it was agreed to retain the link
between the RMSPS and final salary for Post Office employees still in
employment. It was agreed to set future increases at RPI + 1%. It was further
agreed that HMG would fund this link and £178m was left in the Post Office
section of the RMPP.

2.3. At the valuation on 31 March 2012, the Trustee of the RMPP utilised the same
assumptions used by the Government Actuaries Department (GAD) when
they valued the liabilities that were transferred to HMG.

2.4. Based upon these assumptions, the employer contribution rates and the
investment strategies were set for both Royal Mail and Post Office by the
Trustee. The employer contribution rate proposed was 30.1% of pensionable
pay (compared with 17.1% which was being paid at the time). It was felt that
this higher rate was not economically viable and would put the future of the
RMPP in jeopardy.

2.5. Royal Mail and Post Office examined ways to limit their contributions to the
RMPP whilst providing a degree of certainty for the future of the RMPP. It
was agreed with the Trustee to limit Pensionable Pay increases to RPI (to a
maximum of 5%) regardless of any pay increase an employee would receive
from 1 April 2014 onwards.

2.6. By capping future Pensionable Pay increases it was agreed that the
contribution rate would remain at 17.1%. However, it needs to be understood
that the economic rate the Company should still be paying is 30.1%. The gap
of 13% was subsidised by the assets in the fund. This was possible due to
the money left by HMG to fund the pensionable salary link at a rate of RPI
+1%, with the removal of the 1% created a surplus that would be drawn down
over time. It was projected at the time that, if the assumptions and investment
returns were realised, the RMPP would cross-over into a deficit position by

2021. Prior to this point, Post Office would have to consider the future of its
section of the RMPP.

3. RMPP - Current Situation

3.1

3.2

3.3

Pensions Update

Following an update from the Trustee at the last Pensions Committee
(December 2014), it was highlighted that Post Office might want to consider
its position and support of the RMPP as it was estimated that the deficit
crossover point could be between March 2018 and late 2019, rather than
2021 as initially thought.
The financial position of the RMPP as at 30 November 2014 (this being the
most up to date figures available) is shown below, with commentary on the
key points.
Gilts basis ABO Gilts basis ABO
31 August 2014 30 November 2014
(estimated) (estimated)
Liabilities £176.6m £209.3m
Assets £302.4m £333.6m
Surplus/(Deficit) £125.8m £124.3m
Funding Level 171% 159%
Effective nominal 3.0% 2.7%
discount rate
Effective real -0.4% -0.6%
discount rate
Commentary

The surplus position has remained largely unchanged over the period, with assets
increasing by c£31m and liabilities increasing by c£33m.

The positions include the effect of the April 2012 salary increases assumed in the
2012 actuarial valuation basis (3.5% base increase plus an allowance for
promotional salary increase), as well as the promotional salary increases from
2013 onwards assumed as part of the 2012 actuarial valuation.

The gilt basis ABO measure shown here uses demographic assumptions from the
2012 actuarial valuation basis, market gilt yields and RPI inflation rates. The
RPI/CPI differential is also from the 2012 valuation basis. LPI rates are Mercer
defined.

The figures exclude an expense allowance.

The major contributor to the increase in the liabilities is the significantly
reduced returns in UK government bond yields. Since March 2012 the 20-year
UK government bonds yield has dropped from circa 3.5% to circa 2.3% in
September 2014 (source Bank of England). The impact of this has been
significantly to increase the cost associated with accruing pension benefits in
the RMPP, as they are measured with reference to UK government bonds.

The POL section has a hedging programme in place, however this currently
only extends to benefits accrued to 31 December 2015, and benefits accrued
after this date remain subject to market movements.

The Trustee will be taking the current situation with UK government bonds into
consideration when they determine the assumptions to be used in the
valuation due on 31 March 2015.

4. RMPP — Next steps

4.1. Post Office met with the Trustee and their advisers on 19 March 2015, to
discuss the upcoming valuation. This initial engagement was to set the
expectations and timescales.

4.2. Engagement with the Trustee on the valuation and the assumptions to be
used can have an effect of the economic viability of the RMPP from a Post
Office perspective. The Trustee has an obligation to engage with the
employer when setting assumptions and the Pensions Regulator has set out
the role of the employer with regards to the funding of defined benefit pension
arrangements in its Code of Practice No.3. If we did not engage, we would
risk the following:

e The Trustee setting assumptions that are too prudent and therefore
create a financial risk to Post Office;

« The Trustee setting an investment strategy that is not appropriate for
Post Office section of the RMPP; and/or

« Challenge from the Pensions Regulator should Post Office have to
close the RMPP due to financial viability.

4.3. Post Office will not know the full extent of the financial implications of the
valuation until September 2015, when the initial results will be available. In
the meantime, all possible scenarios will be examined ranging from not doing
anything to closing the RMPP to future accrual. Possible courses of actions
will be presented to the Group Executive in April 2015.

4.4. We are currently developing a risk profile for the different scenarios which
includes key considerations such as industrial relations, employee relations
and the financial risk to the business.

4.5. Given the close link between Post Office and Royal Mail through the RMPP,
and the CWU's longstanding view that separation was not in the best interests
of employees, it would be highly preferable to avoid any changes until Royal
Mail had chosen to do the same. We will be speaking to the Royal Mail
pensions and IR teams in confidence over the next month to understand our
respective positions better.

5. People and IR impact
5.1. I The DB pension scheme is highly valued by — and highly valuable to — our
employees and is fiercely protected by both Unite and the CWU. We are
certain that any move to close or substantively reduce the perceived benefit of

the RMPP would be fiercely opposed by both unions and would likely lead to
industrial action.

Anticipating this risk, we are planning our consultation schedule to avoid DB
pensions coinciding with Crown pay and ‘Wave 2’ of Business Transformation
and adding specialist pensions expertise to the IR team. We would also
invest in comprehensive communications to support affected colleagues so
they had the information to understand any change and make the right
decisions for them.

The current work on pensions is one part of a wider review of staff-related
costs across the business. The People team is currently reviewing all aspects
of pay and reward (including terms and conditions) for colleagues in detail,
working closely with the management teams of Crowns and Supply Chain in
particular. We aim to complete this work in Q1 of 2015/16 so it can inform the
next steps regarding overall pay and reward, and our next steps within both
the Crown and Supply Chain networks.

6.2.

6.3.

6.7.

The name of the new pension arrangement will be Post Office Pension Plan
(POPP).

A 60 day consultation with all employees affected by the change began on 23
December 2014 and ended on 23 February 2015. We considered the
feedback from employees and the Unions before making a final decision to
proceed with the POPP. Unite was broadly positive and this view was echoed
in correspondence to members. Their main issue concerned the governance
of POPP.

As part of the consideration we met with the Unions to gain their support and
discuss any issues they still may have. We addressed the situation
surrounding the governance of the new pension scheme and provided them
with the feedback from employees. It was agreed in principle to the formation
of a joint Post Office and unions governance group. The terms of reference
have been discussed but still need to be finalised between Post Office and the
Unions.

Based upon the formation of the joint Governance Group, both Unions
provided their support for Post Office’s proposal to set up a new Defined
Contribution pension scheme to replace the Royal Mail Defined Contribution
Scheme. It was further agreed to issue a joint statement between the unions
and Post Office demonstrating union support for the proposal. The joint
statement was issued on 17 March 2015.

The implementation of POPP is on schedule, with system changes at an
advanced stage. Given the importance of this project, we are prioritising this
project over other HR SAP changes.

We have worked with our unions and the provider (Zurich) to arrange a series
of presentations to employees joining POPP. These are taking place in
London and Bolton, with Zurich present and both the CWU and Unite fully
supportive and signed up to explaining the changes to their members. These
have already started, with the first union presentation on 9" March and the
first colleague presentation on 18" March.

The Trustee of the Royal Mail Defined Contribution Plan (RMDCP) and Royal
Mail has agreed to allow current Post Office members of the RMDCP with
fewer than 3 months’ pensionable service to take a full transfer of their

‘pension pot’ to POPP instead of the usual refund of a member’s own
contributions.

6.8. We formally notified Royal Mail of our ceasing to participate in the RMDCP
from 1 April 2015 on 10 March 2015.

7. Recommendations
The Board is asked to:

7.1. Note the update and actions proposed in respect of the RMPP set out above;
and

7.2. Note the outcome of the consultation for Project Nemo and the fact that this
project is currently on track as intended.
