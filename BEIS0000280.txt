Congratulations on your move to the DTI, albeit that it was triggered by unfortunate
circumstances.

Tam grateful for the efforts which you have made in the Treasury with regard to the
BA/POCL/Horizon project. You will, no doubt, be briefed about ICL’s involvement
in a number of DTI activities, including the UK Competitiveness White Paper,
Information Society initiatives and — very importantly — as the IT partner for the next
ten years.

I look forward to the opportunity to meet to brief you on ICL and our co-operation
early in the New Year and to discussing how we can further assist you and your
Department in improving UK Competitiveness.

In the meantime, I hope that you will continue to press for an early and positive
resolution of the Horizon issues. ‘This is a project which means so much to the Post
Office, ICL and, indeed, has huge potential for HMG.

Kind regards.
Keith Todd
Yours sincerely Chief Executive
