2.3. AO gave an explanation of the new Post Office Ltd strategy, which is nearing
agreement. It will see a £640 million funding commitment to cover the period
2015-18, subject to State Aid approval, which will see the network continue to
be maintained at its current size and geographical reach, while also providing
for its modernisation. The new funding also sees around a third of the network
designated as ‘Community’ branches, which are those that are uncommercial,
but which provide a valuable social service to the community.
