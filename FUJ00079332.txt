Subject: Cl4 Transaction Mode Problems

We are getting an increasing number of PinICLs on the end-to-end system handling of the new CI4 transaction modes (PT, NAD,
RIAD, ROAD) leading to cash account misbalances and reconciliation errors. These PinICLs are generally being batted about
between the different areas.

I suggest a workshop is set up, led by either Requirements or EPOSS, to present the current end-to-end solution, identify the problem
areas and then agree the necessary changes to achieve a consistent solution. This may involve having to get clarification of
requirements from POCL.

Tfanyone can think of a better approach or that there isn’t a problem please say so.

Duncan
