Imogen

At the end of the Common Issues Trial, the Managing Judge requested two flowcharts: one which explained the
transaction correction process and a second which explained the branch trading statement process. The Managing
Judge also requested that the parties seek to agree the contents of these documents.

Please find attached our proposed flowcharts, and it would be appreciated if you could provide any comments on
these as soon as possible.

Kind regards

Amy
