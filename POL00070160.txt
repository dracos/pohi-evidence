For your information.

Apparently Brown is going to be a problem because it is a case where POL admitted there was a problem with the
system and replaced it. I am hoping that this was a one off event like a power outrage or something of the like. I
will investigate further tomorrow.

Mandy
The two office named Carshalton are 058013 & 144013

Elaine Ridge has had a look back on the EFC and there is no mention on there about any losses being made good
or any issues with the horizon system.

Elaine has also confirmed that there have been no substantial losses at Torquay Road since the temp took over
the office

I have requested that the office files are looked through at Maidstone and will let you know if there is anything in
them when i get a response

cheers

You will recall that Castleton in his allegations has mentioned problems at a number of postoffices. He is calling
Bajaj as one of his witnesses. One of the allegations which Bajaj made was an allegation that POL had paid £4,000
to cover alleged shortages and a dispute at the post office at Carshalton. I know that this is very little information
to go on but can you investigate urgently whether there have been any allegations at that office involving a
payment to settle a claim and in particular is there any information about whether this related to any information
about problems with HORIZON.

Hi Alison

Iam dealing with the complaint that you logged for West End Post Office. I have pulled off the call the PM made
on 11/06/03 to NBSC. The question the PM asked was "HOW ARE POL CHEQUES REMMED OFF THE SYSTEM".
Tier 1 advisor told the pm to reverse the rem out as a voucher to CRU however the call was passed to a tier 2
advisor that gave the pm the correct advise. As the incorrect advise was rectified by the tier 2 advisor on the
same call we would not class as incorrect advise.

I have looked at all calls in June and my colleagues have looked at his cash account and cannot find any problems
with a POL cheque.

The problem seems to be linked to reversals. One call I pulled off dated

11/06/03 the advisor asked the pm to print a transaction log to check if any transactions had been duplicated the
pm told the advisor that the same transaction was showing 8 times he was advised to reverse out the ones not
relevant.

T hope this is OK for you but if you need anything more I have all the calls printed off so I could fax them to you
or just give me ring.
