Hi Mark

I'd really like to go back to Nick today if possible.

Below is the suggested text agreed by Belinda/Mel.

Any questions please let me know.

Ruth

Thank you for your email requesting an interview with Paula Vennells, unfortunately we will not
able to agree to this.

First, as I am sure you realise that it would be wholly inappropriate for Post Office to discuss or
speculate about serious, unsubstantiated allegations about miscarriages of justice in a media
interview.

Second, as you know, the Complaints Review and Mediation Scheme, set up following the
publication of Second Sight's report last year, is underway. Applicants are assured of
confidentiality under the terms of the Scheme. Post Office cannot discuss individual cases
publicly. Nor do we consider it to be in the interests of applicants or the Scheme to discuss
matters which may be the subject of confidential mediation discussions. Having set up the
Scheme it needs to be allowed to run its course.

We of course recognise that there is continued speculation about some of these issues and if
you are planning to run a story, we would like the opportunity to consider providing a statement
or answering specific questions if we can do so without breaching confidentiality or undermining
the Scheme.
