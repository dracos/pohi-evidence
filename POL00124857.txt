Investigation

8)

9)

During investigation the Defendant was given the clear impression that she was the
only sub post office suffering with difficulties. Please confirm how many sub post
offices have undergone some form of investigation, since the introduction of the
Horizon system, arising from alleged losses on the system.

During the Defence visit to the sub Post Office at West Byfleet, the investigating
officer, John Longman, made it clear that it was Post Office policy that investigating
officers should never consider systems problems as relevant to their enquiry. Please
provide details of the reasoning behind this policy.

10)John Longman accepted that there was no Post Office requirement that he should

understand the operation of the Horizon system in order to properly conduct his
investigations. Please provide details of the training given to investigators to enable
them to properly conduct an investigation. Given his lack of understanding of the
system what back up teams does the Post Office have to ensure all reasonable
explanations are considered before a criminal investigation is commenced.
