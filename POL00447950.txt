Postmaster support
policy

Version 5.0
POL00447950
POL00447950

Post Office is determined to reset its relationship with
postmasters and has introduced policies that set out guidelines
on how Post Office should support postmasters, specifically for
use across twelve areas.

The policies stand on their own but should be reviewed in
conjunction with each other. Support teams should have an
awareness of all twelve policies and how they link together.

The twelve Postmaster Support Policies are listed in section
3.2 of this policy and can be found on the hub, here.

applicable), stock items and vouchers as well as a compliance review, to check if mandatory
business conformance and regulatory compliance controls are operating as intended.

2. Contractual Action — the means of resolving a performance matter with a postmaster
through a formal request, most commonly a Written Direction.

3. Contract Performance Issue — A matter that arises where a postmaster is not meeting their
obligations as set out in their contract to the required standard in relation to a material
matter.

4. Contract Performance Rationale (see Appendix 8.1) - A rationale completed by the Contract
Advisor which captures the facts and findings of their review into the matter and sets out the

2 Overview

2.1 Introduction

The Retail Engagement Director has overall accountability to the Board of Directors for the design
and implementation of controls to manage risk in the network’. Risk in the network is an agenda item
for the Risk Committee and the Post Office? board is updated as required.

This policy is a non-contractual document provided for information. It does not form part of a contract
between any postmaster? and Post Office.

This policy forms part of a suite of policies designed to deal with the management of postmaster
contracts and for those teams deploying any aspect of this policy it should be read together with the
Postmaster Contract Suspension and Postmaster Contract Termination policies. These polices can be
found on the hub, here.

2.2 Purpose

This policy is part of a framework that has been established to set the minimum operating policies
relating to the management of contracts with postmasters.

It is important that each postmaster is able to ensure the obligations as set out in their contract are
performed to the standards required and are provided support by Post Office to meet these
standards. Post Office recognises that there will be occasions where these standards are not being
met.

The purpose of this policy is to identify the circumstances where these standards are not being met,
the review process and to outline the procedures to be followed to ensure performance of the
contract, while supporting the postmaster in this process.

This policy is one of a number of policies which provide a clear risk and governance framework and
an effective system of internal control for the management of risk across the Group. Compliance with
these policies supports the Group in meeting its business objectives and to balance the needs of
postmasters, customers, shareholders, employees, other stakeholders (such as the government
departments) and third party commercial partners including Royal Mail.

In this policy, “network” means branches not directly managed by Post Office.
? In this policy, “Post Office” and “Group” means Post Office Limited.

In this policy, “postmaster” refers to a limited company, partnership, limited liability partnership, other entity or individual that
contracts with Post Office for the operation of a Post Office® branch

POL00447950

2.3 Core principles

Post Office has an obligation to its customers and clients to ensure that all branches are providing a
quality of service and adhering to agreed standards. Post Office is committed to supporting its
postmasters in this process.

It is vital that, to the extent reasonably possible, any performance issues are resolved through Post
Office and postmasters supporting and working with each other through the available methods. It is
recognised that formal actions to ensure performance of the contract can be stressful for the
postmaster and may have an impact on the operation of the branch; therefore, formal action should
only be taken where necessary and where alternative methods to resolve the performance issue have
been considered.

Accordingly this policy, and its linked policies, sets out clear and consistent guidelines to ensure that:

e areview is carried out to establish the facts before any formal contractual action may be
taken and that the postmaster is given the opportunity to identify and address any issues of
concern; and

* consideration is given to the postmaster’s circumstances when Post Office is deciding
whether to take formal contractual action.

Post Office will handle these situations in good faith and apply the principles of fairness,
transparency, and professionalism (being the underpinning behaviours of Post Office).

2.4 Application

This policy is applicable to all all Post Office employees who manage postmaster contracts on behalf
of Post Office and defines the minimum standards to control financial loss, postmaster impact,
regulatory breaches and reputational damage in line with the Post Office's Risk Appetite.

2.5 The risk

Post Office is required to review a potential contract performance issue before taking any contractual
action and in doing so needs to:

ensure that any decisions taken in respect of a postmaster contract are not exercised
arbitrarily, capriciously or unreasonably;

* exercise any contractual power honestly and in good faith for the purpose for which it was
conferred on Post Office; and

* exercise any discretion in accordance with the obligations of good faith, fair dealing,
transparency, co-operation and trust and confidence.

f, temporary staff including agency staff, contractors, consultants and anyone

In this policy “employee” means permanent si
else working for or on behalf of Post Office and, for clarity, does not include postmasters or postmasters’ staff.

INTERNAL Postmaster contract performance policy V5.0 Page 7 of 31
POL00447950
POL00447950

Failure to deal with a contract performance issue in the correct manner creates risks for both Post
Office and postmasters, which include (but are not limited to):

e formal contractual action being taken without proper cause or a contractual basis may cause
unneccessary distress for the postmaster and Post Office will not have acted in good faith;

e loss of confidence in how Post Office manages the contractual relationship;

* stakeholders having reduced confidence in Post Office's ability to effectively manage
postmaster contracts;

* Post Office may suffer reputational damage; and
e Post Office may be in breach of its contractual or regulatory obligations.

Section 3.5 sets out the minimum control standards that the Post Office has implemented to control
these risks.

INTERNAL Postmaster contract performance policy V5.0 Page 8 of 31
POL00447950

POL00447950

3 Risk appetite

3.1 Risk appetite

Risk appetite is the extent to which the Post Office will accept that a risk might happen in pursuit of
day-to-day business transactions. It therefore defines the boundaries of activity and levels of
exposure that Post Office is willing and able to tolerate.

Post Office takes its legal and regulatory responsibilities seriously and consequently has:
«  Averse risk appetite to risks around service and support provided to postmasters.

e Averse risk appetite towards risks around our core operational processes that impact
postmasters.

« Averse risk appetite to being non-compliant with our statutory and regulatory obligations.

« Averse risk appetite for financial crime to occur within any part of Post Office or the network.
e Averse risk appetite in relation to unethical behaviour by Post Office employees.

«  Averse risk appetite to risks around disputes and litigation.

e Cautious risk appetite towards the risk of service interruptions that would considerably
reduce branch availability across the network resulting in the inability to serve customers.

Post Office acknowledges however that in certain scenarios even after extensive controls have been
implemented a risk may still sit outside the agreed Risk Appetite/Risk Tolerance. Risks outside of
Appetite/Tolerance may be presented to the relevant governance forums for escalation/agreement of
the risk position.

If a risk is identified which is outside of agreed policy a risk exception note will be required, details of
which can be found here.

3.2 Policy framework

This policy is part of a framework that has been established to set the minimum operating policies

3.5 Minimum control standards

POL00447950
POL00447950

A minimum control standard is an activity which must be in place in order to manage the risks, so they remain within the defined risk appetite statements (as
set out at section 3.1). There must be mechanisms in place within each business unit to demonstrate compliance. The minimum control standards can cover
a range of control types, i.e. directive, detective, corrective and preventive which are required to ensure risks are managed to an acceptable level and within
the defined risk appetite.

The table below sets out the relationships between identified risks and the required minimum control standards in consideration of Post Office's risk

appetite.

4 Procedure

4.1 Contract performance issues

A contract performance issue arises where a postmaster is not meeting their obligations as set out in
their contract to the required standard in relation to a material (i.e. non-trivial) matter. The following
are examples which may, depending on the circumstances, indicate that there is a contract
performance issue:

e — Escalating/continuing discrepancies;

e Not adhering to contracted opening hours;

e Customer complaints, such as failure to adequately deal with customer complaint(s), the
existence of an unusually high level of customer complaints, or of a pattern of complaints
suggestive of underlying failures to meet their obligations. However, the mere existence of
customer complaints against the branch should not be assumed to amount to a contractual
performance issue;

«Branch accounting non-conformance;

e Financial or other irregularities, including possible fraudulent activity (including Fees fraud);

e Breach of contractual non-compete restrictions;

e Failure to comply with legal or regulatory requirements e.g. Anti-Money Laundering
regulations, mails integrity requirements; and

e Failure to meet premises standards.
The contract performance issues procedure is intended to be used for breaches of contract which do
not entitle Post Office to immediately terminate the contract. Very serious breaches of contract which
entitle Post Office to immediately terminate the contract are outside the scope of this policy and are
dealt with in the Postmaster Contract Termination policy®. However, for reference, these may include
(but are not restricted to):

«Where the postmaster is bankrupt or insolvent;

* Where the postmaster is no longer operating the basic business;

« Where the postmaster has been charged on suspicion of a criminal offence (other than a
road traffic offence not involving imprisonment);

* Other breaches which are very serious (“repudiatory”) in nature, which may include:

The Postmaster Contract Termination policy can be found on the hub, here.

INTERNAL Postmaster contract performance policy V5.0 Page 15 of 31
POL00447950

POL00447950

o Where the postmaster has admitted theft of Post Office funds;

© Any action by the postmaster that demonstrates the postmaster no longer intends to
be bound by the contract including loss of a valid property interest;

© Sustained non-compliance by the postmaster following the issuing of written
directions by Post Office; and

o Where a shortfall of a significant value has been caused by the negligence,
carelessness or error of the postmaster, resulting in a loss to Post Office, and which
have been fully investigated by Post Office.

Further details are included in the Postmaster Contract Termination policy when dealing with matters
which may give rise to serious breaches such as the above.

A process map detailing the contract performance process can be found in appendix 8.2.

4.2 Review

Post Office will review a potential contract performance issue before taking any formal contractual
action.

Any review will be a fair and unbiased method of investigating issues identified prior to any formal
action being considered. The process of review allows Post Office to establish facts and gives the
postmaster the opportunity to identify and answer any issues of concern raised.

In the review process, the Contract Advisor should seek further information from the postmaster
through written correspondence (including emails), telephone conversation(s) or a face to face
meeting.

Post Office will ensure that complete records are kept of all reviews and that any decisions taken in
relation to a review are documented in rationale documents. Records will be retained in accordance

with Post Office's document retention policy®.

Details of the review and the supporting records and information willbe shared with the postmaster
unless the material is subject to a restriction on disclosure such as:

e legal privilege;

e data protection law; and

«material relating to a criminal investigation.

® The Document Retention and Disposal Policy (Group Policy) can be found in the Group Key Policies on The Hub

Policy2

INTERNAL Postmaster contract performance policy V5.0 Page 16 of 31
POL00447950

POL00447950

The Contract Advisor should make an asessment whether any restrictions on disclosure apply in
advance of sharing material with the postmaster and seek advice from Post Office’s Data Protection
and Information Rights Team if required.

The Contract Advisor will inform the postmaster of the grounds on which it is being reviewed and its
rights to access information and records relating to the review, as set out above, upon the
commencement of and during the review process.

4.3 Recording decisions

Once a review is complete the Contract Advisor will keep a record of any decision taken, including
the reasoning behind why any decision was taken. This may include preparing a Contract
Performance Rationale document capturing the material information provided by the postmaster,
relevant documentation provided by other Post Office teams connected to the issue, any action taken
by the Contract Advisor and a rationale outlining next steps.

If the matter being reviewed is raised through a Branch Assurance visit the rationale for next steps,
and any contractual action, will be captured in the non-suspension rationale.

Post Office will not take any formal contractual action in connection with a contract performance
issue without ensuring that:

the performance issue has been raised with the postmaster through the most appropriate
team (most commonly the Area Manager) in accordance with the requirements of section 4.2,
with clear expectations having been set and any reasonably required support provided
(including additional training if required). All action taken, including anything agreed with the
postmaster, will be documented appropriately by the relevant Post Office team;

e it has knowledge of the relevant applicable facts and a review of the contract between Post
Office and the postmaster has been carried out to establish that there is a contract breach;

* consideration has been given as to the seriousness of the breach; and

«  ithas considered whether Post Office is itself in material breach of duty in respect of the
matters giving rise to the right to take contractual action (i.e. the contract performance issue).
In line with the Postmaster Contract Suspension policy and Postmaster Contract Termination
policy, the Post Office must not suspend or terminate a contract with a postmaster where it
is itself in material breach of duty in respect of the matter giving rise to Post Office's right to
suspend or terminate (as applicable).

If required, the Contract Advisor can request support from the Head of Contract Management &
Deployment in reviewing the decision.

In circumstances where the review has concluded that there has not been a breach of contract by the

postmaster and, therefore, Post Office will not take formal contractual action, Post Office will write to
the postmaster to advise them of this.

INTERNAL Postmaster contract performance policy V5.0 Page 17 of 31
POL00447950

POL00447950

Following an investigation, Post Office may also decide that even though there has been a
contractual breach, it does not intend to take formal action at this time. In these circumstances, Post
Office will write to the postmaster to advise them of this.

4.4 Review outcomes

Following review the Contract Advisor may take the following steps:

a)

c)

d)

e)

Performance Intervention — the postmaster will be advised that whereas no formal contractual
action is taken they will be reminded of the need to deploy the obligations of their Agreement
and, ultimately what the consequences of not doing so may be. In these circumstances, Post
Office will write to the postmaster to advise them of this and appropriate support to the
postmaster can be offered.

Written Direction - this is a means by which a postmaster is formally requested in writing to take
steps to resolve the contract performance issue. A written direction (using a standardised
template letter) will only be issued, other than in genuine cases where very urgent action is
required, if all of the steps outlined under section 4.3 (Recording Decisions) have been
completed. A written direction will:

outline the breach(es) of contract based on the applicable facts;

give the postmaster a period of time to rectify the issue explaining what is required to do
so. In determining the period of time, regard should be had to the terms of the contract
relevant to the breach and to what is reasonable in the circumstances; and

* explain the consequences of not doing so.

If the postmaster fails to rectify the issue by the time required to do so or indicates they will not
rectify the issue, then the Postmaster Contract Termination policy should be referred to.

Branch Assurance - if the review has highlighted a serious risk either to the postmaster or Post
Office then a Branch Assurance visit may be requested and the steps outlined in the Postmaster
Contract Suspension policy followed, if appropriate.

If a very serious breach (or breaches) of contract are identified as part of the review these will be
dealt with in the Postmaster Contract Suspension policy and Postmaster Contract Termination

policy.

In addition to the action outlined above Post Office may consider further measures to reflect the
nature of the performance issue when considered against regulatory risk to Post Office and its
customers, for example financial consequences (in the form of reasonable costs to undertake
training) and removal of products. Any action taken in this respect will be considered against the
principles and processes as set out in this policy document.

INTERNAL Postmaster contract performance policy V5.0 Page 18 of 31
POL00447950
POL00447950

4.5 Monitoring period

Following a review the appropriate Post Office team will monitor the situation. An assessment will be
made on the length of monitoring period dependent on the individual circumstances but it is unlikely
that this will last longer than 12 months. Should the issue reoccur then the facts will be reported to
the Contract Advisor for them to consider appropriate next steps.

Sustained non-compliance may amount to a repudiatory breach.

4.6 Business improvement opportunities

As part of the review process the Contract Advisor may identify improvement opportunities or
business issues outside of the decisions being reviewed (for example have avenues of support not
offered to the postmaster been identified). In these instances, the Contract Advisor will capture
opportunities on the Contract Performance rationale document and escalate to the relevant team.
These will be monitored and tracked.

5 Where to go for help

5.1 Additional policies

This Policy is one of a set of policies. The full set of policies can be found on the SharePoint Hub
under Postmaster Support Policies.

5.2 How to raise a concern

Any postmaster, any postmaster's staff or any Post Office employee who suspects that there is a
breach of this Policy should report this without any undue delay.

If a postmaster or any postmaster's staff are unable to raise the matter with the area manager of the
relevant branch or if a Post Office employee is unable to speak to her or his line manager, any person
can bring it to Post Office’s attention independently and can use the Speak Up channels for this
purpose. Any person can raise concerns anonymously, although disclosing as much information as
possible helps ensure Post Office can conduct a thorough investigation.
