Audit of Astwood Bank Post Office® branch, Branch Code
346246

Section 1 - Introduction

An audit of the above branch, led by myself, was undertaken on

Thursday 11" Septembe 2008. . The purpose of this audit
was to verify financial assets due to the Post Office® and confirm
compliance with a range of Business processes, procedures and
regulatory requirements.

Section 2 provides a management summary, including the
financial audit result.

Section 3 details a breakdown of the result of the financial audit.
Appendix A details the areas of non-compliance to regulatory

matters and Appendix B details areas of non-conformance
identified during tests of selected policy and procedures. Both

POL00065047
POL00065047

appendices include the actions agreed with yourself during the
closing meeting.

Section 2 - Management Summary

The financial audit revealed a current trading position of £
27,811.98 short, subject to a reconciliation of some figures
(undertaken after the audit). A breakdown of this figure, including
any pending transaction corrections or losses being settled
centrally, can be found in section 3.

Due to findings revealed at audit, and a decision taken by the
Contracts Advisor to temporary suspend you from your role as
subpostmaster pending further enquiries, compliance testing was
not carried out on this visit, therefore there are no appendices
attached.

Section 3 - Result of the Financial Audit

Financial assets to the value of £25,251.46 were physically verified
compared to the amount due to Post Office® of £53063.44.

The difference between these figures is broken down as follows:
£ 27006.01 (-) Identified as a difference in cash figures
£ 109.70 (-) Identified as a difference in stock figures

£ 696.27 (-) Declared discrepancy Wk 24

We arrived at the branch at 8am and introduced ourselves to the-
Postn the Subpostmaster Mr Julian Wilson when he arrived at
approxi ely 8.15 am and advised that we were to perform an audit
on behalf of Post Office Ltd®.

Mi Wilson allowed us access to the secure area, and was present in
the secure area whilst the audit was carried out. _

I contacted the Network Business Support Centre (NBSC) at
approximately 8.15 am and advised that an audit would be performed
at the branch, and that it would remain closed until its conclusion. The
nominated branches offered were: Crabs Cross, Alcester and Studley
and a notice placed on display at the branch detailing this information.

At the commencement of the audit Mr Wilson informed me that there
would be a shortfall in the cash of around £27k. He said that this was
shortages accumulated at the branch over the last 5 years or so. He
had been inflating the cash figures in order that the office show a
balance each month

I produced an office snap shot. The ‘office snapshot’ is a Horizon
generated report that details the cash and stock on hand that should
be present at the time it is printed, in addition to the business
transacted through the branch during a ‘said period’.

I produced a report of the amount of cash declared as on hand by the
branch on the night prior to the audit and noted the cash shortfall of
£27 006.01 after a physical count was undertaken by my colleagues
Kevin Watkins and Faith Lavender.

A shortfall was also noticed in the stock figure of £109.70.

iif Wilson was then advised that he should satisfy himself that the
figures of the audit team were correct. Therefore, we then confirmed
all differences with Mr Wilson and he confirmed the audit shortage.

I telephoned yourself at 8.30 am to report a preliminary suspected
shortage of approximately §27k and that I would ring you back with _
the final figure once I had completed the audit. This I did at 11.00 am
to report an overall she age in the branch of £27 811.98.

1 also notified Graham Brander, Fraud Advisor Team manager and
subsequently Gary Thomas, Fraud Advisor at about 12 noon to relay
these findings.

The decision was then taken to precautionary suspend Mr Wilson at
13.00 pending further investigation.

A final account was prepared and the branch rolled into the next
balance period. The deficiency was put to the Late Account.

An interim manager, Mary Stewart was put in charge at the branch
with all assets transferred to her colleague Sue Wallace on day of
audit.

The audit and subsequent transfer of the branch was concluded at

4.45/pm.

I advised the NBSC that the branch would be re-opening on Friday]
42" September I

No Compliance Tests were carried out at this audit.

Dear Sir

Re Astwood Bank Post, Office
FAD.Codd GRO I

Subject Precautionary Suspension

I write following a recent communication with Donna Evans my NFSP secretary with
regard to the above.matter. .
Thave been asked to tender my resignation which J herewith do but under duress.

Having on three occasions raised the matter, of misbalances, firstly with.my line
manager, secondly in response to a letter from the Federation.and thirdly with. my _
previous BDM but on all occasions no adequate reply was forthcoming.

Regarding the enquiry from the Federation put of the 72 members contacted 66
including myself were experiencing problems of this nature. Somewhat strange I
think!

Thave spoken with other sub-postmasters in a similar situation to myself and find like

them; there are many instances where transactions cannot be checked as to whether \
they were carried out correctly. >

Everybody including yourself has an error margin and on checking, my figures since T

took on the Post Office on a turnover of approx. £45 million my error. margin was

006 %, I

T very much-enjoyed the role as Postmaster and in my time there I increased the I
turnover by in excess of 100% despite the fact that Post Office through no fault of I
theirs lost Government products. I

T cannot help feeling, like others, there is an hidden agenda behind all this and that i
this type of action.is a way for Post Office Ltd to close more offices if not in this I
phase ut in the next phase which will undoubtedly come.

Yours sincerely

Cliesterfield were informed of this some months ago and the help line told me
hoy to complete the transaction as I had not done one of these before.

b) The second amount relates to a transaction that has taken place since my
suspension, and should be therefore taken up with IEL who are running the office
at this time.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir

Re Astwood Bank Post Office - FAD Code 3462463

Followiig my Precautionary Suspension from the above office I wrote to my NESP

secretary on. 2" October 2008 raising several points on which I asked for clarification.

On 15" October I received a reply stating “I do not feel it is appropriate to answer
questions which should be directed to Post Office Limited”.

Lam therefore enclosing a copy of my letter to her for answer by you as the Contracts
Manager for Post Office Limited.

For the attention of Donna Evans -NFSP Branch Secretary
Dear Donna

Further to our various conversations re my suspension there are several items
that I do not understand and they are as follows: -

4. It would appear that as far as PO Lid is concerned you are guilty until you
are able to prove your innocence.

2. Although there would appear to be an appeals procedure this basically
amounts to nothing.

3. Any Financial business has audits on a regular basis including banks so why
does PO Ltd only carry them out on an “ad hock” basis.

4. ‘No other authority i.e. Police, Health, Banks and I would imagine 99% of
‘other businesses suspend people without pay.

5, “Lam not guilty of any misdemeanour other than perhaps not understanding
‘the operation of Horizon correctly. The manuals supplied in a lot of cases are
-not the best. There are clearly systemic problems with the system, which may

be why a “New Horizon” system will soon be installed. Even Post Office Ltd

Even Yost

make mistakes — What about the refunds for Travel Insurance recently. who
ays for that?

6. In your introduction leaflets when taking on a Post Office it clearly states
that training is on an ongoing basis and readily available. You and I know
that PO Ltd do not have the staff to comply with this

7, It seems that having read the “Subpostmasters Contract” everything is in
favour of PO Ltd and nothing in the subpostmaster’s favour unless you get
injured in a robbery.

8. Regarding the Lottery [have had a letter from the agents running the Post
Office and they take no account of the fact that shop staff are operating the
Lottery and basically “tough luck”

9, If Lhad been “up” by £27,000 what would PO have expected then

{joined the Federation on my appointment and the moment I need assistance it
appears none is forthcoming, I would have thought at least there would be some
support form them but apparently not. What happened to people’s “Human
Rights”?

toothless organisation.

Post Office Ltd waste millions of pounds a year and because of this you as an
organisation cannot obtain more financial reward for subpostmasters in all areas
of their business.

For the attention of Mr Glenn Chester - Contract Manager

Dear Mr Chester

Re Astwood Bank Post Office

Thank you for your letter of 29" September unsigned, as was the last communication,

As you received my undated letter on 26" September this should be the date from
when my resignation should be effective.

[understand that my private business will have no claim to the appointment of
Subpostmaster and that the new owner will have to go through the same procedure as
myself.

Lam not guilty of any misdemeanour other than due to a lack of training where
appropriate the Horizon system was used incorrectly.

It would appear that as far as Post Office Limited is concerned you are guilty until
you can prove otherwise.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Wilson

I have been informed by The Former Agents Debt Team at
Chesterfield that the amount of outstanding debt
currently being held at Chesterfield in respect of your
former appointment is £28551.98p. For your information,
please find below a breakdown of this amount:-

£27811.98 Final Account deficiency
£ 500.00 Girobank error 14.05.08
£ 240.00 National Lottery scratch cards error

£28551.98

As highlighted in your letter of 22 October 2008 you will
note that the credit amount of £208.62 has now been
removed from the above statement of debt, as this amount
is in fact proper to the current Temporary Subpostmaster.
With regard to the £500.00 Girobank error, further
enquiries were made on this with the Former Agents Debt
Team at Chesterfield and I have been informed that this
error is proper to stand. A figure of £500.00 was claimed

on the Girobank out-payments line on 14.05.08
but Alliance & Leicester state that no cheque was
received.

The amount of £28551.98 is therefore now proper to be
made good. I understand that when you were interviewed by
Gary Thomas (Fraud Advisor) on 11 September 2008 you
informed him that it was your intention to market the
Page 2 of 2

branch and repay the Post Office® from the proceeds of
any sale.

Cont/
If this is still the case and you are unable to make good
the amount immediately, please can you ask your solicitor
to send me a formal written undertaking confirming that
your solicitor will forward the sum of £28551.98 directly
to Post Office Limited immediately upon completion after
the discharge of the mortgage and the costs of sale and
before any monies are released to you.

I should also be grateful to receive his/her further
undertaking that he/she will notify us immediately if
given any instructions by you to take the property off
the market.

I should be obliged for some general information about
the sale such as the asking price of the property and the
approximate amount of the redemption figure.

I have enclosed an envelope for your reply. Thank you.

Dear Mr Cook

Tam writing to you in relation to a constituent of mine, Mr. Julian Wilson, former
sub-postmaster as Astwood Bank Post Office, Redditch. Mr Wilson was suspended
and then resigned in September 2008 over financial irregularities which resulted in a
£27,000 discrepancy.

Mr. Wilson maintains that he is innocent of any malpractice, and that the Horizon
computer system was responsible. He writes:

“The Post Office ‘Horizon System’ does what it says but with numerous faults. Yes it I
does give a running total of transactions carried out but it does not give details of
individual transactions in many cases so therefore there is no way of checking back to
see ifand where any mistakes have been made.”

T understand that there are numerous other cases of a similar vein across the country, ,
all of which involve sub-postmasters/mistresses accused of financial irregularities but
who claim the Horizon system was to blame. The cases brought to my attention
include: Mr. Noel Thomas of Anglesey, Ms. Jo Hammond of North Hamptonshire,
Mr. Lee Castleton of Bridlington, Mr Amar Bajaj of Chelmsford, Mr Alan Brown of
Falkirk, Ms. Judy Ford of Yeovil, Mr. Alan Bates of Llandudno and Ms Seema Misra
of Surrey, :

I am also aware of reported additional issues with the system within my. own
constituency, and a recent BBC/S4C investigation into the issue which highlighted a
further 30 similar cases.

Working for Redditch, Inkberrow, Feckenham and Cookhill
POL00065047
POL00065047

In light of the alarming similarities of these cases will the Post Office be carrying out
an evaluation of the Horizon system in the near future or indeed be replacing this
system for a more robust and reliable one?

It is indeed troubling that similar issues seem to be affecting a number of post offices,
and over a period of several years. Local Post Offices are the cornerstone of
communities, and I am sure you will agree it is vital sub-post masters/mistresses have
all the support necessary in place to ensure they can provide excellent service.

I look forward to your response detailing how the Post Office will ensure its
computerised are and will continue to be robust, reliable and efficient.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sirs
OUR CLIENT : JULIAN WILSON

We act on behalf of Mr Wilson who formerly held the position of subpostmaster ("SPM") of Astwood
Bank post office ("the SPO").

We are instructed by Mr Wilson in connection with the determination of his SPM contract with the Post

Office Limited (“POL”) dated 6 November 2002 (‘the Contract") whereby Mr Wilson appointed as the I
SPM of the SPO. I

Circumstances aiving rise to the claim.

Mr Wilson informs us that:

On 6 November 2002 he became the SPM before he signed the Contract. Mr Wilson was not advised
to and did not seek legal advice before becoming a SPM. His attention was not drawn to any of the
onerous terms of the Contract (below) which he saw, in the context of the full Contract, for the first
time after hls suspension.

The initial training he received comprised a two day induction course in Worcester. During that
training computer systems were not used and there was no particular discussion of the Horizon
system. Mr Wilson was told he would be expected to balance the accounts but was given no real
indication of what that would involve. Mr Wilson had a short period with a trainer whilst at Astwood
Bank which included only two balancing exercises in the following Wednesdays. On both occasions
the trainer actually performed the exercise and simply talked Mr Wilson through it. Mr Wilson, over 5
years of working as an SPM, managed to raise the income from the SPO from around £38,000 per
annum to around £54,000 per annum. However, like other SPM’s he found the Horizon system
extremely difficult In operation. He had no effective way of monitoring or correcting transactions that
were inputted incorrectly. He observed regular discrepancies in the reports which he considered were
caused by the system itself. He kept records of the discrepancies. He noted a number of occasions
when the extent of discrepancies would actually change whilst the store was closed. So for example a
cash declaration would be made on a Saturday and by Monday the figure would have changed,
sometimes by a figure reaching hundreds of pounds. Mr Wilson raised that issue, and in particular the
possibility of someone remotely accessing his system, with his business development manager Mr
Bridges. He was told in terms the system could not be remotely accessed. We understand that is not
correct. Mr Wilson also experienced difficulties with extended delays within the Horizon system
particularly at busy times, which often resulted in him needing to reboot the system. The system being
used by Mr Wilson crashed completely on two occasions with replacement systems being required.

POL00065047

Mr Wilson attempted to use the helpline on a number of occasions. His experience was that
operatives were often unable to give full advice because they had too many calls to deal with, They
gave him incorrect advice in relation to the processing of business cheques.

In or around May 2003 an audit of Mr Wilson's SPO took place. A small discrepancy was found and
made good by him. Over the next few months the balance figures showed more substantial losses.
Mr Wilson raised this with his [Ine manager, Paul Fantouzi, but was told not to worry as transaction
corrections would put the errors right and no further action was required by Mr Wilson.

On 11 September 2008 a further audit took place. Mr Wilson advised the auditors there would be a
paper shortfall in the region of £27,000. A shortfall of £27,811.98 was identified and Mr Wilson was

suspended.

Mr Wilson was warned of the prospect of criminal proceedings and going to jail, even though his bank
statements demonstrated that he had not misappropriated the shortfall, Under duress, and in
response to a request from POL, Mr Wilson tendered his resignation on 22 September 2008.

On 15 June 2009 Mr Wilson pleaded gullty to two charges of false accounting. He was made subject
to a confiscation order.

A company called Interim Enterprises Limited continued to run the SPO after Mr Wilson’s resignation,
They have suffered similar problems with operation of the Horizon system.

For the avoidance of doubt, itis denied that:

(a) POL were entitled to or had grounds to determine the Contract elther based on the matters
relied upon or at all;

(b) that Mr Wilson was in breach of the terms of the Contract either as alleged by POL or at all;
and

(c) that POL had grounds to prosecute Mr Wilson.

Mr Wilson relies on the fact that he was compelled to make the declarations by virtue of economic
duress and that any offences that arose were therefore a direct result of the unfairness of the system
devised for use by SPM’s as further explained below, and/or as a result of errors generated by the
system itself.

Mr Wilson holds Post Office Ltd responsible for wrongful determination of the Contract by reason of
their: -

(a) Breach of contract;
(b) Further or alternatively their negligence; and
(c) Further or alternatively their misrepresentation.

In addition Mr Wilson will reserve the right to say that in purporting to determine the Contract and/or by
pursuing him to recover the alleged accounting loss and in pursuing criminal proceedings against Mr
Wilson POLs actions constitute misfeasance in a public office.

By reason of these matters Mr Wilson claims against the Post Office Ltd damages for breach of
contract and/or for negligence and/or misrepresentation and/or for misfeasance in a public office.

We have set out below details of the allegations or breaches of contract, negligence, breach of duty,
misrepresentation and/or details of misfeasance in a public office which we believe are relevant.

The Contract was governed by amongst other things the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the
Unfair Terms in Consumer Contract Regulations 1999.
it was an express alternatively implied term of the Contract that:

1. POL would provide adequate training In relation to its systems and in particular in relation to the
Horizon system used for recording and processing transactions (“Horizon”).

2. POL would provide adequate and sufficient system support for Horizon.

3. POL would ensure that the Horizon system was free from defects.

4. POL would provide a suitable, adequate and fair means for dealing with transaction corrections.
5, POL would operate any disciplinary processes within the Contract fairly.

Further the Contract contained onerous and/or unfair terms which were not adequately drawn to the
attention of Mr Wilson including but not limited to:

Section 1 paragraph 8: This purported exclusion clause {s clearly onerous and unfair as it attempts to
exclude compensation for loss of office not matter how caused. It therefore excludes liability no matter
how serious a breach POL may have committed.

Section 1 paragraph 10; The ability of POL to determine the contract at any time in case of non-
provision of Pest Office Services Is onerous and unfair given the an SPM, having completed a trial
balance which shows a discrepancy, has to choose to elther make good that amaunt or commit false
accounting by saying he has made good that amount, in order to be able to trade the following day.
Under this term of the contract an SPM will know that If he does not trade the following day POL can
determine his contract immediately. This means an SPM has no opportunity to investigate the
discrepancy, Further, the ability of POL to determine a contract on 3 months notice, for any reason, is
onerous and unfair given the impact on the investment & income of a SPM if termination of the
contract occurs,

Section 12 paragraph 4: The obligation to ensure that accounts of all stock and cash are kept in the
form prescribed by POL and the obligation to Immediately produce such accounts are onerous and
unfair in that they require the production of records but the Horizon system does not adequately cause
or allow reproduction of records as set out under heading 3 below. Nor does it deal with the situation
where errors In accounting are generated by the operation of the Horizon system itself,

Section 12 paragraph 12: The responsibility imposed on SPM's for losses of all kinds (whether
careless or nol) caused by assistants and the obligation to make good such losses without delay are
onerous and unfair in that they apply regardless of the level of care taken and apply to nominal losses
which do not reflect real losses to POL.

Breaches of the above obligations

1. The training provided was inadequate. There was insufficient focus on the balancing
procedure given the importance of that procedure in fight of the contract terms set out above.
Mr Wilson was shown how to complete the balancing procedure twice but was not talked
through the process himself. There was no training as to how to investigate the source of a
discrepancy. There was Insufficient training in relation to the steps to be taken to regularise
discrepancies when they did occur. We are also aware that the recruitment process for
SPM's appears to have changed significantly. We understand there are now three interview
and a six week training period. Those changes underscore the inadequacy of the training
system previously in place. Given that the transactions completed by an SPM include and
exceed those in a high street bank the training given to SPM's should be exceed that given to
bank cashiers & managers, however it does not.

2. The helpline service provided by POL was unfairly difficult to access due to both Its hours of
operation {in particular stopping the service at 8pm on a Wednesday) and the insufficiency of
operators to deal with the level of demand placed on the service. In relation to the incidents
related above the helpline was unable to provide any assistance, but simply required or
advised Mr Wilson to pay the amounts allegedly owing. It appears that those operating the
helpline were either not familiar with or were instructed not to engage SPM's in relation to

POL00065047
POL00065047

POL00065047
POL00065047

defects in the Horizon system as set out below and were therefore unable to provide any
substantive assistance on a number of the issues arising. Likewise the Area Manager was
unable to provide any substantive assistance when called upon.

3. The Horizon system suffers with inherent defects and/or an unfalr system of operation
Including the following.

It does not allow or cause the production of receipts for certain kinds of transactions including
transactions involving withdrawal of cash using a debit card or post office cash account card,
or when funds are credited to the SPO account as part of a bill payment as a result of a
withdrawal using a debit card or post office cash account card. That in turn prevents or makes
unnecessarily difficult (to the point of unfairness) reconciliation of any discrepancies that arise.
The SPO simply has no mechanism for reconciling the result of downstream processing by
Horizon and POL with what occurred at the SPO either at the tine or when discrepancies are
later identified.

A further problem is that the standard operating procedure for post office counter clerks does
not include reconciliation of bill payment or counter credit slips with the Individual amounts
recorded by the counter clerk onto Horizon. In effect, this standard operating procedure.
makes it impossible for the SPO to identify any failures by POL or the Horizon system in
Identifying or dealing with discrepancies arising from Incorrect data entry.

In effect, Horizon makes it impossible for the SPO to demonstrate that an error has occurred
in the downstream processing.

Further, the system crashes periodically and in a way which does not allow the operator to tell
if transactions inputted prior to or during the crash have been recorded properly or at all. Itis
clear from Information before this firm that a large number of SPM’s have suffered various
problems with the operation of the Horizon system over time due to defects in the system,
which defects POL has never acknowledged or attempted to deal with openly.

The errors set out above were never corrected by POL who simply demanded payment from
Mr Wilson . As far as Mr Wilson knows there was no or no adequate investigation into his
complaints to the helpline. His examples betray the unfair way in which section 12 of the
Contract operates against SPM's. It is also reflective of what we understand to be an internal
policy operating at POL that investigating officers are instructed to disregard complaints made
about defects In the Horizon system during the course of their investigations; and indeed an
internal policy that POL does not Impose any requirement that Investigating officers should
properly understand the operation of the Horizon system in order to be permitted to undertake
investigations and report thereon. Perversely, POL has no incentive to resolve discrepancies
that appear as cash losses at the SPO counter because the Contract imposes personal
liability on the SPM.

There is also an Issue relating to the use of the suspense account upon which conflicting
advice Is given by helpline operatives.

We understand that transaction corrections can take a period of up to and in some cases i
beyond six months to be properly processed. That is plainly unfair in light of the modest likely
financial circumstances and resources of most SPMs when compared to POL, as well as
being an inadequate and insufficient system in the circumstances.

Further and in any event the discrepancy allegedly identified in the audit amounted to an error
of about 0.07% over Mr Wilson's time in charge of the SPO, Such an error should not
reasonably or fairly have attracted the threat of criminal proceedings and/or the termination of
the Contract.

Mr Wilson reserves the right to add to these allegations should court proceedings subsequently be
required.

Further, it is clear that POL owed Mr Wilson a duty of care in relation to the above five obligations. it
is fair just and reasonable to Impose such a duty bearing in mind the power in POL (and in no-one

else) to ensure that training was sufficient, to ensure that support was sufficient, and to ensure that the
Horizon system was free from defects; and the potential consequences to a SPM in the event that
those obligations were not complied with.

For the same reasons as are set out above POL is in breach of that duty of care and those breaches
have led to the losses set out below.

By virtue of the matters set out above Mr Wilson has suffered and continues to suffer loss and
damage under the following heads:

(i) Repayments of discrepancies over time as SPM that POL are unable to prove were as a result
of his or his staff's error .

(ii) Legal fees for Criminal solicitor

(i). Amounts paid under a confiscation order

(iv) Loss of capital investment in SPO and business premises

(v)_ Loss of income as an SPM and shopkeeper due to unlawful termination of contract

(vi) Damage to reputation

Mr Wilson reserves the right to add to this Schedule of Damage and Loss should further details
become available, or should court proceedings subsequently be required. We estimate the current
level of loss to be in excess of £150,000.00.

Please note that Mr Wilson has entered into a Conditional Fee Agreement to pursue his claim for
damages and loss, The GFA is dated 22 November 2010 and provides for a success fee within the
meaning of Section 58 (2) of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990.

While no specific pre-action protocol is understood to apply to this matter, It is Mr Wilson's wish and
intention to comply with the provisions and spirit of the general pre-action protocol prescribed under
_ the Civil Procedure Rules 1998. . .

".. You are asked to acknowledge receipt of this letter within 14 days of the date’ that you receive it, that
Is by 7 September 2011. We strongly recommend that you pass a copy of this fetter to your Public
Liability Insurers, if you have one, as soon as possible. Please confirm to us their detalls and that you

l agree that this matter should be listed for a default hearing as the time to pay has long since passed.

I was under the impression that the enforcement of orders is down to the RART as the Post Office® has not
appointed anyone to lead on enforcement hearings previously. There were assets held under restraint, which
at the time were valued in excess of the order and I am not aware of any applications to vary the restraint
order, so I do not understand why the order has not been paid.
