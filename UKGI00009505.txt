Just to update you.

The company has decided to change the legal team. We’re going to choose between Slaughter & May
and Herbert Smith to run the litigation with a direct mandate from the Board rather than reporting
through the Company Counsel. Their mandate will be to revisit the approach to the litigation (both
substance and tone) — short term that means looking at the appeal relating to the Common Issues trial,
the currently adjourned Horizon trial, and the strategy for reaching resolution.

Norton Rose will be released from the work they have been doing (which hasn’t been very much). So
the legal team will be either S&M or HS, Bond Dickinson (the long-standing firm of solicitors) and the
various QCs that have been retained. We’re open to making other changes depending on the advice

received from the new firm.

We’re expecting the Company Counsel probably won’t stay with the company. The company is
comfortable that this can be managed without significant disruption.

This is a very positive development in my view.

I’m planning to inform the Minister and the rest of the BEIS team after the appointment is made unless
you feel I should let them know sooner.
