M054 — Made decision for mediation applying the new test.

SS state that they will aim to complete the Final CRRs for all those that are due before next week’s
Face to Face WG meeting.

There are potentially 16 cases to be discussed in relation to mediation at next week’s Face to Face WG
meeting. In order to reduce this number SAH requests that POL review the cases prior to the meeting
and give their opinion on which of those should be mediated.

ACTION: POL to review all 16 cases by midday on Monday and provide the WG with their views.

POL to provide hard copies of the CQR, Final CRR, POIR and POL comments for each case they
do not recommend for mediation and take to the meeting.

7. Any other queries raised by Applicants / Advisors

Email from Aver re: M119 — was added to priority list last week due to bank interest in outcome of
mediation. Aver state that it would be helpful if SAH could write a projected time line for the case and
write each month to give a progress update.

ACTION — DO to provide updates to Aver for M119 on behalf of SAH.

8. AOB
Mediation scheme breach of confidentiality — press coverage

CA discussed his email of 10 September in relation to the press coverage on the Part Two report. He
stated that in his view there are two groups of people who could be responsible for the leak, the
applicants or the advisors. CA suggests that if it comes to light that an advisor has leaked the report
then this breach should be reported to their professional body and no funding should be paid to them in
relation to mediation. If it turns out to be an applicant who has leaked the report then we should
reconsider their case in relation to the mediation decision or withdraw their case from the scheme. CA
asked for WG’s feedback the WG agreed this position.

SAH suggested that a letter is written to all applicants and advisors to outline the seriousness of a
breach of confidentiality in relation to the scheme.

ACTION — JFSA to draft a letter which they deem appropriate to be sent to all applicants and advisors
in relation to confidentiality which will be discussed at the F2F WG meeting next week.

JFSA reported rumours from Scheme applicants that Post Office had leaked the Report. CA stated for
the record that Post Office had not leaked the Report.

SS asked if POL’s response to Part 2 is still on track for F2F WG meeting next week. DO confirms in
AVDB's absence that the intention is to issue the response to the WG before next week.

SAH requested that the topic of surpluses on Horizon is added to the F2F WG meeting next week.

ACTION POL to circulate notes on this beforehand.
