Dear Greg
Post Office Ltd v Mr Lee Castleton

There was a procedural hearing at Court on 23 October to review the timetable on this case and set new
directions.

The Master decided that, amongst other things, the trial must proceed in December 2006. Accordingly, it
will commence on 4 December 2006 and will probably last 7 to 10 days. It will take place at the Royal
Courts of Justice, London. Please could you blank out two weeks in your diary starting on 4 December
2006 and keep those dates free for the time being. You will not be required to attend for the whole of that
time and I will liaise with Mr Castleton’s solicitors:

1. To agree that as many witnesses as possible should not have to attend Court to give oral
evidence. This will help shorten the trial and save costs;

2. For those witnesses that do need to attend, we will set up a timetable, so that we can give you
a specific time for when you will be required to be there, to keep the inconvenience to a
minimum.

I will keep you fully updated as and when I hear further, which is likely to be sometime after 10 November
at the earliest, because that is when Mr Castleton will be ready to exchange witness statements.

In the meantime, if there are any particular dates from the two weeks commencing 4 December 2006
onwards when you definitely cannot attend Court, please let me know as soon as possible.

We look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards.

Yours sincerely

Stephen Dilley
