Hi Nick,

Following on from the activity earlier this week and late last, and mindful of future announcements, I
think we would be well advised to prepare for the possibility of a UQ being laid on Post Office
funding.

Please could you use the attached templates to prepare both a rebuttal and answer to put these
together — ideally I’d like to get these in the SpAds weekend boxes and then for Greg next week, but

please let me know if that’s going to be an issue.

Let me know if there are any issues; please use other officials as required.

Cheers,
Rob
