It is a criminal offence to STEAL, DESTROY or damage a

parcel, mailbag, or any other postal packet in course of

Persons suspected of criminal offences will be subject to
investigation which may lead to prosecution in the Criminal
Courts. Heavy penalties, including terms of imprisonment, are
provided for such offences.

Other misconduct which endangers the safety of a mailbag or
postal packet may lead to termination of employment or
engagement or contract with Royal Mail Group.

You shall neither whilst employed or contractually bound by
Royal Mail Group or engaged in Royal Mail Group’s Business,
nor after that employment or engagement ceases, disclose to
any other person, firm or company, or publish or broadcast or
use for your own benefit or for the benefit of a Third Party any
confidential information relating in any way to the activities,
operations or business methods of Royal Mail Group or its
business partners, except as previously authorised in writing
by or on behalf of Royal Mail Group. Any unauthorised

Post Office Ltd will introduce a new Post Office® saving stamp on 16 August 2004. The
introduction by Post Office Ltd of the saving stamp to the list of Post Office® products and
services to be provided in the course of a Post Office® business will require a variation to be

(ii) the Community Subpostmaster'’s Contract

(which enable changes to be made to the relevant Contract),

as of 1 August 2004, Section 23 of the Subpostmaster's Contract, and Section 19 of the
Community Subpostmaster's Contract, will be varied as follows:

(a) the following words should be added to the end of Paragraph 1:
“...except in the case of Post Office® saving stamps which may be
accepted for all Post Office® goods and services, and any other goods
and services that the Subpostmaster has, at his/her own discretion,
decided to allow.”; and

(b) the following words should be added to the end of part (i) of Paragraph 2:
“...except in the case of Post Office® saving stamps and only then where

the Subpostmaster is paying change for a purchase made using the Post
Office® saving stamps and the amount of such change is under £5.00.”

‘The Subpostmaster is informed at the time of his appointment of the classes of
business he is required to provide. He must also undertake, if called upon to do so
later, any other class of business not required at the time of his appointment but which
Post Office Counters Ltd may subsequently and reasonably require him to do, except
that Post Office Counters Ltd may not require him to undertake Mailwork where the
Subpostmaster did not undertake to do so as part of the terms of his appointment.

If Post Office Counters Ltd alters the services to be provided or withdraws a service
the Subpostmaster has no claim to compensation for any disappointment which may
result from the change.

SECTION 3

SUBPOSTMASTERS’ ABSENCE FROM OFFICE

GENERAL

A Subpostmaster, under the terms of his contract, is not obliged to render personal
service and is therefore free to absent himself from the office, provided he makes

suitable arrangements for the conduct of the office during his absence.

He should notify the Regional General Manager on form P2593 when he will be away

for a period of more than 3 days and give the name of the person substituting for him.
A Subpostmaster’s responsibility for the proper conduct of the office, or for any losses
occurring during his absence, is in no way diminished by his absence from the Sub-
Office. He must make proper provision, at his own expense, for the conduct of the
office while he is away, but assistance towards the cost of his own substitution is
provided, in respect of certain absences, under the terms outlined in other relative
sections listed below:-

SECTION 4

ABSENCE ON HOLIDAY - HOLIDAY SUBSTITUTION ALLOWANCE

A Subpostmaster is not entitled to annual leave as such, but subject to the following
conditions he may claim for reimbursement of the necessary cost of his substitution
when taking a holiday. To qualify for reimbursement, the Subpostmaster must be
able to certify that he renders on overage not less than 18 hours personal services each

week.

The reimbursement of the costs of substitution is paid as Holiday Substitution
Allowance and the maxima payable are published annually in Counter News. The
sum reimbursable is the net additional cost necessarily incurred by the
Subpostmaster in providing during his own absence for the Post Office duties which

he normally performs.

To assist Subpostmasters to overcome the difficulties sometimes experienced in
obtaining suitable substitutes in a particular year the holiday substitution allowance
extends over a period of 2 years. The holiday periods for which the costs of

substitution are payable are:

For a Subpostmaster with less than 10 years service; a total not exceeding 7 weeks in a
period of 24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year; 7 weeks for this purpose

consist of 42 weekdays plus not more than 7 associated Sundays.

For a Subpostmaster with 10 years or more aggregated service; a total not exceeding 8
weeks in a period of 24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year; 8 weeks for this

purpose consists of 48 weekdays plus not more than 8 associated Sundays.

NOTE: Subject to the above limits on holiday periods, Subpostmasters may claim

reimbursement of substitution costs for absences of less than 3 days, provided that

claims are aggregated and made quarterly.

6. Proportionate adjustments will be made to the period for which reimbursement can be
claimed when a Subpostmaster qualifies for the higher allowance during the 2 year

cycle.

7. Subject to the limits in paragraphs 3,4 & 5, a Subpostmaster is free to take up to the
maximum of the period for which he may claim holiday substitution allowance at any
time during the 2 year cycle provided that he makes suitable arrangements for the

conduct of the office during his absence. A further cycle will recur in every odd year.

8 The Subpostmaster must do his best to find his own substitute and make all necessary
arrangements for his absence, which should be notified to the Regional General
Manager on form P2593. In cases of difficulty the Regional General Manager or the
Secretary of the local branch of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters may be
able to give the names and addresses of local people known to be willing to offer their
services as holiday relief’s to Subpostmasters. Responsibility for concluding

arrangements with such people remains with the Subpostmaster concerned.

CLAIMS FOR REIMBURSEMENT

9. The Subpostmaster must submit a formal claim for reimbursement of the holiday
substitution allowance on forms P2340 and P2340(A) (obtainable from the Regional
General Manager) within three months of the end of the period of substitution to
which the claim relates, except in the cases as in paragraph 10 where claims should be

submitted quarterly. He must certify:-

9.1 that he has taken a holiday both from the Sub Post Office and from his private

business during the whole period covered by the claim; and

9.2 that in respect of the services he provided as subpostmaster, he has actually and
necessarily incurred additional expenditure equating to the amount claimed, in
respect of a paid substitute or substitutes, payment will not be made in respect
of substitution by family members who work in the Sub-Post Office unless their

involvement is occasional or, if regular, minimal.

Claims for refundment of substitution costs for absences of less than 3 days (see Note
at paragraph 5) should be submitted on form P2340 and P2340(A) at the quarter end,
showing the separate dates of absence and the costs of substitution incurred.

In addition to the arrangement quoted above, with effect from January 1990 all claims
for reimbursement of the cost of employing a substitute for periods longer than 2 days
in the event of holiday or sickness, should be submitted for payment to the Regional

Office no later than six months following the date the claim is made.

Where a Subpostmaster is employed by the Post Office either on a full or part-time
basis, e.g. Auxiliary Postman, it is essential, in view of the terms of the certificate
required as a condition of refundment of the cost of his substitution as Subpostmaster,
that he should be absent from all Post Office work during his holiday as

Subpostmaster.

A Subpostmaster who holds more than one sub-office appointment and who satisfies
the general conditions entitling him to claim reimbursement must also satisfy the
further condition that he is absent from all his sub-offices at the same time, ie.
irrespective of the number of sub-office appointments held, he shall only be entitled to

claim reimbursement for a total period of:-

12.1. not more than 7 weeks in the 24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year, if

he has Jess than 10 years service;

12.2. not more than 8 weeks in the 24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year, if

he has 10 years or more aggregated service.

Only one claim for reimbursement is admissible and not one claim per office held.

Reimbursement of the cost of annual holiday warranted under the foregoing rules will
be suitable restricted in respect of a Subpostmaster’s first and last 2 years of
appointment to amounts proportionate to the actual periods of appointment during

those years; any overpayments which may thus occur will be recovered subsequently.

to 3 occasions in each accounting/ financial year during his own absence on holiday.
On one occasion a cash account may cover up to 3 weeks transactions, and on two
additional occasions 2 weeks transactions. Alternatively, on two occasions a cash
account may cover up to 3 weeks transactions. In no circumstances may two

occasions be consecutive.

Applications to dispense with cash accounts should be made on form P2639, to
Regional General Managers at least 2 weeks before the date of absence, but they can
only be allowed when the 2 or 3 weeks involved fall within the same accounting

period. (The accounting periods are shown in front of the cash book).

“Despatch of Accounts” instructions to cover the period concerned will be supplied
by FC4.3/CAG Chesterfield and for Scotland, Scottish Accounting Office ADI.

of them, or the next account that would be due, is for longer than a normal cash
account week, e.g. Christmas and New Year. However, applications to dispense with

one account at such times will be considered.

Where a cash account is prepared during the Subpostmaster’s absence on holiday and
is signed by a substitute on his behalf, a note to this effect should be made on the

Account.

which he proposes to make for the conduct of the work of the sub-office in his

absence.

Office is temporarily closed on account of the absence of the Subpostmaster on jury

service, the scale payment for the period of the closure will be withheld.

Subpostmasters attending for jury service should claim from the court any allowances
for which they are eligible in respect of travelling and subsistence and, where
appropriate, compensation for loss of remuneration. If a Subpostmaster is in need of
advice of the allowances to which he will be entitled, he should seek it from the

SECTION 7

SUBPOSTMASTER’S SICK ABSENCE SCHEME - SUBSTITUTION ALLOWANCE

1. A Subpostmaster is not required to give personal service and is not entitled to sick
leave as such. However, subject to certain conditions and limitations described
below, he is entitled to claim sick absence substitution allowance, in respect of the
costs of substitution necessarily incurred, when he is absent from his sub-office

through illness.

CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS.

2. With the exception of women over 65 and men over 70 years of age, all
Subpostmasters who give 18 hours or more personal service a week, who are absent
from their sub-office through illness, are eligible to claim Sick Absence Substitution
Allowance. The maxima rates payable are published from time to time in Counter
News. The allowance is payable subject to, and in accordance with, the following

conditions:-

3. The allowance will be payable when the period of any continuous sick absence
amounts to three weeks (21 days including Sundays) or more and it will be paid

retrospectively for all but the first week (seven days including Sunday) of absence.

4. Payment of the allowance will be limited to an aggregated period of 13 weeks (91 days
including not more than 13 associated Sundays) in any consecutive period of 12

months.

5. Where a Subpostmaster is incapacitated by an accident or illness which results, or is
likely to result, in a continuous absence beyond 13 weeks, Regional General Managers
may authorise payment of the allowance to be extended up to a maximum period of
26 weeks (182 days including not more than 26 associated Sundays) in any one period
of 12 months. Where a Subpostmaster has already received up to 12 weeks of the Sick
Absence Substitution Allowance entitlement in the previous 12 months he may,
because of an absence resulting from an extended illness, be entitled to an allowance

up to a maxinuum of 26 weeks in any one period of 12 months.

10.

Where a Subpostmaster’s period of reimbursement of sick absence substitution costs
is extended beyond 13 continuous weeks, such extension will be reviewed
periodically. Under no circumstances will a Subpostmaster be allowed to aggregate

separate periods of sick absence beyond 13 weeks in any one period of 12 months.

The maximum allowance payable will be the total amount calculated by applying the
Subpostmaster’s appropriate Holiday Substitution Allowance rate for the period for
which sick absence allowance is payable, or the actual additional costs of substitution

incurred for the same period, whichever is less.

The maximum amount of the allowance for the period of absence for which an
allowance is payable will be abated, where applicable, by the statutory national
insurance sickness benefit or maternity allowance and earnings related supplement
received by the claimant in respect of the same period. Details of these are recorded
on DSS forms BS12 and BF168 which should accompany the Subpostmaster’s claim for
the substitution allowance (see paragraph 10), Where however, a Subpostmistress
receives a NHS Maternity Grant, the substitution allowance should not be reduced by

the amount of that grant.

(NOTE: Statutory national insurance sickness benefit means that benefit which is
payable to a person otherwise than in respect of another person who is a child or an
adult dependent.) Where a Subpostmaster is not eligible for DSS benefits, a medical

certificate should accompany the claim for payment of the substitution allowance.

Subpostmasters holding more than one Sub-Office appointment will be entitled to

claim the allowance in respect of only one appointment.

Any Subpostmaster who qualifies for the sick absence substitution allowance and can
produce evidence to show that substitution costs were incurred should submit a claim
to the Regional General Manager after he has been absent for three weeks. Thereafter
he should claim the allowance at the end of each subsequent period of absence of four
weeks (or at the end of the period of absence if that is reached earlier). Claim forms

will be supplied by the Regional General Manager on request.

PERIODS OF SICK ABSENCE OF LESS THAN 3 WEEKS

1.

Where an eligible Subpostmaster as defined above is absent sick for a period of less
than three weeks, and does nat qualify for payment of the sick absence substitution
allowance, he will be free to claim, in respect of any substitute for him, Holiday
Substitution Allowance for the period of absence up to the limit of any outstanding
balance of his HSA entitlement. Form P2340 and P2340(A) should be used by
Subpostmasters when making these claims. The amounts payable will not be the
subject to abatement of any national insurance sickness benefit received. Any period
of sick absence for which HSA {as distinct from Sick Absence Substitution Allowance)

is paid will count against HSA entitlement.

SECTION 8

STATUTORY SICK PAY SCHEME

INTRODUCTION

1 Under the terms of the Social Security and Housing Benefits Act 1982 employers are
responsible for statutory sick pay arrangements in respect of their employees. An
employee is interpreted as including office holders who receive emoluments liable for
income tax under Schedule E. Subpostmasters come within this category and
consequently Post Office Counters Ltd is obliged to comply with the conditions of the
Act.

2. The use of the words “employee” and “employer” are used in the context of this
particular piece of legislation and do not in any way alter the Subpostmaster’s status

as an independent contractor.

GENERAL

3. Under the terms of the Scheme most Subpostmasters will not get State sickness benefit
for their first twenty eight weeks of sickness in each tax year. Instead they will get
Statutory Sick Pay, known as SSP, from Post Office Counters Ltd. SSP is paid at a flat
rate. There are 2 weekly rates and eligibility depends on an employee's average
earnings over a specified period. There are no allowances for dependants. SSP is

taxable and subject to NI contributions.

EXCLUSIONS

4. A Subpostmaster will not get statutory sick pay if he comes within one of the
following groups. Ifa Subpostmaster falls within one of these groups he should still

notify his Regional General Manager about his sickness.

Counters Ltd in a tax year in any one period of incapacity for work (referred to
as PIW)(linked or unlinked);

(b) his linked PIW with Post Office Counters Ltd has run for 3 years;
(c) she is pregnant and reaches the “disqualifying period”;

certificates of incapacity;

(g) he is taken into legal custody.

QUALIFYING CONDITIONS,

5. Statutory Sick Pay can only be paid for qualifying days. It has been agreed with the
National Federation of Sub-Postmasters that qualifying days for Subpostmasters will
be those days they are normally required to provide the services detailed in Section 1
of this contract. Where Subpostmasters are required to give services for only part of
the day, that day will count in full for statutory sick pay purposes. For the majority of
Subpostmasters there will be six qualifying days in each week (Monday to Saturday).
if a Subpostmaster is in doubt about which days are regarded as qualifying days he

should seek confirmation from his Regional General Manager.

END OF ENTITLEMENT TO STATUTORY SICK PAY

12.

When a Subpostmaster has exhausted his entitlement to statutory sick pay he will be
sent a form SSP1(T), on which, if he is still sick, he can claim state sickness benefit

from the Department of Social Security.

RULES OF PAYMENT

13.

In accordance with the Act, Post Office Counters Ltd is obliged to abate any
remuneration due by the appropriate amount of statutory sick pay. The effect of this
will mean that for the first eight weeks of sickness, remuneration will be paid in full
and that statutory sick pay will be regarded as “notional”. Consequently although
statutory sick pay will be regarded as “notional” the total remuneration paid the
Subpostmaster will continue to attract income tax and National Insurance

contributions in full.

DUAL EMPLOYMENT

14.

If a Subpostmaster who is sick is also employed either by the Post Office (e.g. as an
Auxiliary Postman) or another employer, and provided National Insurance

contributions are paid separately for each employment and all other conditions are
met, he must claim statutory sick pay in respect of both his Subpostmaster services

and other employment(s).

SICK ABSENCE SUBSTITUTION SCHEME

15.

The provisions of this Scheme, which are set out in Section 5, remain except that no
claim will be entertained unless the Regional General Manager has been properly
notified of the Subpostmaster’s sickness. Claims for reimbursement for up to 28
weeks’ sick absence will not be subject to abatement in respect of Statutory Sick Pay.
Claims for reimbursement for a period of sickness which does not attract statutory

sick pay will continue to be subject to abatement.

SECTION 10

NATIONAL INSURANCE

CLASSIFICATION

1. For National Insurance purposes, a Subpostmaster is regarded as an office holder with
emoluments chargeable to Income Tax under Schedule E. As such, all Subpostmasters
are liable to make National Insurance contributions in accordance with the provisions

of Class 1.
Class 1 contributions comprise 2 parts:-

(a) _ the Primary contribution which is generally known as the employee's

contribution;

(b) _ the Secondary contribution which is generally known as the employer's

contribution.

PERSONS TAKING UP APPOINTMENT AS A SUBPOSTMASTER

2. All persons taking up an appointment as a Subpostmaster should supply the Regional
General Manager with their National Insurance number by means of a NI number
card, form P45 and/or P60 (see leaflet NI217) and also any current certificate of
Earner’s non/reduced rate liability that they have. Where for one reason or another a
new Subpostmaster does not supply a NI number the action outlined in the
Employer's Guide to National Insurance Contributions (NP15) will be followed.

CONTRACTING OUT

3. Under the Social Security Act 1975, pensions for retirement, widowhood and
invalidity consist of 2 parts:-

(a) _ basic pension;

(b) and additional pension related to an employee's reckonable earnings between the
lower earnings limit and the upper earnings limit.

4. Anemployer may contract his employees out of that part of the State Scheme which
provides an additional pension if the Occupational Pensions Board is satisfied that his
occupational pensions scheme meets the conditions required by the Act. As
Subpostmasters are not employees of Post Office Counters Ltd they are ineligible to
belong to the Post Office Staff Superannuation Scheme and therefore are not
contracted out of the State Scheme.

CONTRIBUTIONS

5. DSS leaflet NP15 “Eniployer’s Guide to National Insurance Contributions” gives a
guide to the contribution arrangements.

6. Provided that earnings reach or exceed the lower earnings limit, a Subposunaster will

be liable to pay primary contributions on all earnings up to the upper earnings limit

ake

(a) the standard rate; or

(b) the reduced rate (see paragraph 8); or

(©) _ is not liable for contributions because he/she is over pension age or has made

other arrangements (see paragraph 9).

MARRIED WOMEN AND WIDOWS

7. There is no longer a right to choose to pay reduced rate contributions. However, a
woman entitled to pay at the reduced rate for the 1977-78 tax year continues to be able

to do so for subsequent years unless:-

(a) she revokes her election;

(b) as a married woman her marriage ends in divorce or annulment;

(c) _ she becomes a widow and after the initial period becomes entitled to widow's

benefit;

(d) during 2 consecutive tax years which fall after 5 April 1978 she was neither

liable to pay a Class 1 contribution nor was self-employed.

DSS will provide a certificate authorising deductions of a Class 1 contributor's
contribution at the reduced rate. As Post Office Counters Ltd will be held responsible
for any deficiencies in contribution, deductions will be made at the standard rate

unless the Subpostmistress produces a valid certificate.

NON LIABLE SUBPOSTMASTERS.

8 No contributions are payable by men over 65 or women over 60 and in such
circumstances DSS will normally issue a certificate of age contribution. However, if
some other definite evidence is being held to show that a Subpostmaster has reached
age 65 (60 for a woman) his/her deductions may be ceased even though a certificate of

age exception has not been produced.

9. The Secondary contribution (see paragraph 2) is due at the same rate regardless of the

Subpostmaster’s rate of contribution or even where he is non liable.

ARREARS OF REMUNERATION

10. Arrears of remuneration resulting from a revision or other payments made to adjust
remuneration paid in an earlier month, will be treated as part of the total
remuneration in the month in which the payment is made, regardless of the period for
which they are proper to. This applies whether or not the additional payments are

made regularly,

11. Where arrears of remuneration are due to a former Subpostmaster national insurance

contributions will be calculated from the weekly contributions table published by DSS.

12. Contributions are not payable on any remuneration that might be due to a

Subpostmaster’s estate after his death.

HOLIDAY AND SICK ABSENCE PAYMENTS

13. Contributions are not due on any payments made under the holiday substitution or
Sick Absence Substitution schemes because all payments are made in respect of

specific costs incurred.

SICKNESS BENEFITS

14. NI Contributions continue to be payable when a Subpostmaster who is sick continues
to receive his scale payment. NI sickness /industrial injury benefits received are not

assessable for NI contribution.

SUBPOSTMASTERS WITH MORE THAN ONE EMPLOYMENT

15. Primary Class 1 contributions are normally payable in respect of each job including
other Sub-Office appointments for which earnings exceed the lower earnings limit,
unless a current form RD950 has been received from DSS. Even where a form RD950

is held, POCL is obliged to collect Secondary Class contributions.

decides to be necessary and for which it is prepared to pay.

RESITING OF POST OFFICE SECURITY EQUIPMENT

(b) Subpostmaster has no alternative but to move his NIL
premises or alter them to meet requirements beyond

his control.

(c) Subpostmaster wishes to re-arrange his private 50%
accommodation, which will neither increase nor
improve the Post Office accommodation, but will

require security equipment to be moved.

(a) Subpostmaster wishes to re-arrange his private 80%
accommodation, which will reduce Post Office
accommodation, though not to a level unacceptable
to the Regional General Manager, but security

equipment will need to be moved.

The above scale is intended as a rough guide only and Regional General Managers
have discretion to fix the level of contribution according to the circumstances of each

particular case.

RESIDENCE

8. A Subpostmaster who does not reside on the premuises must satisfy his Regional
General Manger that he has made proper provision for the safety of Post Office
Counters cash and stock entrusted to his care. If residential accommodation is
associated with the sub-office the Subpostmaster must inform the Regional General
Manager if he does not occupy it himself, or if he ceases to do so, and must

immediately inform the Regional General Manager if at any time it becomes vacant.

MAILWORK OFFICES

10.

At Mailwork sub-offices where Post Office employees work on the premises, the

Subpostmaster will in addition be required to provide at his own expense:-

Access to lavatory facilities;

Facilities for washing, including a supply of hot water, e.g. a kettle of hot water where

running hot water is not available;

Hat and coat pegs;

Facilities for making tea, if required;

Adequate lighting and ventilation;

Adequate heating in winter.

‘The Subpostmaster as occupier of the premises, is required to provide most of the
above facilities under the provisions of the Offices, Shops and Railways Act 1963. It is
likely that the presence of postmen on the premises will require the Subpostmaster, as
occupier, to comply with other provisions of this Act. In addition duties are laid
down in Sections 3 and 4 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, as regards
persons not in his employment. Bearing in mind that the responsibility is his, it is in
the Subpostmaster’s best interest to be aware of the various requirements of these

Acts.

EXTENDED HOURS

Where a Subpostmaster wishes to conduct Post Office business outside standard
hours, Regional General Managers will consider such requests taking into account the

appropriate for a particular office but the Subpostmaster disagrees, the Subpostmaster
may if he wishes trial a rearrangement of the opening hours. A trial period should not
extend beyond three months.

AND NEW YEAR PERIOD AND (WHERE APPLICABLE) ON THE THURSDAY

SECTION 15

GENERAL

A Subpostmaster must provide, at his own expense, any assistance which he may

need to carry out the work in his sub-office.

Assistants are employees of the Subpostmaster. A Subpostmaster will be held wholly
responsible for any failure, on the part of his Assistants, to apply Post Office rules, or
to provide a proper standard of service to the public. He will also be required to
make good any deficiency, of cash or stock, which may result fron: his assistants’

actions.

ASSISTANTS’ CONDITIONS OF SERVICE

AGE

Wages, hours, holidays ete., are a nuatter to be settled between Subpostmaster and the
assistants concerned. However, they should be no less favourable than those enjoyed
by shop assistants generally in the same district. Post Office Counters Ltd reserves

the right to intervene if such conditions are considered inequitable.

The Subpostmaster is responsible, as employer of his assistants, for complying with

the provisions of any legislation which imposes obligations on employers.

SUITABILITY OF APPLICANTS - REFERENCES

6. _ Inthe light of the Subpostmaster’s responsibilities, set out in paragraph 2 above, he is
strongly recommended to satisfy himself of the character and suitability of an
applicant for employment as an Assistant before a firm offer of employment is made.

Generally the Subpostmaster should:-

(@) obtain proof of the identity of the applicant, e.g, birth or marriage certificate,

unless the applicant is known;

(b) _ seek information form the applicant about any conviction or finding of guilt for
any offence in a Court of Law (including Juvenile Court or Court Martial). In
this connection the Subpostmaster should be aware of the Rehabilitation of

Offenders Act 1974 which restricts the information that needs be given;

(c) enquire whether the applicant has ever been employed by the Post Office,
worked for another Subpostmaster or held sub-office appointment. If the
former then details of such employment should be entered on form P250 (see
paragraph 8) and a reference waited from the Regional General Manager. If
previously the applicant has worked at another Sub-Post Office, including as a
Subpostmaster, details should be given on form P250 and a reference in respect

of that employment sought from the Subpostmaster concerned;

(a) _ obtain references from all previous employers or schools attended over the last
3 years or from the last employer where the applicant has been employed

during the whole of that period.

7. When seeking references the Subpostmaster is advised to enquire if the applicant had
found to be completely trustworthy and ask the reason for his leaving that
employment. In some instances a Subpostmaster might have to employ an Assistant
before the procedures suggested above are completed. Bearing in mind the
complexities of current employment legislation a Subpostmaster in such a situation is
recommended to offer initially only short term employment pending receipt of
satisfactory references etc.

8. The Subpostmaster must notify the Regional General Manager of his intention to
employ a new Assistant on Post Office Counters Ltd work or when an Assistant

ceases to be employed in the sub-office.

PERSONAL DECLARATION

9.

Before any person (including a member of the Subpostmaster’s family) is allowed to
have access to mails or to perform, either temporarily or permanently, any Post Office
work, he/she must make a personal declaration on form P13 (see section 16, appendix
2).

The declaration of the Subpostmaster’s Assistants and of any members of his family
who perform Post Office duties should be signed in the Subpostmaster’s presence in
circumstances which will help to fix the occasion and the declaration in the memory of
the signatory. The declaration should be made with proper deliberation and the
Subpostmaster should stress its importance and witness the signature. A signed and
witnessed copy of the form should be given to the signatory at the time and he should

be advised to preserve it carefully.

Forms P13 can be obtained from the Regional General Manager as required and must

be returned to him when signed.

SUB-OFFICE ASSISTANT ACCUSED OR SUSPECTED OF DISHONESTY ETC.

10.

VW

In cases where an Assistant is accused or suspected of dishonesty or any other offence
such as wilfully delaying postal packets, the Subpostmaster must report the
particulars to the Regional General Manager as soon as possible and await
instructions. If the report is made by telephone it must be confirmed in writing as a

matter of urgency.

In cases where a person employed by the Subpostmaster is guilty of misappropriating
Post Office Counters Ltd money, any sum which may be tendered by, or on behalf of,
the offender may be accepted but a receipt must be given showing that the money is
held pending possible investigation and without prejudice to any action that Post
Office Counters Ltd may be advised to take. The Subpostmaster should be careful not
to take any action which may be liable to prejudice the question of legal proceedings.

A copy of any receipt must be kept for reference.

UNSUITABLE PERSONS

12.

13.

(a)

(b)

In order to help prevent the employment of unsuitable or dishonest persons on Post
Office work, a Subpostmaster must notify the Regional General Manager if he
dismisses an employee on these grounds, or if his enquiries about an applicant for
employment give him reason to believe that the applicant is an unsuitable person.
Brief particulars of the evidence should be forwarded to the Regional General
Manager who will decide what steps should be taken to prevent the applicant

obtaining employment elsewhere in the Post Office or at another sub-office.

Where Post Office Counters Ltd has good reason to believe that it would not be in its
best interests for a particular person to have access to Post Office Counters Ltd cash
and stock as a Sub-Office Assistant it may call upon the Subpostmaster to:

refrain from offering that person a post if not already employed;

ensure that the person is not further employed on Post Office business if employed.

OUTDOOR POSTAL WORK

14.

For any outdoor postal work required, provision is made either by the employment of
staff in the direct employ of the Post Office or by a special allowance to the

Subpostmaster for the engagement of casual labour.

SECTION 16

DIVULGENCE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION, CORRESPONDENCE & INTERVIEWS

DIVULGENCE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION

1. The unauthorised disclosure, or use directly, of any information or document which
has come to the knowledge of a Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant through the
work of his Sub-Office is forbidden. Any such disclosure may render the offender
liable to prosecution under Post Office legislation or the Official Secrets Act (see
paragraph 3)

2.  Subpostmasters and their employees must not disclose any information regarding
postal packets passing through the post except to the person(s) to whom such packets
are addressed; nor may they make known information that may come to them

or the private affairs of any person.

PERSONAL DECLARATIONS

3. (a) All Subpostmasters on taking up appointment and newly recruited Sub-Office
Assistants are required to sign a Personal Declaration (form P13) which reminds
them of the duty of the Post Office to ensure that all communications and items
entrusted to it reach the people for whom they are intended promptly and
sately, and that the information in them reaches no one not entitled to it. The

Subpostmasters form P301) or attempting to revoke or disclaim his signature on

the form(s).

4. Any request made by the Police or any other authority or by a private person for
information which may be confidential, or may concern matters connected with the
duties of another Subpostmaster or a Post Office employee, or with regard to the

ensuring fair and accurate presentation of facts about the Post Office and its services;
comment by other persons is undesirable and in particular, untrue, ill-informed or
reckless comment will not be allowed to go unchallenged. While recognising the right
of any individual to comment publicly on matters of general interest therefore, the
Post Office expects Subpostmasters and their employees who wish to comment upon
matters affecting the Post Office to exercise those right in a responsible manner.
Subpostmasters must ensure, when communicating with the press or offering
comment which may be broadcast on radio or television, that their conuments do not
go beyond the accepted bounds of propriety and are not likely to cause
embarrassment or to miislead the public. The Regional General Manager should be

asked to advise in cases of doubt.

Federation spokesman and give his own name.

8. Particular care is necessary when offering spontaneous comment to press or

broadcasting reporters or interviewers.

important are stated overleaf. It is important for you to know
and understand those provisions, not only for your own sake,
but also in order that you should not, through any fault or
omission on your part, enable or tempt others to break them.

It is legal to disclose official information without authority. A
person engaged in Post Office work must not disclose any
information which he/she obtains as a result of that work, unless
he/she has written permission to do so.

You shall neither during you employment with the Post Office
nor for a period of 1 year after that employment ceases, disclose
to any other person, firm, or company, or publish or broadcast or
use for your own benefit any confidential information relating in
any way to the activities, operations or business methods of the
Post Office, except as previously authorised in writing by the

Protection Act, 1984, if he/she improperly obtains, holds or
discloses any such information, of if he/she improperly transfers
it outside the United Kingdom.

SUBPOSTMASTERS’ PRIVATE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES; BETTING AND GAMBLING;
POLITICAL ACTIVITIES

“PRIVATE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES”

1. The appointment of a Subpostmaster confers on the individual concerned the right to
transact, and to receive payment for, certain items of business of behalf of Post Office
Counters Ltd at the premises specified. The conditions of the appointment also
involve such restrictions on the private activities of the Subpostmaster as are
necessary to ensure the continued viability of Post Office Counters nation-wide

network.

2. Ibis, therefore, in the interests of all Subpostmasters that Post Office Counters Ltd
should be able to seek, negotiate and manage retail business in the market place
without the risk that it will find any Subpostmaster competing against it for the same
business, and accordingly a Subpostmaster must not undertake in a private capacity
any business, or allow anyone else to undertake on the premises in which a sub-office

BETTING AND GAMBLING

6. A Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant should not:

(a) _ bet or gamble by means of post (betting by private telephone off the Post Office
part of the premises is permissible);

(b) take part in racing etc. pool or competitions or betting at “fixed odds” on

such local lotteries as are permitted under the Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976
(Northern Ireland in part III of the Betting and Lotteries Act (Northern Ireland) 1957).
The onus of ensuring that the law is complied with rests with the person concerned in
the promotion and conducting of the lottery and the sale of tickets. Tickets for such
lotteries must not be sold over the sub-office counter nor must the Post Office be used
in any way for advertising purposes, e.g. in giving addresses at which tickets are
available, nor must advertisements include the words Post Office, Sub-Post Office or
Subpostmaster.

9. Asub-office may not be situated in premises for which an “on” licence allowing for
the sale of drinks, other than a restaurant, has been granted, unless the premises have

licensed premises. There is no objection to the Subpostmaster holding and “off”

licence provided the liquor is sold in closed vessels.

Manger will inform him of arrangements whereby he may name a deputy to act as
Subpostmaster should he be elected. If he is elected he will be able to resume office
when he ceases to be a Member of Parliament, provided he has complied with the
arrangements for naming a deputy and the sub-office has not been closed through
normal changes during his absence; should he fail to comply with these arrangements
he will be regarded as having resigned on the day he is elected. If he is not elected he

SECTION 18

NON-OBSERVANCE OF RULES: APPEALS PROCEDURE

ALLEGATIONS OF NON-COMPLIANCE OR NON-OBSERVANCE OF RULES

1. Although there may be instances where civil or criminal proceedings are
contemplated in which it would serve no useful purpose to call for a written
explanation, in all other instances, and without prejudice to any subsequent
proceedings, any Subpostmaster will be afforded an opportunity of giving a written
explanation of allegations of non-compliance or non-observance of the rules which are

made against him.

2. At the discretion of the Retail Network Manager which will not normally be withheld,
the Subpostmaster may, if he wishes, meet the Retail Network Manager to discuss the
allegations. he may be accompanied by a friend while doing so. The friend must be
aged 18 or over and cannot be someone involved in the enquiry. The friend must be a
Subpostmaster, sub-office Assistant or Post Office employee - and can be the local
NESP representative.

3. As repeated breaches of the rules, even if minor in themselves, may lead to the
determination, without further warning or appeal, of the contract by means of the
giving of three months notice, it is strongly recommended that Subpostmasters take
the opportunity to make such written and verbal explanations of their actions at the
time of the alleged breach of rules. A record will be kept by the Retail Network
Manager of any such discussions and of any written warnings issued to the

Subpostmaster.

REPRESENTATIONS ON POST OFFICE MATTERS

4. — Without prejudice to the above a Subpostmaster may address at any time the Regional
General Manager and representation he may wish to make having reference to his
duties, remuneration or any other Post Office matter. The decision of the Regional

General Manager as to his response to such representations is final.

81 Issue
September 1994

POL00082751
POL00082751

APPEALS

5. If the Subpostmaster wishes to appeal against a decision to summarily terminate his
contract for services, he may do so either in writing or by personal interview and will
be allowed ten (10) working days from the date of the termination letter to make
application, to a member of the Post Office Counters Ltd “Appeals Authority” whose
decision will be final. There is no formal appeal against three months notice of
contract termination or against termination with pay in lieu of notice. Appeals on all
other issues (e.g. recovery of losses caused by the Subpostmasters negligence) are

heard by the Regional General Manager whose decision is final.

APPROACHES TO PERSONS OUTSIDE THE POST OFFICE

6. Until the Subpostmaster has exercised his final right of appeal, he should not ask
persons outside the Post Office to take up the case on his behalf although this does not
prevent a Subpostmaster from obtaining such advice and support from the NFSP or
any other outside person as may help him to present his case effectively. The
Subpostmaster should not detain Post Office papers or allow them out of his custody
for the purpose of such consultation without the permission of the Retail Network

Manager.

SECTION 19

OFFENCES: SUSPENSION: ENQUIRIES BY OFFICERS OF THE INVESTIGATION
DIVISION

1. Dishonesty is viewed most seriously and any Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant
believed to have carried, or taken part in, an act of dishonesty against Post Office
Counters Ltd may be prosecuted. Furthermore, any Subpostmaster so involved
renders himself liable to summary termination of his contract. The case of an
Assistant Post Office Counters Ltd may recommend to the Subpostmaster that the

Assistant should no longer remain in his employ on Post Office Counters business.

ARRESTS AND CONVICTIONS

2. A Subpostmaster must report to his Regional General Manager if he is arrested and
refused bail, or if he is convicted by a Court of any criminal offence (except a traffic
offence for which the penalty has not included imprisonment).

IMMORALITY AND OTHER MATTERS OF PERSONAL CONDUCT

3. It is the aim and practice of Post Office Counters Ltd to maintain, to the maximum
extent compatible with needs of service to the public, an attitude of non-interference
in the private lives of Subpostmasters. However, where facts come to light calculated
to cause public scandal or grave embarrassment to the Post Office in connection with
a Subpostmaster’s private conduct, the question of his fitness for retention in office

may have to be considered.

SUSPENSION FROM OFFICE

4. A Subpostmaster may be suspended from office at any time if that course is
considered desirable in the interest of Post Office Counters Ltd in consequence of his:
{a) being arrested, (b) having civil or criminal proceedings brought or made against
him, (c) where irregularities or misconduct at the office(s) where he holds
appointment(s) have been established to the satisfaction of Post Office Counters Ltd,

or are admitted, or are suspected and are being investigated.

5. Where a Subpostmaster is suspended his remuneration in respect of any period of

suspension will be withheld so long as such suspension continues.

6. On the termination of the period of suspension whether by termination of contract or
reinstatement, the Subpostmaster’s remuneration in respect of the period may, after
consideration of the whole of the circumstances of the case, be forfeited wholly or in
part. If remuneration is paid any rent or other expenses which may have been paid to
him in respect of the continued use of his premises for Post Office purposes during the

period of suspension will be deducted. .

CRIMINAL CONDUCT: REPORTING

7. If a Subpostmaster has knowledge or suspicion of dishonesty or other criminal
conduct affecting the Post Office on the part of any person including a Sub-Office
Assistant or a Post Office employee he must, if there is any apparent need for
immediate action, at once tell the Regional General Manager confidentially of his

knowledge or suspicion.

INDUCEMENT TO ACT CONTRARY TO RULES

8. If any person should try to induce a Subpostmaster or a member of his staff to act
contrary to the rules (if, for example, he should be asked to datestamp covers
irregularly with a view to either himself or the offender afterwards enclosing therein
betting slips or other communications relating to the result of some race, game or
sport) he should, while avoiding compliance (save in the case described in paragraph
9, also avoid putting that person upon his guard by definite refusal). The
Subpostmaster should as soon as possible tell the Regional General Manager what has
happened giving a full report and description of the person so that an immediate

report can be made to POID and instructions sought.

9. A Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant who is asked irregularly to put in course of
post for despatch or delivery from his own office a cover already date-stamped,
addressed to a betting agent, and presumably already containing a betting slip or
other communication respecting the result of some race, game or sport, should accept
it and with it any bribe offered for compliance. He should at once initial the cover and
hand it and the bribe to the Regional General Manager, to whom he should report as
provided in the last sentence of paragraph 8.

THEFTS BY STRANGERS

10. A Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant who sees a theft of Post Office Property
committed by a stranger should inform the Police of the facts and then report the

matter to his Regional General Manager as soon as possible,

FAILURE TO REPORT DISHONESTY

11. In line with any employee of the Post Office a Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant
is expected to report immediately any suspicion of dishonesty or criminal intent
which may in any way affect the Post Office, whether the likely offender be connected
with the Post Office or not. He is similarly enjoined to render all possible assistance to

officers of the Investigation Division (see below).

ENQUIRIES BY OFFICERS OF THE POST OFFICE INVESTIGATION DIVISION

12. The main job of the Investigation Division is to investigate, or help the Police to
investigate, criminal offences against the Post Office, British Telecommunications and
the Department of National Savings. the Investigation Division does NOT enquire

into matters where crime is not suspected.

13. Most of the crimes dealt with by the Investigation Division are committed by
outsiders. If follows that a common reason for Investigation Division officers seeking
interviews with persons employed on Post Office business is to get help in clearing up
such offences. Usually the help takes the form of a witness statement that provides
evidence about a particular act or acts that the witness has carried out in the course of
his or her duty.

POL00082751
POL00082751

Although they comprise the minority of all Investigation Division crime
investigations, there are many cases where the possibility (or even direct suspicion)
arises that persons employed on Post Office business may be involved. Officers of the
Investigation Division conduct interviews about these suspected offences and they are
required to observe the same code of conduct when obtaining evidence as that laid
down for Police Officers. This provides for an officer investigating a criminal offence
to question any person, whether suspected or not, from whom he thinks that useful
information may be obtained. As soon as the Investigation Division officer has
evidence which would afford reasonable ground for suspecting that a person has
comunitted an offence, he must caution him before asking any questions about that
offence. The caution must be in terms which make it clear that the suspected person is
not obliged to say anything unless he wishes to do so and that what he says will be

put into writing and given in evidence.

If a Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant is questioned as a suspected person by an
officer of the Investigation Division, on statements made by a third person, and
expresses a desire to be confronted by that person, such confrontation will, if
practicable, be arranged. At the confrontation, the suspect will be at liberty to
question the third person on his evidence and the questions and replies will be

recorded by the Investigation Division officer.

FRIENDS AT INVESTIGATION INTERVIEWS

16.

At all interviews between Investigation Division Officers and a Subpostmaster or Sub-
Office Assistant, the interviewing officer will first introduce himself, explain the
nature of the enquiry, the ask the person to be interviewed if he wishes to have a
friend present. The introduction and explanation are necessary first steps so the
person to be interviewed knows what is involved when he makes his free personal

choice whether to ask for a friend to be present at the interview or not.

86 Issue
September 1994

©Copyright reserved
17.

18.

19.

A friend invited to attend an Investigation Division interview must be aged 18 or over
and cannot be someone involved in the inquiry. The friend must be a Subpostmaster,
Sub-Office Assistant or Post Office employee - and can be the local NFSP
representative. To avoid unreasonable delay and to ensure that interviews will not
commence until a friend, if requested, is present, the person being interviewed will be
asked to nominate alternative friends if the one first (or subsequently) chosen is not
available or may be involved in the enquiry.

If a person being interviewed declines to have a friend present when asked but
changes his mind later, he may ask for a friend to be called at that stage. If he is not
questioned as a suspected person at the outset (i.e. not under caution), but fresh
evidence emerges during the interview which gives reasonable grounds for suspicion,
the Investigation Division officer will make this clear and explain that he proposes to
continue his questions after caution. Before the caution is given the Investigation
Division officer will ask if the presence of a friend is desired during the remainder of

the interview.

A friend may only attend and listen to questions and answers. He must not interrupt
in any way, either by word or signal; if he does interrupt he will be required to leave
at once and the interview will proceed without him. Whatever is said at the interview
is to be treated as in strictest confidence. The friend may take notes of the interview
but he must keep the notes in the strictest confidence. The only communication the
friend is entitled to make on behalf of the person who has been questioned will be in
the form of a written “in strictest confidence” statement which may be submitted by
the latter, in support of any official appeal which the person questioned may desire to
make in connection with the methods followed at the enquiry. No other
communication about the interview is allowed (unless made by permission of the Post
Office) as it might constitute a breach of the Official Secrets Acts. The questioned
officer may, however, if he so desires, communicate the friend's statement to the

National Federation of Sub-Postmasters in strictest confidence.

SEARCHES

20.

21.

If a person agrees to his property or house being searched by Investigation Division.
staff the Investigation Division officer will ask, before the search is carried out, if he
wishes to have a friend present.

Investigation Division officers have no authority to search a Subpostmaster or Sub-
Office Assistant or their homes unless the have first obtained the agreement of the
person concerned or they have obtained. a warrant to do so. In practice Investigation
Division officers only seek authority or permission to search when it is deemed.
absolutely necessary or in the interests of the person involved (e.g. as a pointer to their
innocence). If search by consent is carried out during the course of enquiries which
do not substantiate any suspicion that may have been directed at a Subpostmaster or
Sub-Office Assistant, he will be handed at a later stage a written apology for any
inconvenience caused, coupled with a statement that he readily agreed to the search
and that nothing which would cast any doubt on his honesty was found.

SECTION 20

INFECTIOUS (INCLUDING CONTAGIOUS) DISEASES

Subpostmasters, are expected to act on the advice given by their general practitioners
or hospital specialists, and to refrain from providing “Personal Service”, by taking
leave of absence, through sickness if advised to do so. This is both for their own good
and that of others.

Contact with a person suffering from such a disease will only rarely exempt a
Subpostmaster from providing Post Office services, nevertheless the advice in Par. 1

may apply if the medical practitioner so advises.

“Open cases” of Pulmonary tuberculosis must receive clearance from the Post Office,

before a Subpostmaster will be allowed to resume the provision of “Personal Service”.

If the local Public Health Department should require the temporary closing of the
office, the Regional General Manager will issue instructions as to the stock, etc. In
such cases the question of continuing payment of the subpostmaster’s emoluments
subject to a deduction in respect of any saving in expenses, will be considered on its

merits.

These conditions apply equally to any assistants employed by a subpostmaster on
Post Office duties. Also, in such cases the question of meeting any loss sustained by
the Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant in consequence of the latters enforced
absence will be considered on its merits. It should, however, be understood that the
object of any payment that may be made by Post Office Counters Ltd in these cases is
to prevent there being any inducement to the sub-office Assistant to come on duty
when his presence would be a source of danger to the public or the Post Office
employees with whom they might come in contact in his Post Office work. Post Office

Counter recognises no other obligation in the matter.

TELEPHONE FACILITIES AT SCALE PAYMENT SUB-POST OFFICES

PROVISION OF TELEPHONE FACILITIES

1. A Subpostmaster must, in connection with official business of Post Office Counter
Ltd, and in the interests of security, arrange for the provision of telephone facilities at

his sub-post office. The following facilities are required by Post Office Counters Ltd:-

(a) a direct exchange line; or

(b) _anextension plan installation comprising a portable telephone and two sockets:
one to be installed in the sub-post office and the other in the Subpostmaster’s
bedroom. (This type of installation is only required where the Regional General
Manager considers it is desirable, as a security measure, and where the
Subpostmaster resides on the premises. However, Post Office Counters Ltd will
not require this type of system to be installed at island and small rural offices
where the Regional General Manager considers that the risk of criminal attack is

clearly negligible).

REIMBURSEMENT OF INSTALLATIONS COSTS

2. Post Office Counters Ltd will reimburse the Subpostmaster for costs incurred in the
installation of the required telephone facility provided that excessive expenditure is
not involved. However in the event that the Subpostmaster decides to have installed
a system other than that required by Post Office Counters Ltd the Post Office
contribution to the total installation costs will be no greater than the cost of installing
the facilities outlined in paragraph 1 above. If a Subpostmaster is required to make
provision for an extension plan system as described in paragraph 1(b) and chooses to
have an extension socket in a room other than his bedroom the Post Office
contribution to the installation cost will be no greater than would be incurred in

respect of the installation of a direct exchange line.

RENTAL CHARGES:

3. Post Office Counters Ltd on production of a paid quarterly telephone account, will
reimburse the Subpostmaster the rental charges billed by BT including the VAT
element (see paragraph 10) appropriate to the type of telephone facility that the
Regional General Manager has agreed is necessary (see paragraph 1). Rental charges
which exceed the levels so authorised by the District Manger remain the responsibility
of the Subpostmaster.

CALL UNIT ALLOWANCE

4. Each Subpostmaster is given for each telephone account period an allowance of call
units for official purposes, based on the scale of Post Office business transacted; any
part of the allowance not expended in a telephone account period cannot be carried
over to the next. The Subpostmaster is due to pay for all call units used in excess of

this allowance.

5. The standard allowances have been fixed at a level which takes into account the

varying conditions between offices. ‘They also allow a margin for contingencies.

6. The scale of allowances, related to the telephone account period, is as follows; the call
unit allowance in column (b) is intended to reimburse Subpostmasters for longer
distance calls to DNS, Girobank etc., where these are not covered by the basic

allowance in column (a):

made in connection with his Mailwork responsibilities, providing that the standard
allowance has been expended. A claim, supported by documentary evidence should
be submitted to the Regional General Manager with the telephone account for the

period concerned.

EMERGENCY REPAIRS

9. — Some British Telecom General Managers are prepared to provide emergency repair

facilities for Subpostmasters. The service allows for attention to faults reported:-
(a) Monday-Friday between 1700 and 0800 hours;

(b) Saturday up to 0800 and from 1300 hours;

(©) all day on Sunday, Public and Bank Holidays.

SECTION 22

QUALITY STANDARDS

1. Post Office Counters Ltd, through its network of post offices, aims to give customers
and clients a high quality service. The Subpostmaster must therefore give high
priority to serving customers quickly and efficiently, and to fulfilling the
documentation requirements of clients with accuracy and professionalism. Also the
Subpostmaster will participate in “Putting the Customer First” by attending the
training sessions which form the programme and carrying out the interim activity

required between sessions.

The interim activity consist of commitment to display the Customer Charter in the
public area of the sub post office, and to hand out questionnaires inviting customer
feedback. On an ongoing basis questionnaires will be handed out at regular intervals,
to be determined by POCL, but not more than once every six months. In addition to
the issue of questionnaires Subpostmasters, particularly those in larger offices, will be
encouraged to measure customer service as described below. Subpostmaster’s sub-
office assistants are also expected to undergo the “Putting the Customer First”
programme, either at sessions led by the Subpostmasters themselves, once they are
trained, or the retail network manager. Subpostmasters should make all reasonable

efforts to encourage their staff to participate in the training.

Payment for attendance at the four “off site” sessions, led by retail network managers,
within the “Putting the Customer First” programme, will be for travel and

substitution.

WAITING TIME

2. The Subpostmaster should ensure that the time for which customers wait to be served
is kept to the minimum, and make any adjustments to the staffing pattern accordingly.
To help achieve this objective Subpostmasters in offices displaying the charter,
particularly those in larger offices, will be encouraged to monitor waiting times using

the system developed by POCL.

o4 Issue
September 1994

‘©Copyright reserved
POL00082751
POL00082751

This entails counting the number of customers queuing and the number of derks
serving, three times a day and to supply the information to POCL to enable the

results to be analysed and fed back to the Subpostmaster.

While POCL has an overall national objective for customers to wait for no longer than
five minutes before being served, it is recognised that customers have different needs
and expectations of waiting time in different offices, and at different times of the day
or week. However, Regional General Managers will treat very seriously any evidence
which suggests that the Subpostmaster is not making all reasonable efforts to ensure

that customer waiting time is minimised, to meet the needs of customers locally.

TRANSACTIONS

3. The Subpostmaster will be responsible for ensuring that transactions are carried out
accurately, that all reasonable steps are taken to prevent fraud and that all
documentation is properly completed and despatched at the due time. Where under
the terms of its contracts with its clients Post Office Counters Ltd incurs financial
penalties as a result of the Subpostmaster’s failure in this regard, Post Office Counters
Ltd may pass on this additional cost to the Subpostmaster. The Appendix to this
Section sets out the current maxima of the penalties which can be passed on to the
Subpostmaster. In such circumstances, Post Office Counters Ltd will furnish copies of
the appropriate documents as evidence in support of any action. Failure to properly
complete accounting and traffic information documents may lead to the exclusion in

whole or in part of business transacted for the purposes of determining payment.

4. The Subpostmaster will ensure that customers are treated fairly, courteously and
helpfully. Persistent failure to meet the high standard of service demanded by Post

Office Counters Ltd could result in termination of contract.

SECTION 23

REDEMPTION OF TELEPHONE, TELEVISION, MOTOR VEHICLE AND OTHER

SAVINGS STAMPS

A Subpostmaster must only accept savings stamps either in total or part payment for

the relevant transaction to which they refer.

It is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE for a Subpostmaster (or anybody acting on his
behalf) to:-

(i) exchange redeemed savings stamps for cash;

(i) affix savings stamps to savings cards and claim them as if they had been

redeemed by a customer in the normal course;

(ii) convert total of partial cash or cheque payments for licence or accounts
payments into stamps and claim them as if they had been presented by a

customer;

(iv) convert official cash (whether directly from the till or paid in over the counter)
into savings stamps (whether affixed to a card or not) for use as a means of
saving for any purpose whatsoever; or to take action which improperly sets out

to increase his remuneration.

Redeemed savings stamps must be despatched immediately following completion of
the cash account on which the transaction to which they refer takes place. It is not
acceptable to remit redeemed savings stamps later than the scheduled despatch date

or to remit several weeks redemption together.

In the event that cases of falsification come to light Post Office Counters Ltd will view
such activities extremely seriously and in such circumstances almost certainly

consider termination of the Subpostmasters Contract for services.

Mailwork Sub Post Otfices. The following schedule outlines these standards by reference to
workplace regulation issued by Health and Safety Executive under section 16 of the Health and

Safety at Work Act 1974.

The determination of whether these standards are achieved at particular offices will be made, if
appropriate via Royal Mail (RM) carrying out risk assessments on accommodation used for
Mailwork. RM will communicate the results of risk assessments via Post Office Counters Ltd (POCL)
to the subpostmaster. Any action required as a consequence of the risk assessment will be agreed
between RM, POCL and the subpostmaster and all parties will use reasonable endeavours to ensure
that any such agreement is not unreasonably withheld.

In general terms any action required in respect of general maintenance or what can reasonably be
expected under the following paragraph A will be funded by the sub postmaster. Any action that can
reasonably be attributed to a past change in RM,s requirements or past changes in legislation will be

funded by RM.
Paragraph A

‘The subpostmaster agrees to provide and maintain such accommodation as is required for the
effective discharge of Mailwork duties. In fulfilling this requirement, the subpostmaster will be
responsible for meeting the provisions of all relevant legislation (in particular HASAW) and where
Post Office staff work on the premises specifically provide access to a toilet, facilities for washing,
including a supply of hot water, facilities for making tea, adequate lighting, adequate heating and

ventilation, hat and coat pegs.

The following specification represents guidelines. Their applicability in differing circumstances will

APPENDIX 2
SUB-POSTMASTER SPECIFICATION

The following specification sets out the key outputs that Sub-postmasters must deliver in respect of

the undertaking of mailwork in sub post offices. It should be read in conjunction with the Royal Mail

Specification.

The phraseology uses the term “output”. This represents the achievement of an outcome for which
the Sub-postmaster is responsible. It does not necessarily mean that the Sub-postmaster has to
personally perform the task to deliver the output. For example, “RM employees briefed in
accordance with employee communication programme: does not necessarily mean that the Sub-
postmaster has to lead formal team briefing sessions. [t will mean that the Sub-postmaster will be
responsible for distributing written briefing, facilitating team briefings lead by the RM line manager,

passing on urgent messages for, the line manager to RM employees.

There are a number of outputs, particularly in the Customer and Supervision areas, which cannot be
tightly defined and where an element of discretion is needed in determining the level of Sub-
postmasters involvement. In these cases a test of reasonableness applies. In general terms, Sub-
postmasters are expected to deal with issues that can easily be resolved on the spot. But there is no
requirement for them to leave the mailwork premises to do so. In all cases where Sub-postmasters are
unable to resolve issues or believe that resolution requires additional capability, such difficulties must

be referred to the RM Line Manager.

The detailed local arrangements as to how each output will be achieved at each office will be set out

in the Local Specification which will be agreed between Royal Mail, POCL and the Subpostmaster.

1 SUPERVISION

-RM employees adequately supervised at all times when on mailwork premises.
(NOTE: RM employees will be deemed to be adequately supervised if all the outputs in this

specification are achieved).

-Contact point provided for RM employees based at the mailwork office at all other times when they

are on duty.

-RM employees attendance checked (ie start and where appropriate finish times) and all unforeseen
absence reported to RM line manager.

APPENDIX 4

PAYMENT ON WITHDRAWAL OF MAILWORK

Where the whole or part of either category of Mailwork carried out at a sub-office is withdrawn by
Royal Mail or Royal Mail Parcelforce, the Subpostmaster will receive a lump sum, an arnount
equivalent to 1.5 times the consequential annual reduction in pay. The reduction in pay should take

effect from the date of the withdrawal of the work.

Where appropriate, the payment should take account of all reguiar payments including the effect of
any reduction in the 3% addition paid for minor items of work which attract no specific payment.

Regular and intermittent allowances should also be included in calculating the amount due.

If the withdrawal of Mailwork happens in stages, the Subpostmaster should receive a lump sum in
respect of the reduction on each occasion. In cases where there is simultaneous loss and gain of
Mailwork the lump sum payment shouid be calculated on any nett loss.

Payments should not be made where the change is due to variations in traffic.

At least three months‘ notice, or payment in lieu of three months’ notice will be paid on withdrawal
of Mailwork, except in those cases where the Subpostmaster’s contract is summarily terminated or

where he resigns to avoid summary termination.

Payment for the loss of Mailwork will not be made where work is withdrawn at:-

1. the request of the Subpostmaster;
2. the time of summary termination or resignation to avoid summary termination;
3. a minimum payment office which is already paid for more work than it carries out.

The annual revision date will be unaffected by withdrawal of Mailwork.
