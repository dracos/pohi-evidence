Hi Belinda — sorry, our emails crossed — you should have the former now,

Unfortunately I’m tied up until 14.30 and would struggle to break out of those commitments. Would
anything after 14.30 be workable?

Hi Gareth
We discussed this.

In addition, you are planning to send us something this evening which we will review overnight.
Lesley could do a conversation at 12 tomorrow. Would that work for you.

Best wishes
Belinda

Hi Belinda ~ could you help with the below? Rod has an out of office until the 11" (so I presume is on
holiday?). It would also be key to know whether our work will (or could) need to take into account any
advice or reports that Linklaters have delivered to you (one of the attachments you sent on Friday
mentioned that they had prepared and presented a report to the Board in March?).

Our reason for this query is that Linklaters are an Audit Client of Deloitte. This isn’t likely to be a problem
in terms of our ability to work for you, but it would require us to internally document this and ensure
any formal notification requirements (to both you and potentially Linklaters) were considered.

Many thanks and regards

Gareth

Hi Rodric ~ just progressing our draft engagement letter for you today, and one of the queries arising in
review has been with whom our appointment is with (ie: the addressee of the engagement letter).
Normally, engagements under legal privilege will see us contracting with both the Lawyer firm
representing our client, as well as the client themselves (ie: a contract between us and two direct
clients).

You've mentioned Linklaters a number of times, and I just wanted to check how you require this
engagement structure being setup? Are we contracting purely to POL (on basis you have your own in
house legal team leading on this) or do you want us to include third party lawyers in our engagement
process too?

Thought it worth checking

Gareth,

As discussed earlier today, Post Office Limited is responding to allegations that the “Horizon” IT system
used to record transactions in Post Office branches is defective and/or that the processes associated
with it are inadequate.

In order to respond to these allegations (which have been, and will in all likelihood continue to be,
advanced in the courts), Post Office wants to demonstrate that the Horizon system is robust, fit for
purpose, and/or operates within an appropriate control framework.

In order to determine whether or not Deloittes can help us in this regard, I attach the following
documents:

1. “Horizon Core Audit Process” which outlines how Horizon has been designed to operate;
“Draft Factfile” which deals with how Post Office uses Horizon in our branch network;

3. “Description of Fujitsu’s System of IT Infrastructure Services supporting Post Office Limited’s.
POLSAP and HNG-X applications”;

A table of the themes which underlie some of the allegations that Horizon is deficient; and
5. “Note on Horizon Report” which outlines of the type of report we may require.

Could you please review these so that we can advance our discussions on a further call (or meeting)
during the course of tomorrow.

Kind regards, Rodric
