Mandy/Richard

Iam sorry for the delay in dealing with matters but I am trying to pick up where Stephen left
off. He has ask that I send you a copy of Cath Oglesby's witness statement for you comments
(see attached), Forgive me if you have already seen this but I just need to get this finalised
with a view to serving on RC (and the other statements) as soon as practically possible.

I also have a statement for Helen Rose to check through and I envisage sending this to
everyone this afternoon or tomorrow for comment.

In terms of the Part 36 offer, are we now in a position to send that to RC?

Finally, and again forgive me if I am repeating anything that Stephen has already dealt with, do
you know Mandy if any progress has been made with David Halbert getting anything out of
Fujitsu? Stephen says in a note to me that he sent to Nick Samuel (now left I understand) a
letter to be passed to Fujitsu, and that is what, I presume, David is following up or will be doing
so.

Regards.
