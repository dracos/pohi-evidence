Dear Phil

Many thanks for the call just now and your email.

I'm attaching below the letter which went to James Harding on Friday. I've not had a response as yet. Do let me
know if you think there are any loops I have missed.

It's worth stressing, as I think comes out in the letter, that we have engaged in detail on this issue with Panorama
and a number of other BBC journalists over the last three years. We've also made various offers to help aid
understanding of the position.

I don't make a habit of complaining about media scrutiny, so you will appreciate that I only do so now as I have
such profound concerns about the programme being planned by Panorama.

Thanks for your time on this, it is much appreciated.

Best wishes
Mark
