Gareth,

As discussed earlier today, Post Office Limited is responding to allegations that the “Horizon” IT system used to record
transactions in Post Office branches is defective and/or that the processes associated with it are inadequate.

In order to respond to these allegations (which have been, and will in all likelinood continue to be, advanced in the
courts), Post Office wants to demonstrate that the Horizon system is robust, fit for purpose, and/or operates within an
appropriate control framework.

In order to determine whether or not Deloittes can help us in this regard, I attach the following documents:

1. “Horizon Core Audit Process” which outlines how Horizon has been designed to operate;

2. “Draft Factfile” which deals with how Post Office uses Horizon in our branch network;

3. “Description of Fujitsu’s System of IT Infrastructure Services supporting Post Office Limited’s POLSAP and
HNG-X applications”;

4. Atable of the themes which underlie some of the allegations that Horizon is deficient; and

5. “Note on Horizon Report” which outlines of the type of report we may require.

Could you please review these so that we can advance our discussions on a further call (or meeting) during the course
of tomorrow.

Kind regards, Rodric

Rodric Williams I Litigation Lawyer
