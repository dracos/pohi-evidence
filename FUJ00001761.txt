1 Purpose

This PPD describes the operation of the Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH), in
accordance with Fujitsu Services Core System Release Plus (CSR+).

This PPD provides a description of all the processes involved in order to enable the
contractual agreement of operations and to be a source from which authors can
develop any further user documentation needed.

2 Scope

This PPD contains high-level information on the Horizon System Helpdesk.

For brevity, the Horizon System Helpdesk is referred to in this document as ‘the
HSH’.

This PPD is one of a set of PPDs provided for CSR+. The way in which the set fits
together is described in the CSR+ Introduction PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/093].

The procedure for the post office staff calling the HSH is described in the CSR+
Operating Environment PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/097].

(A Technical Service Desk (TSD) that handles Universal Banking technical incidents is
co-located within the HSH, but the service provided by the TSD does not form part of
the existing services provided by the HSH and is therefore not described in this PPD.
For a description of the TSD, see the Technical Service Desk — Service Description
[Ref. CS/PRO/148].)

3 Overview

The following helpdesk service will be provided by Fujitsu Services:

e The HSH, which provides Post Office Ltd branch staff with a single point of
contact for dealing with some problems relating to the Horizon system installed in
branches, and also for OBCS fallback encashments. Additionally it provides a single
point of contact for operational issues concerning the Horizon system from pre-
determined sources within Post Office Ltd. Any calls received which are
inappropriate to this helpdesk may be re-directed to the NBSC (Network Business
Support Centre).

Call logging

The operator will attempt to resolve or diagnose the problem during this initial
telephone call. The information will be recorded as an incident onto a helpdesk system
and allocated a unique call reference number.

At the end of the call the operator will inform the caller of the call identity number and
what action to expect next. This identity number should be recorded by the caller and
quoted if the caller needs to ring the HSH about this incident. The caller will be
advised if it is known that the problem relates to a major incident affecting multiple
branches.

If the caller’s query/problem is not resolved within the initial telephone call, the HSH
will advise the caller the date/time by which they will next receive contact. (This
contact will take the form of either a site visit by an engineer or a telephone call from
someone in the Fujitsu Services support chain.)

There are two types of requirement for authorised-user password access:

e Planned, i.e. from Post Office Ltd Auditors in the case of an Audit visit, or Retail
Network Managers/Retail Line Managers/Performance Improvement Advisors in
the case of a planned branch closure.

e@ Unplanned, i.e. when a branch manager forgets their password or becomes locked
out of the system by repeated incorrect entry of their password.

The authorised-user password is issued by the HSH once the caller has been verified
by the NBSC.

The caller requiring authorised-user password access will call the NBSC and obtain
verification and a unique reference number. The NBSC will then call the HSH quoting
this unique reference number. The HSH will then call the branch asking for the unique
reference number and ask them to perform the authorised-user password procedure
sequence following instructions from the HSH. This will allow access to the system.

The authorised-user password is valid for one session only. When the caller logs out,
the authorised-user password can no longer be used. Where the caller has forgotten the
password it is a priority for them to set up a new password for normal use, using the
procedures described in the CSR+ ACUA PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/090].

The system requires the authorised-user procedure sequence to be completed within
five minutes of being started.

Non-branch callers to the HSH

The HSH is available to take incident calls from sources other than Post Office Ltd
branches. These sources are NBSC, TIP and OSG for Post Office Ltd operational calls
and from within Fujitsu Services.

These non-branch callers will be pre-authorised by the allocation of a dummy FAD
code (PATH code). This PATH code is allocated by Fujitsu Services who will agree
the incident types available to be registered via this route.

Non-branch call sources

4.3.5.1 Post Office Ltd

Post Office Ltd incidents affecting the EPOSS (Electronic Point of Sale Service), APS
(Automated Payments Service) or reference data services that arise in the Post Office
Ltd environment will also be reported to the HSH in accordance with agreed
procedures.

43.5.2 NBSC

In the event of an unplanned post office closure, the affected post office will contact
the NBSC and inform them. The NBSC will then contact the HSH on behalf of the
affected post office to register an incident. The NBSC operator will need to quote the
post office FAD code, their name and telephone number and the nature of the problem
(see the CSR+ Operating Environment PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/097].

4.3.5.3 Fujitsu Services

4.3.6

Incidents arising from within the Fujitsu Services operation will result in a call to the
HSH. Callers from within the Fujitsu Services operation will also have to pass the
same verification procedure as a branch by providing a dummy FAD code or PATH
code and name to access the HSH.

Call escalation

Call escalation can be interpreted in three separate ways:

e An incident passed through the support chain for resolution.
e SLA (Service Level Agreement) targets in jeopardy.

e A customer unhappy with the service.

4.3.6.1 Incident passed through the support chain

Once an incident is registered onto the HSH incident management system, it is likely to
be passed along the support chain to different support groups who are responsible for
different areas of the system, e.g. Networks. The HSH staff have visibility of all
incidents and will track progress of the call throughout its life.

4.3.6.2 SLA targets in jeopardy

Should the SLA targets of a particular incident approach or pass minimum SLA levels,
the HSH staff will begin to escalate visibility of this situation, using a manual escalation
process to ensure timely escalation into Fujitsu Services, its supplier, and Post Office
Ltd where appropriate.

This escalation procedure may utilise a problem manager at a predetermined point. The
problem manager will be responsible for ensuring that the correct management and
resources are in place to resolve the problem and restore the service levels. The
problem manager will be supported by an agreed cross-boundary escalation process
that covers the Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services organisations, should disputes of
ownership and responsibility arise.

4.1.6.3 Customer unhappy with service

The caller’s view of escalation will arise should the caller be unhappy with the service
provided or disagree with the progress or actions taken to resolve a particular incident
The caller will contact the NBSC to register his or her dissatisfaction

All complaint calls will be brought to the attention of Fujitsu Services Service
Management and are available to the Service Management Forum if requested.

Inappropriate calls

The HSH may be mistakenly contacted by persons not authorised to use the HSH.
These callers will be unable to pass verification and will be refused access, an incident
call will be recorded on the HSH incident management system.

Should the caller be authorised to contact the HSH and pass verification the HSH
operator will establish the nature of the caller and if the issue is outside the
responsibility of the HSH the caller will, where applicable, be re-directed to the correct
helpdesk. An incident will be recorded on the HSH incident management system.

Callers requiring re-direction to another helpdesk will be supplied with the phone
number of the appropriate desk, if known.

Call redirecting

If the HSH receives a call that is not appropriate to the HSH, where possible the HSH
operator will advise the caller to ring the appropriate number. Where applicable the
HSH operator will supply the phone number of the appropriate desk.

Contingency

The HSH service is provided from one site. Should this site become unable to take
calls, within four hours Fujitsu Services will provide the following services from
another site: telephony and call logging, the FAD list and the OBCS stop list. During
the switchover time, the NBSC will take all calls.

If a problem arises in using the equipment installed at the
branch, e.g. because the equipment is damaged, the branch
manager or branch staff will ring the HSH to gain access to
suitable support. The caller will be required to make a note of
the activity being performed when the problem arose, before
the HSH is called.

In the event of a branch PC system failure or a peripheral
failure, the HSH will allocate an engineer to attend the post
office. The caller will be told when the engineer is expected
to arrive:

The engineer will normally carry spare parts with him;
however occasionally spare parts may need to be couriered to
the post office. In this instance the engineer will arrive shortly
after the spare part has been delivered. The post office will be
informed in advance to expect a spare part to be delivered.
Once at the post office the engineer will replace the faulty
part, test its operation and then check that the branch
manager is happy that the system is now operational. The
engineer will remove any broken equipment when he leaves.

If equipment is damaged the engineer will complete a report
on the circumstances surrounding the damage which will be
agreed and signed by the branch manager.

For more details see the CSR+ Operating Environment PPD
[Ref. CS/PRO/097].

Problem

Description

Communication

failed, could not get
security data

If a member of the branch staff reports that the system
displayed a message during a POLO procedure to say that
communication with the centre failed and it could not get
new security data, the HSH will establish the cause of the
failure.

e Ifthe branch is not currently authorised to collect the
security data (for example, because an authorisation
granted by the automated systems has expired), the HSH
will invoke the necessary authorisation (known as
“opening the door’). If the HSH are unable to do this, the
incident will be passed into the Fujitsu Services support
organisation.

¢ Ifthe branch cannot communicate with the centre via the
WAN, then the HSH will ensure that the communications
problem is resolved.

The HSH may advise the branch to continue using the old
security data whilst the problem is being resolved.

LAN failure

(disconnected node)

WAN failure
(ISDN)

Satellite/PES

Unable to contact

HQ

The network is monitored centrally and any fault will most
likely be resolved before it becomes visible to the post office.
However, should the post office encounter networking
difficulties the HSH should be contacted. Networking
difficulties are likely to show themselves as messages saying
that the central system cannot be contacted. If this occurs, a
member of the branch staff should contact the HSH who will
take details of the network fault.

The fault will be investigated and corrected by support staff
who will inform the branch manager when the network link
has been restored. In the event of a LAN or WAN failure, the
HSH will allocate a Fujitsu Services or BT engineer as
appropriate to attend the post office. The caller will be told
when the engineer is expected to arrive.

Hardware swap/
adjustment due to
network error

The engineer will report the action taken to resolve the LAN
or WAN failure.

(Should a member of the branch staff wish to cancel a
planned engineer visit, they should contact the HSH.)

5.12 Security

Problem

Description

Authorised-user
password required

Passwords within an office are controlled by the manager, and
if a member of staff forgets their password the manager can
reset it. If the manager forgets their password they should
contact the NBSC; an emergency password can then be issued
by the HSH using the authorised-user password procedure to
allow them to reset their own password. Audit staff will also
need access to the system and require use of the authorised-
user service to gain access. Each person authorised to use this
service will be pre-registered and will have to undergo a
verification procedure before access to the authorised-user
service is permitted.

Once verified the caller will be issued with a password that is
valid for only one session and cannot be used again. (Further
information on using authorised-user passwords is given in the
CSR+ Access Control and User Administration PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/090].)

System access issue

The HSH is available to offer advice if user error occurs
during POLO (for example, a PIN mistype), or to provide
guidance on powering up or safely powering down the system
(for example, during power outages).

If the manager forgets their password/gets locked out, then
the caller is referred to the NBSC for the provision of an
authorised-user password, or advised in the case of user error.

(If a clerk/supervisor forgets their password/gets locked out
and contacts the HSH, then the call is dealt with as an
inappropriate helpdesk call on a POL Horizon issue (see
Section 5.6).)

5.13 Software

Problem

Description

Active PMMC or
PIN lost

Each time a PC is powered on, the Post Office Log On
(POLO) procedure must be performed. The branch manager is
issued with a PMMC card plus a spare and PIN when the
equipment is installed. This card and PIN must be kept in
separate secure locations and used when the equipment is
powered on after being switched off as described in the CSR+
Access Control and User Administration PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/090].

If the active card or PIN is lost, the HSH must be contacted.
The HSH operator will ask a series of questions to verify the
identity of the caller and then pass the caller on to a second-
line support technician. The technician will then assist the
branch manager to generate a new PIN or allocate a PIN to
the spare card. This process involves the caller following
verbal instructions from the HSH technician. In extreme cases,
where the system cannot generate the PIN easily, the caller
will be taken through the underlying recovery process that
involves typing a 15-character Fallback Response Code into
the Horizon system.

The new PIN must be stored securely as instructed in the
CSR+ Access Control and User Administration PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/090]. In the case of a lost card, this procedure
invalidates the lost card and a replacement card is ordered for
issue to the post office to use as a spare.

(For the loss of both cards or just the spare card, see Section
5.5 Hardware.)

Key refresh —
update security data

When a key refresh is required, the manager of the branch will
receive a memo via the Memo View facility advising them to
update the PMMC. They may contact the HSH if they need
assistance in performing the security data update process.

This call is also used by the Fujitsu Services Horizon Incidents
Team where a branch needs to be contacted and asked to
complete the security update.

Security data was
unusable

If a member of the branch staff reports that the system
displayed a message during a POLO procedure to say that the
security data received was unusable, the HSH will advise the
caller to retry the procedure. If the fault recurs, then the
incident will be passed into the Fujitsu Services support
organisation.
