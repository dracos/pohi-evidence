Abbreviation Definition

APS Automated Payments Service (Schedule 18)

AP Client Automated Payments Client

AP Agent The term given to Clients who receive file transmission direct from Fujitsu

Services. Clients who are not Agents, receive their files indirectly, via a
Client acting as their Agent.

ccD Contract Controlled Document
Fujitsu Services Fujitsu Services (Post Office Account) Ltd
Live Client An AP Client becomes live when the physical connection is established and

configuration completed such that Client transactions can be passed across
the interface. The Client is then considered live until the Client connection
service is terminated and files cannot be transmitted. This is at a mutually
agreed time, typically at least one month subsequent to Client Token
termination, to allow the harvesting, from the branches, of any delayed
Client transactions.
