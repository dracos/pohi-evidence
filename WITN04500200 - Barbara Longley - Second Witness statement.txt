                      POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




          SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF BARBARA LONGLEY




I, MS BARBARA LONGLEY, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1.    This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the

      "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request provided to me on 16

      January 2023 (the "Request"), some of which were subject to further

      clarification by the Inquiry by way of separate email dated 18 January 2023, to

      the extent I have or had direct knowledge of such matters. In preparing this

      witness statement, I have been assisted by Morrison Foerster, the recognised

      legal representatives for Fujitsu Services Limited in the Inquiry. Morrison

      Foerster did not assist me in relation to my first witness statement dated 12

      September 2022 ("First Witness Statement"), which I prepared with

      assistance from the Inquiry.


2.    The topics set out in the Request concern events that occurred between 17 and

      27 years ago. In this statement, I have set out my best recollection of these

      events, which build upon information provided in my First Witness Statement

      and relate to calls (also known as PinICLs, Peaks or incidents) regarding the

                                                                                  WITNO4500200




     Horizon IT system ("Horizon"). While I have tried my best to remember these

     events, due to the time that has passed and the clerical nature of my role, which

     I explain further below, my ability to remember and provide information

      concerning these events is limited.


3.   As requested by the Inquiry, I have reviewed the documents referenced by the

     Inquiry in the Request. These documents are referenced WITN0450100_02/1

     to WITN045010002/14 and are set out in the index accompanying this

     statement.


GENERAL QUESTIONS RELATING TO MY FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT

The SSC Co-ordinator role

4.   As I state in the First Witness Statement, I joined the Software Support Centre

     ("SSC") as SSC Co-ordinator in 1998. I retired from work, leaving the SSC and

     Fujitsu, in September 2005.


5.   The SSC Co-ordinator role was clerical. My responsibilities in relation to

     Horizon included assigning calls to technicians in the SSC by reference to their

     areas of expertise (this is explained in more detail below), arranging rotas,

     maintaining annual leave records, photocopying, scheduling appraisals and

     managing stationery and the post. My role was not technical, and I provided no

     technical input in relation to Horizon during my time in the SSC.


6.   I was the only SSC Co-ordinator in the SSC and generally work from 9AM to

     5PM. Outside of business hours, a duty technician in the SSC would perform

     my role.




                                   Page 2 of 12
                                                                                   WI TNO4500200
                                                                                 WITNO4500200




7.   I remember that, as SSC Co-ordinator, the process for receiving and assigning

     calls was as follows:


        a. The first line support team at Fujitsu (known as the "Horizon Helpdesk")

           would put calls on my `stack' in the form of Peaks/PinICLs. The calls

           would come in on my screen, and I would read each call and allocate it

           to an SSC technician.


        b. The SSC technicians were specialised in different areas of Horizon, and

           I would allocate the call to an SSC technician based on the area that the

            call appeared to relate to. I would try and determine this by looking for

           key words in the Peak/PinICL. I knew which SSC technicians did what,

           and I would check with them before allocating the call. If I was unsure of

           which area of the system a call related to, I would ask an SSC technician

           to clarify. There were generally multiple technicians who specialised in

           each area, so other factors I would consider were their workload, and

           whether they were on personal leave or annual leave at the relevant

           time.


        c. I do not recall there being any particular challenges to allocating calls

            because I could always check with the SSC technicians or SSC manager

           if I was unsure about whether I was allocating the call to the right SSC

           technician. Sometimes, the SSC technicians would let me know that they

           wanted to work on a particular call, because they were interested in the

            problem or issue that was reported, or because it related to work that

           they had done previously.




                                   Page 3 of 12
                                                                                       WI TNO4500200
                                                                                     WITN04500200




         d. I did not prioritise calls, which would be prioritised before coming into the

             SSC, and did not have the technical knowledge to personally override a

             priority already set by first line support. The SSC technicians would

             sometimes ask me to change the priority of the call but I do not recall

             them explaining why the changes were necessary.


         e. The SSC worked in the same area of the office in Bracknell, and this

             process of confirming and discussing call allocations was mostly done in

             person. I would walk over to the SSC technicians and SSC manager if I

             needed to ask a question about an allocation or any other matter.


8.    After the call had been allocated to the SSC technician, I would update calls as

      instructed as investigations progressed. As part of this work, I would update

      calls and take actions on the system as directed by the SSC technicians, the

      SSC manager and other teams. I would also update calls to record

      communications between SSC technicians and others, including other Fujitsu

      teams, Post Office Counters Limited ("POCL") and users (for example,

      postmasters), to the extent that I was provided with the information and asked

      to include it.


9.    For example, I would sometimes be telephoned by the Fujitsu Horizon

      Helpdesk when they needed an update on the progress of the call from the

      SSC technician. I would then let the SSC technician know, so that they could

      contact the caller to provide an update. I would make entries in the call to record

      these communications.


10.   All of my call entries were based on information provided to me by SSC

      technicians and others, and I would type in what they said to me over the phone,


                                     Page 4 of 12
                                                                                      WI TN04500200
                                                                                    WITNO4500200




      in person at my desk, or I would copy and paste their notes and emails into the

      call (see, for example, WITN0450100_02/1). I had (and still have) no technical

      understanding of the content of the entries I was inputting. I did not provide any

      technical input into these entries, make decisions about how an investigation

      should be progressed, and I never closed calls on my own initiative. All updates

      and closure instructions came to me in various forms from SSC technicians and

      other teams, including assigning calls to other teams and closure categories

      (see, for example, WITN045010002/2 and WITN0450100_02/3).


11.   I did not deal with users, including postmasters or others working at Post Office

      branches, by phone or by email. Users could not contact me at the SSC, as my

      phone number was never provided. Neither did my role involve making phone

      calls to users. User contact was with the Horizon Helpdesk, and SSC

      technicians would sometimes contact users.


12.   I cannot recall how frequently I would receive or manage calls involving known

      errors on Horizon, known workarounds, or problems that were categorised as

      user error. I did not decide on these matters within the SSC, which were the

      responsibility of SSC technicians and the SSC manager. For the reasons I have

      explained above, I do not, and did not, have the technical knowledge or

      experience to understand the substance of the calls that I was allocating. In

      reviewing the documents that the Inquiry has provided to me, however, I noted

      that page 109 of the Expert Witness Report of Charles Cipione dated

      14 September 2022 ("Expert Witness Report") (WITN0450100_02/4)

      describes a monthly ICL Pathway report that seems to contain information

      about the SSC.

                                                                                    WITNO4500200




Horizon Rollout

13.   In the Request, the Inquiry has asked me to clarify my involvement in the

      Horizon roll out and asked that I explain how my statements at paragraph 3 of

      the First Witness Statement are consistent with my statements at paragraphs

      20 and 22 of the First Witness Statement.


14.   At the time of writing the First Witness Statement, I did not recall that the

      Horizon roll out had taken place from 1999 to 2000. 1 still do not recall any roll

      out having taken place. I was, however, aware of new releases. If a roll out did

      take place during my time as the SSC Co-ordinator, the role I would have

      performed would have in no way differed from my role at any other time.


My involvement in meetings with POCL

15.   As requested by the Inquiry, I have considered paragraph 51 of the witness

      statement of David McDonnell dated 3 November 2022 (WITN0450100_02/5)

      and lines 1 to 8 of the transcript of Mr McDonnell's hearing on 16 November

      2022.


16.   I was never an employee of POCL, or a POOL representative', and I did not

      attend any meetings involving POCL and ICL Pathway Limited (or Fujitsu). As

      a non-technical clerical worker, I would have had no place in meetings relating

      to the design and development of Horizon.


17.   As SSC Co-Ordinator, my role also required me to remain at my desk to answer

      phone calls that were coming into the SSC. During my breaks, the duty

      technician would cover me, including to answer calls.




                                    Page 6 of 12
                                                                                         WI TNO4500200
                                                                                       WITNO4500200




18.   I cannot say whether POOL would have known there were problems with the

      Electronic Point of Sale Service system by the very nature of my entries on

      various Peaks because (i) I was never a POOL employee or `POOL

      representative', (ii) I did not provide any technical input in relation to calls, and

      (iii) my entries on various calls were made for record-keeping purposes and

      under instruction from others.


My involvement in Peaks and PinICLs

19.   As requested by the Inquiry, I have considered section 16 of the Expert Witness

      Report (WITNO450100_02/4), and paragraphs 3, 9 and 24 of the First Witness

      Statement.


20.   The Inquiry has asked me to comment on a table in the Expert Witness Report

      listing '[uJsers involved" in PinICLs and Peaks, which notes I was involved in

      more PinlCLs and Peaks than any other operative in the period 1996 to 2000.

      As I have mentioned above and in the First Witness Statement, as SSC Co-

      ordinator, my role included assigning calls to SSC technicians, adding entries

      to PinICLs and Peaks to record communications from others, and closing calls

      upon instruction from SSC technicians. For these reasons, it does not surprise

      me that my name appears more frequently on PinICL and Peak records than

      any other individual during my time as SSC Co-ordinator. I was "involved" in

      the PinICL or Peak, but the nature of my involvement was clerical, not technical.

      I understood that these incidents were reports of issues with Horizon, and the

      SSC technicians were investigating and dealing with them. I did not understand

      the technical nature of the issues being raised and dealt with and the words in

      the PinICL I Peak records are not my own.

                                                                                       WI TNO4500200
                                                                                     WITNO4500200




21.   At paragraphs 3 and 9 of the First Witness Statement, I state there were no

      complaints about how I would assign calls to SSC technicians based on the

      areas that the technicians were specialised in. I was referring to internal Fujitsu

      complaints about the way calls were handled by the SSC. In fact, I received

      very good feedback on my performance in my performance reviews.


PEAK ENTRIES

22.   As requested by the Inquiry, I have considered WITNO450100_02/6 to

      WITNO450100_02/8, which are a series of Peaks. The Inquiry has asked me to

      consider and explain specific entries made in these Peaks, which were

      recorded by me or others.


23.   For the reasons that I have set out above, particularly in paragraphs 7 to 10, I

      cannot explain technical matters relating to Horizon or the technical content of

      the entries, including the bases upon which decisions were taken to close a

      call, explaining and interpreting what SSC technicians meant by their entries,

      or whether there was adequate accountability between the teams to resolve

      issues. SSC technicians and SSC managers may be in a better position to

      explain these matters.


24.   Having    considered     the   Peaks   exhibited    at   WITNO450100_02/6       to

      WITNO450100_02/8, I do remember the following:


         a. When allocating a call to SSC technicians, I would review the call

             summary, which I believe was written by the Horizon Helpdesk and

             copied automatically to the Peak / PinICL record in the `stack'. If there

             was an obvious typographical error, or the summary was unclear but

             written in a way where I could make obvious changes to improve its


                                     Page 8 of 12
                                                                                     WI TNO4500200
                                                                                 WITN04500200




            content, I would reword or shorten the summary to make it clearer. SSC

            technicians would also tell me to change the summary and suggest a

            better description in some instances.


         b. Although I would have updated Target Releases in Peak / PinICL

            records, I would only have done so at the instruction of SSC technicians.

            I did not (and do not) understand the meaning of the different release

            names. I do, however, recall that the SSC manager would inform the

            team when a release had been rolled out so that the next Target Release

            could be used.


         c. I would be told the reasons for needing to reassign a call to other

            members of the SSC if I had misassigned the call. These reasons would

            vary, and included the SSC technician not having time to manage the

            call, another SSC technician having better knowledge and experience to

            deal with the call, or by agreement between the SSC technicians. As

            explained above in this statement, I would generally discuss the

            allocation of calls with SSC technicians to avoid this from happening.


         d. As I state above at paragraph 7(d), calls would be prioritised before

            being received by the SSC. I would change the priority of calls if asked

            by an SSC technician or the SSC manager. I cannot recall the priority

            categories, however I remember that the highest priority was given to

            calls where the Post Office branch was not operating. The SSC would

            drop everything to respond to these calls, even if that meant they had to

            stay behind and work late.


25.   I do not recall who "PowerHelp" and "EPOSS-FP" were or their role.


                                  Page 9 of 12

                                                                                 WITNO4500200




26.   Given the clerical nature of my role, I cannot comment on the adequacy of the

      processes followed to resolve issues with Horizon.


Peak PC0065021

27.   In relation to WITN0450100 02/1, I have reviewed the Peak entries made at

      4.23pm on 6 August 2001, 8.23am and 8.24am on 7 August 2001, and 12.12pm

      on 13 August 2001.


28.   While I cannot remember making these entries, it appears the entries I made

      at 4.23pm on 6 August 2001 and 8.23am on 7 August 2001 were based on

      information provided by others. The entry at 4.23pm on 6 August 2001 notes

      that "Becky from Manchester" will email me the transaction details given by the

      subpostmaster and I will "paste" them into the call. The entry at 8.23am on 7

      August 2001 appears to contain transaction details and the reference ends with

      "thanks Becky".


29.   The entry made at 12.12pm on 13 August 2001 does not appear to have been

      made by me but appears to be based on information provided by the Horizon

      Helpdesk.


Other Peak Records

30.   The Inquiry's questions in relation to the remaining Peak records provided to

      me (WITN04501000219 to WITN045010002/14) were of a discrete technical

      nature.


31.   As explained above, and in my First Witness Statement, my role as SSC

      Coordinator was purely clerical. I had no technical understanding of how

      Horizon worked and was not involved in the substance of how issues with



                                  Page 10 of 12
                                                                                              W I TNO4500200
                                                                                        WITN04500200




         Horizon were investigated and resolved. Unfortunately, I am not therefore able

         to assist the Inquiry with the technical questions it has asked me. I suggest that

         the Inquiry asks these questions to SSC technicians or SSC managers instead

         who have a technical understanding of the system.


Statement of Truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.
