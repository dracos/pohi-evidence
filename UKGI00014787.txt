Signature C Woodbridge

!am the person named above and am employed by Post Office Ltd, part of the Royal Mail Group. I have
been employed by the Royal Mail Group for 35 years. My current role is that of a Business Development
Manager, although up until recently, I was employed as a Rural Support Manager. I dealt with a number of
rural Post Offices, including those in the Reading (RG) postcode area.

On 06 March 2006; Ms Kam Matharu from the National Federation of Subpostmasters contacted me and
stated that it had come to her attention, following a conversation with Mrs Josephine Hamilton that there
might be a problem at South Warnborough Post Office, Alton Road, South Warnborough, Hook, RG29
1RS. Mrs Hamilton was the Subpostmaster of South Warnborough Post Office at the time. As such, I
contacted Post Office Ltd Area Office 18 based in Bournemouth, which covered the RG postcode area at

the time. I spoke to Mr Adrian Skinner, Area Performance Manager and advised him of my conversation
with Ms Matharu.
