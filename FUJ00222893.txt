I am not sure what the question was for item 1.4 since it does not appear to be in this e-mail trail. What I should point
out is that the document attached is very old and has been withdrawn. The End to End reconciliation reporting
document is SVM/SDM/SD/0020.

PSA for responses so far, previously delivered.

¢ @ Pete Jobson — please look in the attached for a question (RFI 1.4 (POL-0032932.doc attached);
This is about the purpose of setting exception F99 in the NB102 rules concerning Network Banking End to End
Reconciliation (in old Horizon?).
We think this needs Pete’s input.) it is felt you could input to.

The suggestion is that SSC (cc’) might need to help with many of the questions.
Also Gareth Jenkins is suggested — do you want me to call him in?
