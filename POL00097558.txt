All
We have received the first three Spot reviews from the Second Sight Investigators (attached).

These are the ones that don’t involve the examination of Horizon XML data, so probably are not representative of the
majority, but gives us something to start on.

At our meeting on Thursday I'd like us to review these cases and have an open discussion on how best to respond to
them; eg assign responsibilities, agree timelines, review process etc.

Regards, Simon
