Infrastructure FUJITSU

@ 3 key changes made to networks:
® Configuration change made to the SAP backup server to prevent it
multicasting — traffic hitting all ports on the Bladeframes

2 All VLANs were trunked to all B/F uplinks (by design) to enable any
VLAN to be accessible to any physical Bladeframe port (allowed a
pserver image to be dynamically moved to a different blade/interface
without requiring any network change to be made) — this facility has been
removed (possibly temporarily) as the Bladeframe virtual switches do not
seem to have the intelligence to only pick out traffic for VLAN’s active on
the vswitch — call raised with Egenera on latter point

® Fault found in the rspan configuration which was resulting in all traffic
destined for the IDS being spanned more than required

@ Net result:- network traffic load on all physical Bladeframe interfaces has
reduced significantly and looks generally much cleaner

® Monitoring for packet loss and increased RTT’s ongoing

® Still have option of redistributing key servers across the reths as discussed
with POL 2 weeks ago and setup on VOL
