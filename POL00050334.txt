On Thursday 18" July 2008 Post Office Ltd Auditors Mike Webb, Mick Renshaw and Dave
Longbottom carried out an audit at Jesmond SPOB. Mr Webb reported a £46,049.16 shortage
in the accounts.

On Friday 19m September 2008 I visited the office of Mr Sunil Khanna to take a statement. Mr
Khanna declined the offer to have a friend present. Mr Khanna gave an overview of the
running of the office and denied the theft of the money.

Later that day Mr Peter Holmes attended Mr Khann’s office. I introduced myself and Chris
Knight, Security Advisor who was now in attendance. Mr Holmes was cautioned and completed
form GS001. Mr Holmes agreed to a voluntary search of his home premises and car. Mr
Holmes declined the offer of a friend to be present. All relevant forma were completed. Mark
Hadrell, Royal Mail Senior Criminal & Liaison Manager attended as third officer.

The search of Mr Holmes’ home produced several financial documents. The search of the car
revealed no evidence.

Mr Holmes was interviewed after the search at the Office of Mr Sunil Khanna. Mr Holmes was
again cautioned and completed side B of form GS001. He further declined the offer of a friend
to be present and completed form GS003.

Mr Holmes denied theft of the money however admitted false accounting over a period of no
less than 9 months.

Horizon data has been requested to ascertain when Mr Holmes started producing false cash
declaration and subsequently false accounts.

Mr Holmes made allegations the Horizon equipment was faulty over a period of time in early
2008. A request has been made to ascertain if this was the case.

These papers are submitted for the current position to be noted.
