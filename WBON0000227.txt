Hi Charlie

We have now sent all 7 of the additional bug reports to the Counsel team below. Can I please ask you to:

With the exception of bug 23, check all new documents embedded in the bug reports are on your disclosure tracker

In relation to bug 23, this includes the embedded NBSC call logs. I asked separately this afternoon for you to check if
these have been disclosed but understand from speaking to Michael that it is unlikely they have been. If this is the
case and they haven't been disclosed, do not add these to your tracker as I've asked the Counsel team (email below)

if these need to be disclosed.

I hope the above makes sense but call if it would be useful to discuss.

Kind regards

Rebecca, Simon,

As promised, please find attached copies of the 7 additional bug reports. As discussed yesterday, these have not
been reviewed by Andy. I have included our queries regarding disclosure and the addition of documents to the trial
bundle in the below table below. In terms of timings for adding documents to the trial bundle, we propose to keep a
record of any and add these to the list Tony sends through before trial so that everything can be added in one go,
unless you need the trial bundle references sooner.

Kind regards

Katie

precisely how long it would take to
obtain this but my initial view was not to

further disclosure and potentially draw
