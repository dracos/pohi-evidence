3 Meeting Objectives

TACTICAL REVIEW.

Key goal:
identify changes that should be made to how we operate Horizon Online,
how the current system is monitored, and where chan ges should be made to
the key architecture components to reduce the risk of system outages

Areas to cover:

* Identification and review of all critical components that impact the
delivery of an acceptable Horizon service — where would changes to
components reduce the risk of system outage

© Operational review covering change management, preventative
maintenance, resilience and failover testing, how critical
components and monitored, whether our monitoring is correctly
aligned to business services

* Review application development and maintenance (including
reference data and system configuration data) to identify
improvements in how availability, resilience, and system integrity is
engineered and tested

‘Approach includes:

Independent input from Fujitsu service tower SME’s

Review of major incidents in terms of ‘reasons for unavailability’ and general
principles that can be applied across other domains

Mapping critical business transactions to the depen dent components
(hardware, software, services)

Review of operational and application development and maintenance
practises

5.3 Resilience & Failover Testing

At the start of each year Fujitsu and Post Office review and agree a plan for resilience and failover testing
of Horizon Online. During 2011 there were 28 operational exercises where live systems were tested. All
observations are recorded and tracked to conclusionin the end of year report.

One of the limitations of this approach is that itis not possible to simulate all the operational failure
modes that could occur within a sub system. However the test plans are optimised to maximise the scope
of the testing.

5.4 Monitoring

The configuration of event monitoring systems is under continual improvement by Fujitsu's enterprise
management team to reflect new information from recent incidents. Fujitsu have developed extremely
detailed transaction monitoring to determine the occurrence and business impact of failures.

However recent incidents have shown the main challenge to be pinpointing the exact source of the failure
in a timely manner when there has been a subtle fault for which the vendor supplied equipment does not
generate alerts.
