Further to Andy's email below, we have been restructuring the Suspense Account paper in light of your comments.

So you know where we are, Rod Ismay is looking at the “top 10” section (point 6 in your email below) and as soon as we
have a fully updated draft, we will circulate it.

Kind regards

Paul

Thanks. We'll re-work and produce a new version asap in line with your comments.

On point 2 — there is no single question posed by SS. Rather they have verbally posed questions over time at Working
Group meetings. The reason for the delay is partly due to SS' questions not being sufficiently clear and partly due to us
taking time to decide on how to address this issue. My recommendation would be to stay away from this topic in the
paper but we can prepare an answer for the meeting with SS.

Kind regards

Thank you for this. It is a considerable improvement but still requires quite a lot of work to complete it.
My feeling is that the running order is wrong. I would suggest.

(1) Executive Summary.

(2) The question asked — are there specific question post July that we need to refer to. Is it clear why this has taken
so long?

(3) Aclear, high-level explanation of what a credit balance is.

(4) The scale of relevant transactions undertaken by POL in the last few years.

(5) The level of credits released from suspense accounts — the 0.01% - do we need 2011/12?

(6) The detailed explanations of the top 10, showing what percentage of the total released they cover. These are

very good on the whole but some are incomplete, there are lots of typos and the Aon one is just too vague. Each

one should end — if we agree - with an identical statement saying that “The existence of the balance in suspense

and the release of the credit to POLs’ p/I account should therefore have no impact on the financial position of

branches.”

Then it may be appropriate to do the section from the front trying to answer “Are the circs where a branch can

be out of pocket?” but this should be shorter and tighter, saying — balances in suspense or their release to p/I

should not impact branch profitability. Separately, if branches do not follow agreed procedures, they can lose

money but that is unrelated to credits in suspense.

(7

If you agree, please let me see another draft. If not, we should talk!!
It would be good to have agreed the wording of this before our session tomorrow morning.

Thanks Al

Please find attached a first draft of the Suspense Account paper. There are a few points that we are still working
on. However, I'd be grateful for your (and anyone else's) thoughts on the general direction of the paper and whether, with
a fresh eye, you think this will satisfy SS.

Kind regards

Hi Al — see below for responses from Andy Parsons (and the responses in red below that). Andy will send through a
timetable shortly. BTW we are still aiming for a meeting with Second Sight on Monday afternoon — can you tell me what
works best for you? Cheers Chris.

Alis referring to the draft paper that Rod sent to me last night - see attached.

It may be useful to talk through with Al his main concern (that we only provide 2 examples rather than a comprehensive
answer). Angela and I have already discussed this with Rod and found that getting clear answers was very difficult. Each
client/product has a different process and therefore the operation of the Suspense Account in relation to each product is
different. Drafting a comprehensive explanation for each product would therefore be a significant task. For this reason,
we focussed the draft paper on two specific examples, banking transactions and ATMs — these being SS' primary areas of
concern.

There is also a wider point that SS are fishing for information when they should be putting forward concrete examples of
how the Suspense Account has operated to disadvantage a SPMR in relation to a particular product or

transaction. Volunteering too much information may only encourage further fishing and less focus on specific cases.
I've inserted some further comments in Al's email below on his specific questions.

Tom/ Patrick - are you in a position to collate the statistical information that Al asks for at the end of his email? I have
some of this already - happy to discuss.

Kind regards
Andy

Chris et al

In spending the day with Rod, he showed me the draft written response to SS, which I hadn't seen. I am slightly
disconcerted that we still haven't replied to them but as that seems to be the case I have a few observations. It would be
helpful if someone could confirm the diary plan for the next few days - when we reply, when we practice, is Monday on?
etc.

My main issue with the draft is that it doesn't do what they want and begs an obvious question. We effectively give them a
high level overview and then two specific examples. If I was them, I would say "not good enough, give us the specifics for
each material client." So my question is, rather than making them jump through hoops, why don't we just do that?

Secondly, we are very data light. Can we not get across a sense of volumes and values and percentages that would
highlight how small some of his activity is relative to the core - and how much activity there is in the wider business, which
may help them understand why we can't control every detail.

Rod Ismay is compiling this data

Less significantly:

- if our main contention is that there are many different versions of this, why refer to it as a singular Suspense Account?
I'll speak to Rod about getting this further level of detail — the reference to a single account was only there to help simplify
the answer.

- are we really clear that they are only interested in client suspense accounts and not the balancing accounts with the
branches?
Yes — SS have made this clear.

- in para. 2 of page 2 we talk about the various people affected but ignore customers. I would add them in.
Agreed

- I agree we should use "credit" consistently. Have we worked through a logic for a debits, so we can answer that question
if it arises? "Are there any circumstances in which a debit suspense item could leave a branch out of pocket?"
SS have made clear that they are only interested in credits but we can work up an answer on debits just in case.

- we hold strongly to the argument that if a branch has accounted properly it shouldn't be out of pocket. But it opens us up
to the argument that if a badly trained and unsupported branch made errors and were materially out of profit - to our
benefit - that would also be something we had accountability for. What's our answer to that? An example is if they don't
record cheques properly, create a cash shortfall they don't get paid for and don't get the matching cheque benefit?

We'll need to discuss this with Rod Ismay.

- we cover the same. 2 examples twice each and the two could be consolidated to better effect
Agreed

Also could I urgently see a breakdown of the cases in process showing amount claimed, where there has been a criminal
prosecution, where they are in the SS process, what any SS recommendations are etc?

Thanks Al
