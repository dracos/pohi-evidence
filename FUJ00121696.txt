Subject: Clean Start Evidence - Cleveley
Attachments: 04-08-05 Evidence of Clean Start.doc

Attached the final piece of additional evidence that Fujitsu agreed to provide at Tuesday's Conference Call.

Please advise if there are any problems with this. Clearly the Horizon Migration Acceptance Form is a scanned image and
I will not be able to present it in anything other than how it appears here.

Regards,
