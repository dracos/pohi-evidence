Duncan,

We are already on to it.

The position with the Post Office account is that we refer all media enquiries directly to their Press Office, and do not
make a comment of our own. We have spoken with them, and they wish us to maintain the same stance.

I will alert IB/Japan.
If you want me to do anything else, I am happy to.
Simon

Simon, there's an article on BBC regarding Post Office and concerns over the Horizon system. It is an old allegation
which I believe is totally false, however, it is on the news.

Can you alert the IB and Japanese teams please. I suggest we ensure we are aligned with PO press team and also
should have a drawer statement ready to go.

Can you review and update everyone please.

Regards. . . Duncan.
