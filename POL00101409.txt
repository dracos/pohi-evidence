Subject: FW: Sparrow upt f wider rebuttal activity with BBC

In case you haven't already - I'm sure you've been holding off because Nina hasn't been around for the
last few days - here is a reminder to ask Nina to give you a full rundown of wider rebuttal activity with
the BBC.

Hi Paula

I had a long discussion with the editor of the programme which made the error: she apologised and we
discussed how to handle -_her offer was for us to provide a full briefing on the issue when it suits us
rather than broadcast a clarification. This feels like a good result for us - I wasn't really keen on a
clarification as it risks further attention on the ss report.

I'm going to ask Nina to give me a full rundown of wider rebuttal activity with the BBC.

huddle with Chris and the lawyers and we hold that in our back pocket as a potential action if coverage
