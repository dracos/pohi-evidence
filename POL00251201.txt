Dear Ms Joannon

Further to my letter of 16° January, I can now respond more substantively to your
letter of 7** January 2017.

Firstly, thank you for taking the time to set out your issues and concerns for me. I
do fully understand and appreciate the disruption and inconvenience that can be
caused when there is an interruption or change to the services provided by a local
Post Office, and of the impact this can have on the community. We therefore take
very seriously any decision to change the way a branch is operated, and will only do
so when it is warranted by the circumstances of the particular case, for example to
protect customers, Post Office assets or the safety and security of the Post Office
network.

With respect to the Post Office branch at 11 Combe Close, Leicester LE3 9TJ, we
believe we have acted appropriately and indeed lawfully. We accept that the
postmaster of that branch may see things differently, and we are continuing to liaise
with the postmaster to understand their concerns. Given however that this is
essentially a private matter concerning the contractual arrangements Post Office has
with the postmaster, I hope you will understand that it is not appropriate for me to
comment further to someone who is not a party to that contract.

Thank you again for taking the time to write to me.

Yours sincerely

Kevin Gilliland OBE
Chief Executive, Retail
