Short. Balance on 24” September was discussed JM had no
reason why between these dates £2500.00 of stock had gone
missing as far as JM was concerned the stock had been correct at
the previous balance. ;

JM stated she had never had issues with the stock and had no
idea where the stock had gone

Cheques were discussed. SB asked JM how often she cleared her
cheques from the office. JM stated daily and clears them every
day. JM then explained the process she operates regarding the
cheques. Mail man collects the mail at 2 30pm. He also comes at
5.15pm but JM would usually not have completed her reports. She
cuts off her cheques at 5.30pm, puts them in an envelope and
gives them to the mail man at 2.30pm the next day except on a
Friday as instructed not to clear cheques on a Friday. SB
explained cheques should be cleared on a daily basis and he
would query if this was the case on a Friday and her cut off should
be 5.00pm so as the cheques can be given to the mail man at
5.15pm.

SB asked why cheques to the value of £1673.49 were not on hand
when the auditor arrived. JM called the helpline about cheques
several months ago and she followed there instructions. JM still
wasn’t happy with the process and started copying the cheques
before posting. She could not explain why this figure was showing
on the system.

SW stated the Help Desk would be contacted for call logs. sw
asked if JM had mentioned all the issues regarding the cheques
and the cash to anyone else in the Post Office. JM stated, no.

SW asked if anyone had visited the office to discuss sales that she

would have mentioned to them that she was having major
problems and asking for help. JM stated, no.

SB and JM discussed the cheques to establish the average
number of cheques she would have in the Post Office. JM
explained it was difficult as one week you might have £300 and
other times £20,000 in cheques. JM stated the last time she sent
cheques off was the day before they closed.

SB produced SB 3, office snapshot produced by the auditor. JM
agreed the office had not the amount of cash shown on the snap
shot.

JM informed SB that since the audit took place a bundle of prepaid
special delivery envelopes were found at the counter and the
auditor had missed it. SW explained to JM that as Sub Postmaster
it is her responsibility to produce all cash and stock to the auditor.
SB explained the office snap shot and the figures detailed on it.
SB asked JM if she checked her cash against the cash figure on
the snapshot. JM stated she knew there wasn’l that much cash
there

Did you physically count your cash each night

Yes

And then did you compare it with the summary sheet you printed
off Horizon

Yes

But what you are saying is you knew it was wrong

Yes. I knew it was wrong

So I ask you. Why did you bother counting it if you knew it was
wrong, why would you count it

1 counted it every day

SB But why, when you knew it was wrong

JM I just did

SB Why, Oh Look...

JM Have you seen how many transaction corrections our office has
had? It changed daily.

SB The question was, the question was why would you bother
counting your cash if you knew it was wrong.

JM Because you have to put a cash declaration in.

SB Okay. I can understand you have to put a cash declaration in bul 1
can’t work out why you are saying that you didn’t have had
£71520.00 of £20 notes.

JM Right

SB On the ‘1st October, Right. So if you count that in we have got
£520 of £20 notes. What did you input in the machine?

JM Oh I put that in

SB Right so whatever the cash dec was you input it into the machine

figures are. JM stated the figures were what was in the safe, in the
roller cash and the tills. She also stated they were wrong and not
25.21 worth the paper il was written on.

SB asked where she would have got the figure of £65,000.00. JM

] haven't stolen a penny
SB summarised what had been discussed and asked if JM had
stolen the money

Have you stolen it?

No I haven't stolen it
SB suggested other areas as to where the money could be and if

it could be carelessness, incompetence or theft

JM stated she had been having problems with the balancing.
SB discussed the amounts of £50 claimed in the cash decs and
how they had increased from 7800 in April for two weeks and then
this figure increased in June to £14,000.00 £50 notes. Then
£14135.00 claimed which is not devisable by 50. Further

_ discussions took place regarding the untruthfulness of the figures
as JM had stated the last true balance was in March.
SW asked JM if she had kept a manual record of the amounts or
her concerns when money was down. JM stated, no. Discussed
the last balance on 24" September and Katie's involvement with it.
Katie is doing the balance and she is inputting figures. Figures
produced by you. You are saying Katie knew the figures were in
correct. How did she know the figures were in correct
Because she knew we didn’t have that much cash on hand
How would she know that you didn't have that much cash on hand
Because I told her we didn’t have that much cash on hand
because our balance keeps showing that we’ve got more money
that what we have
And what did you say about the figures to her and did she say
anything to you
On this particular day or any day .
