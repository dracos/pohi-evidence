Subject REVIEW OF HORIZON PERFORMANCE AND PROBLEM MANAGEMENT -

POST OFFICE NETWORK

I attach a copy of our final report following our review of the procedures for monitoring and reporting
Horizon performance and problem management.

Although the original terms of reference were agreed with Chris French the report is addressed to Andy
Radka as the recommendations contained in the report relate to Business Service Management.

The report concludes that the processes for identifying problems with the Horizon system in the live
environment are working well, but has made some suggestions for improvements to the processes for
resolving these problems.

All the findings have been discussed with the relevant managers and the Implementation Plan at Part 4
records the actions agreed in respect of the recommendations made. There is one recommendation where
BSM have agreed to determine who within Post Office Network will have responsibility for identifying
and communicating good practice at outlets, and we have agreed to follow this up in one month’s time to
teview the outcome of these discussions.
