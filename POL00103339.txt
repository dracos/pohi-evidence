All

We have a meeting of the Board Litigation Sub-Committee scheduled for 11am on Tuesday morning. I understand that

Tim will be in the US at that time and will therefore be dialling in.

There are no decisions required, however we propose to provide verbal updates as follows:

e General update on the Court process,
* Update on contingency planning
e@ Update on Settlement Options

e AOB

We are preparing a short table which applies a fairly simplistic ‘RAG’ status to the various contingency options and which

will assist the update on contingency planning. This will be circulated ahead of the meeting.

You may recall that I flagged at the previous meeting that I thought it unlikely that the CCRC would choose to release
their report on the criminal cases ahead of the Horizon Issues trial next March. We have now received confirmation

frorn the CCRC to this effect.

Ken, Tom — please let us know if you will be able to attend in person or would also prefer to dial in?

Kind regards,

Jane
