SECRETARY OF STATE’S MEETING WITH MR AKIKUSA (PRESIDENT
OF FUJITSU) AND MR NARUTO (VICE CHAIRMAN OF FUJITSU AND
CHAIRMAN OF ICL) TOKYO, 13 JUNE AT 1800. -

STEERING BRIEF

Horizon: Post Office Automation Project

The speaking notes provided for your meeting with Mr Akikusa and Mr Naruto are
deliberately somewhat fulsome in their gratitude to Fujitsu for supporting ICL
through the difficulties with the Horizon project. We know that these difficulties
caused deep divisions within the Fujitsu Board and that the hard-line element were
particularly outraged when told about the accounting provision required by
Fujitsu’s auditors. It will therefore be important to use the occasion to strengthen
the position of ICL’s friends on the Fujitsu Board by stressing the importance
which the British Government attaches to that support.
