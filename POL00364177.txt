Thanks Andy. Agree with the approach. Nonetheless, I have highlighted a few of these which I think we should
not include - some of them seem a bit problematic to me. But subject to that, from my perspective this is good to
go.

All best

All

As per my discussion earlier today with Gideon, we have added more sections of the Judgment to the attached
statement. Our approach has been to include anything that we might rely on, unless plainly not relevant to the
application. The objective being to avoid any challenge on appeal that a point in the Judgment was not put to
Fraser on the application.

All comments welcomed.

Kind regards
Andy
