1. MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
1d Acceptance is the act of accepting a ICL Pathway Service or Deliverable on

confirming that it meets contracted obligations in accordance with the relevant
Acceptance Criteria. This stage plan indicates the assumptions and broad principles
used for the management of the Horizon Acceptance of Products and Services during
the ICL Pathway Operational Trial. The plan has been developed on PRINCE lines
from the Horizon perspective. The plan specifically deals with Acceptance of the
Operational Trial Service and Deliverables, and the processes to confirm that it meets
contracted obligations.

1.2 Following the present Replan proposals, which are yet to be agreed and contractually
finalised, it is assumed by all parties that the Operational Trial system will be delivered
in three Steps (referred to in the Replan Level 0 as “stages”). It is further assumed
that each Step will be subject to a separate Acceptance activity, culminating in
eventual Acceptance of the Operational Trial Services and Deliverables as a whole,
when all contracted obligations have been met.

1.3 In the Acceptance process both Authorities, that is DSS and POCL, the Sponsors of
Horizon, have sovereign acceptance rights. Horizon is tasked with the management
of the Acceptance process on behalf of both Authorities.

14 The Horizon plans for the management of Acceptance are outlined at the higher level.
The paper goes on to outline the various management organisations and covers the
relationships between Horizon and the Authorities and with ICL Pathway during
Acceptance.

1.5 The purpose of the document is to provide high level guidance for Horizon’s
management of Acceptance activities generally. The paper shows and explains the
various processes involved

1.6 The paper indicates the subordinate Horizon documents which provide detailed
guidance on Acceptance practice, organisation and activities. D.N. This paper, and
the other Horizon Acceptance documents are living documents which will be updated
to reflect any changes in policy and processes which arise.

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of the document is to provide high level guidance for Horizon’s
management of Acceptance activities generally. This paper describes the overall
principles and practice of Horizon’s management of the Acceptance of the ICL
Pathway Operational Trial Services and Deliverables on behalf of DSS and POCL
The paper then sets out the PRINCE style stages of the Horizon Acceptance Plan and
offers the principles for the relationships between Horizon and its Sponsors and
between Horizon and ICL Pathway during Acceptance. The paper includes a number
of process diagrams and accompanying text which explain the practical steps involved
in all phases of Acceptance.

The definitions given in the Glossary at Annex A are those which were offered and
agreed by the Sponsors in Reference 9. They are intended to emphasise aspects
which relate to the Acceptance this process and so do not always exactly equate to
those given in the Related Agreements. The source of those definitions not directly
from the Agreements is indicated at Annex A.

Definition of Acceptance

Acceptance is the act of accepting a ICL Pathway Service or Deliverable on
confirming that it meets contracted obligations in accordance with Acceptance
Criteria [Reference 1]. This paper specifically deals with Acceptance of the
Operational Trial System, and the process to confirm that it meets contracted
obligations. Consistent with the present Replan proposals [References 2 and 3],
which are yet to be agreed and contractually finalised, it is the current working
assumption by all parties that the Operational Trial services and products will be
delivered in three Steps (referred to in the Replan Level 0 as “stages”). It should be
noted that the Horizon three Step approach is not accepted by ICL Pathway. Each
Step will be subject to a separate Acceptance activity, culminating in eventual
Acceptance of the Operational Trial Services and Deliverables as a whole, when all
contracted obligations have been met.

The contents of Pathway New Release 2 are fully defined at Reference 4.
D.N. The assumptions cited here and the breakdown of Acceptance into three Steps
may be altered as a result of the replanning and contract renegotiations which are

ongoing.

The working assumption is that Acceptance Step (1) for ICL Pathway New Release 2
(NR2) Single Benefit will take place once ICL Pathway has demonstrated:

. that ICL Pathway NR2 working against a single benefit Child Benefit (ChB)
meets contracted obligations;

. the Proof of Concept of mobile counter configuration (for outlets at which
Horizon equipment cannot be installed in a permanent position or are installed
in vehicles);

. satisfactory progress in developing NR2+;

. that a satisfactory stage has been reached in preparing for Acceptance Step 2.

PWY REF: BP/PLA/016
2.1.4 Acceptance Step (2) for ICL Pathway NR2 Multiple Benefits will take place once the
ICL Pathway has demonstrated:

. that ICL Pathway NR2 meets contracted obligations when working against
multiple benefits [ChB, Income Support (IS), Job Seeker’s Allowance (JSA)
and Retirement Pension (RP)]; and

. the proof of concept for NR2+.
2.1.5 The contents of Pathway New Release 2 are fully defined at Reference 5.

2.1.6 Acceptance Step (3) for ICL Pathway NR2+ will take place once ICL Pathway has
demonstrated that NR2+ operates against multiple benefits in accordance with
contracted obligations.

2.1.7 All Acceptance activities are directed to Contractual Acceptance. Contractual
Acceptance of the Operational Trial Services and Deliverables has significant
implications to the Programme as payment guarantees come into force, rights of
termination are effected and service levels and remedies apply. Note however, the
working assumption that on Acceptance of Step 1, the Authorities’ termination rights
for failed Acceptance of the Operational Trial System for Step 2 will not be
surrendered.

2.1.8 In the development of the project, the Authorities’ Agreements have been divided
into 24 Acceptance Specification documents. Although the DSS has argued that
Acceptance of the Operational Trial System should be considered against a single
logical Acceptance Specification for each of the three Acceptance Steps, this is not
the contractual position. Acceptance Tests against an Acceptance Specification may
begin as soon as that Specification has been signed-off as agreed by the Authorities
and the Contractor. The Acceptance Specifications for Step I have been developed by
ICL Pathway against the Service Architecture Design Document (SADD) version 4
[Reference 6] to cover NR2. The Acceptance Specifications for the Operational Trial
include Operational Trial Criteria derived as required by Authorities Agreement
Schedule C3.

2.1.9 The drafting of the current Acceptance Specifications had assumed that NR2 would
be operating against multiple benefits. Step 1 NR2 Technical Tests and End to End
(E2E) Tests will be conducted against multiple benefits. Model Office Test and Live
Trial will not test against multiple benefits. Since the Step 1 Model Office Test and
Live Trial acceptance conditions will differ from those for Step 2, modified and
additional Acceptance Specifications will be required for the Step 2 testing of NR2.

2.1.10 The process for the development, review and sign-off of those amended and
additional Acceptance Specifications will follow those used earlier and managed by
Horizon to minimise delays by all parties.

2.1.11 These and other definitions used during Acceptance are listed at Annex A. The
definitions are intended to reflect the usage in the Horizon Acceptance processes. and
complement the definitions in use in the Related Documents.

2.2. Objectives of Acceptance

2.2.1 The strategic Horizon Acceptance Objectives, on behalf of the DSS and POCL, are:

. To fully recommend acceptance of the ICL Pathway Deliverables and Services
only if key contracted obligations are met.

. To provide the means by which the Contracting Authorities may agree with ICL
Pathway that they are capable of delivering the Services contracted for in the
Related Agreements.

. To ensure that the Authorities termination rights and other remedies in the
event of Failed Acceptance are not diluted.

. In the event of Failed Acceptance, to ensure that the provisions allowing for a
cure period may be properly followed. (For example, in the context of the
Operational Trial, failure to cure could lead to termination of the contract).

. In the case of less than complete Acceptance to ensure that the Authorities are
able to accept such part of the Operational Trial System as the Authorities may
decide and to provide the mechanisms where pro-rated charge or otherwise
arrangements may be agreed.

. To maintain synchronisation with the Release Management processes which run
in parallel with Acceptance.

2.3. Assumptions

D.N. The assumptions cited here and the breakdown of Acceptance into three Steps
may be altered as a result of the replanning and contract renegotiations which are
ongoing.

2.3.1 In producing this plan the assumptions outlined in the following paragraphs have been
made in addition to those made about the three Step Acceptance process detailed
above.

2.3.2 Acceptance must follow the procedures defined in the Related Agreements as
amended by formal change control. This plan is based on the assumption that the
evolution of Acceptance of the Operational Trial into a 3 Step process is agreed by all
parties and the Related Agreements are amended under change control. Failing that
agreement, this plan will be amended where applicable..

2.3.3. The Related Agreements are contractually binding and any proposed changes, before
becoming valid, must be formally agreed by the relevant parties via formal change
control.

2.3.4 Contractual Acceptance of the Operational Trial Services and Deliverables constitute
confirmation by the Authorities to ICL Pathway that contracted obligations for the
Operational Trial system have been met. Acceptance at the end of Steps 1 and 2 of
the Operational Trial constitutes confirmation to ICL Pathway that they have met
their contracted obligations for that Step of the Operational Trial, and that they have
made satisfactory progress in the outstanding Step(s).

ICL Pathway are responsible for producing a Testing and Integration Strategy for the
Operational Trial, the Operational Trial Acceptance Specifications and the
Acceptance Criteria contained within them.

The Authorities are responsible for providing Acceptance Test Conditions (although
in the event, those for the Technical Test have been have been produced by ICL
Pathway). (It should be noted that Acceptance Test Conditions have been developed
for Model Office Test and End to End Test and are being developed for Live Trial. It
is expected that this process will be repeated for the changing scope of Steps 2 and 3.)

ICL Pathway are responsible for the production of Business Threads, High Level Test
Plans and Test Scripts to meet the Test Conditions.

The Acceptance Specifications, High Level Test Plans and Test Scripts are based on
the ICL Pathway design for Release NR2. Thus:

. The Acceptance Specifications are Release specific (and may be Acceptance
Step specific) and may not represent the contracted obligations;

. The Acceptance Specifications, and all subordinate documents will have to be
checked before use in later Steps of Acceptance. Where required, this will
entail a repeat of the Acceptance Specification review and agreement process
managed by Horizon.

Horizon are responsible for managing the agreement of the Acceptance
Specifications.

ICL Pathway are responsible for writing all Test Scripts and for designing and
organising the majority of tests which occur during the Operational Trial. Outline
details of those tests which involve Acceptance [extracted from Reference 7] and
notes on Joint Testing [Reference 8] are at Annex B. ICL Pathway are also
responsible for supporting the Model Office Test

Either Authority may at any time request that additional Acceptance Tests be
performed. The conditions under which additional tests might be sought would be
where the tests conducted by ICL Pathway failed to provide adequate evidence that a
Test Condition had been met.

Horizon is responsible for ensuring suitable attendance for the Acceptance Trials and
Reviews.

During the course of the Acceptance Trials, effective management procedures will be
in place to ensure that Acceptance Incidents are managed to resolution in known
versions of software, and for effective retesting and configuration management. The
procedures will produce an audit trail through which it is possible to track from
incident to resolution, identifying each test and software version involved. Up to date
management information, and the audit trail will be made available to the Horizon
Test Manager, Horizon Acceptance Manager, DSS Acceptance Manager, DSS Audit,
the Horizon Acceptance Incident Manager and/or relevant Horizon Acceptance Test
Manager.

3. ACCEPTANCE TEST METHODS
3.1. Acceptance Process
3.1.1 Acceptance is a process for assessing the functionality and performance of the ICL

Pathway Services and the Service Infrastructure prior to National Rollout. Each Step
of Acceptance has three parts: Technical Test, Model Office Test (MOT), End to End
Interface Test (E2E) and Live Trial, save that Step 3 ends with Introduction into Live
Service, rather than Live Trial.

3.1.2 Acceptance Specifications produced by ICL Pathway in fulfilment of a contractual
obligation, but to be agreed by the Authorities, refer also refer to Technical/Security
Testing, Business Integration Test (BIT) and System Test. These are ICL Pathway
owned tests which have their own High Level Test Plans, and form part of
Acceptance Trials. Horizon will seck visibility of the HLTPs and LLTSs for
Technical Tests on behalf of the Sponsors and to confirm that these test documents
are under firm change control.

3.1.3. The ICL Pathway approach to business and technical testing is outlined within the
Principles of Acceptance Trials for ICL Pathway Release NR2 [Reference 8].

3.2. Acceptance in Steps

3.2.1 Step 1 Acceptance Tests will be conducted on the MOR 3 version of Release NR2
and include a Technical Test which is common to Steps I and 2. Step 1 also includes
stand-alone MOT, E2E Test and Live Trial. MOT and Technical Testing can overlap
but should finish in sequence.

3.2.2. Step 2 Acceptance Tests will be conducted on a later version of Release NR2 and
include the Technical Test which is common to Steps 1 and 2. Step 2 also includes its
own stand-alone MOT and E2E Test and Live Trial of Multi-Benefits. MOT and
Technical Testing can overlap but should finish in sequence.

3.2.3. Step 3 Acceptance Tests will be conducted on Release NR2+ and include Technical
Test and stand-alone MOT, E2E Tests and Introduction into Live Usage. MOT and
Technical Testing can overlap but should finish in sequence

3.3. Technical Test

3.3.1 Technical Test is the first phase of each Step to ensure that the ICL Pathway solution
for that stage meets the performance, volume, resilience and operability requirements
of the BA/POCL programme. The objective of the Technical Test in all three Steps is
to confirm that the underlying elements of the Services and the Service Infrastructure
function correctly and to confirm their readiness for the MOT.

3.3.2. The E2E Interface Trial was originally ex-contractual but, having been included in the
Replan proposals, it is assumed that it will be included in the Contract under change
control.

conducted in association with Model Office Rehearsal (MOR). The assumed overall
objectives for the performance of E2E centre on the bringing together of the IT
functionality across all the participating systems, with the operational and business
procedures, to form an overall business system. E2E and MOR activities are planned
and scripted together, run on the same environment, and involve the same personnel.
E2E forms a natural extension of Direct Interface Test (DIT). It is run in parallel
with, but separate from, MOR.

Model Office Test

Model Office Test (MOT) is the second phase of each Step of Acceptance. MOT is a
further test of the Pathway system to provide evidence as to whether the contracted
obligations to both parties have been met. It uses simulated data and as near lifelike
arrangements in a production like environment using actual. Tests are conducted to
ensure the system and manual business processes interact through the use of training
and procedures to meet the overall business needs of the BA/POCL programme.
MOT is designed and run by Horizon in co-operation with ICL Pathway.

The objective of the MOT is to test the Services and the Service Infrastructure in an
environment which simulates (as far as possible without using live operational data)
the live operation of the end to end Services and the Service Infrastructure, and to
confirm their readiness for the Live Trial. [Reference 21]

End to End Interface Test

The End to End Interface Test has been designed to ensure that the integrity of data
remains intact when all systems, including, Pathway, are linked together throughout
the End to End environment. The tests are also required to test some of the lengthier
business procedures across the business domains. User procedures will be used for
tests which cannot be covered during Model Office Rehearsal and Model Office Test.
[Reference 21]

The End to End Interface Test has been designed jointly by representatives of both
systems and business processes working jointly with ICL Pathway and other external
system representatives.

Live Trial

Live Trial, outlined at Reference 11, is the third stage of the first and second Steps in
Acceptance and runs over a core period of 11 weeks. The main elements are:

. the implementation and operation of the Live Trial services, that is the full core
services to be implemented which support the assessment of other areas
including POCL implementation, Service Management, Transaction Timings
and Invoice Production;

. reporting success to Release Management in order for them to authorise the
next release processes;

. identification of improvement opportunities for the ICL Pathway and Sponsor
services and support for Sponsor’s benefit realisation work.

3.6.2 The objective of the Live Trial shall be to test the Services and the Service
Infrastructure with operational data, Users and Customers, to confirm that the
Services and the Service Infrastructure function in the live environment, and to
confirm their readiness for national Roll-Out.

3.6.3. The number of Outlets involved in the Live Trial is defined in the controlled document
entitled “Delivery and Implementation during the Operational Trial Period”. At
present the Live Trial is to involve the 204 existing Outlets plus 100 new Outlets.

3.7. Decision Making - Acceptance of the Release

3.7.1. Each Step will have a final phase which will be the decision making processes of
Horizon and the business Sponsors regarding the Acceptance of the Release. This is
dealt with in the document dealing with the third Step of Acceptance - Contract
Acceptance [Reference 19]. D.N. This paper will be developed and issued following
the outcome of the replan.

3.8. Contract Acceptance
3.8.1 At the end of Step 3, the formal Contract Acceptance processes will include:

. the negotiation with ICL Pathway of any service elements requiring partial
acceptance;

. formal Contract Acceptance of the Operational Trial.

3.9, Audit of Testing and Witnessing Strategy

3.9.1 At the request of its Sponsors, Horizon initiated a tripartite audit of the ICL Pathway
testing process under Terms of Reference approved by the Acceptance Management
Forum [Reference 22].

3.9.2. The audit team have recommended in their report [Reference 23] that witnessing in
relation to contract Acceptance should be defined with its objective and scope as
follows.

. Objective: As part of the contract Acceptance process, to utilise an opportunity
available to the Authorities to obtain independent and objective information
from the performance and results of Pathway testing that the underlying
elements of the Service and Service Infrastructure function correctly.

. Scope: Operating within the Technical Testing stage of Acceptance Trials.

3.9.3 The audit team recommended that the Witnessing strategy to be adopted is selective
witnessing of priority Acceptance areas in services and/or functionality that the
Authorities believe to be of crucial importance, or where there are known or
perceived problems in ICL Pathway’s ability to deliver the functionality. The resulting
approach to witnessing being a combination of “Process and Content Witnessing”

involving a mixture of forward looking and retrospective examination.

3.9.4 In the event, the Acceptance Management Forum have agreed to concentrate on the
“Content” witnessing of remaining Acceptance Trials, of any Acceptance elements of
continuing ICL Pathway testing (such as the BIT Regression Tests) and of course
during the Model Office and End to End Interface Tests and the Live Trial.

3.9.5 The detailed processes for witnessing of Acceptance Trials and the conduct of
Acceptance Reviews are detailed at References 16 and 24 respectively.

ACCEPTANCE TEST ACTIVITIES

Acceptance Trial

Acceptance Trial is one of two methods of testing the acceptability of a Deliverable or
Service (the other being Acceptance Review). Descriptions of one or more
Acceptance Trials will be included as part of each Acceptance Specification. These

Acceptance Trials can consist of one or more inspections, demonstrations, running
real or simulated operational workloads, monitoring the service or presentations.

Acceptance Review

Acceptance Reviews cover any Acceptance scrutiny of the ICL Pathway products,
deliverables and services that are not an actual Acceptance Trial. They include
demonstrations witnessed by Horizon and Sponsor staff, site visits by Horizon and

Sponsor staff, presentations to Horizon and Sponsors, etc., in addition to the actual
review of Deliverable documents and other items. See Reference 24.

Acceptance Specifications

The format for an Acceptance Specification is given in the Related Agreements and
includes:

. a definition of its purpose and scope;

. procedures for raising and resolving Acceptance Incidents. This will probably be
a reference to a standard process and details of any deviations;

. the Acceptance Period e.g. Live Trial;
. the Deliverables and Services covered;

. the acceptance method(s) to be used and thus the events to be organised e.g.
Acceptance Reviews (Document Quality Reviews) or Acceptance Trials;

. the Acceptance Criteria for each Deliverable or Service (the requirements), and
the associated Acceptance Test Conditions;

. guidelines for analysing Acceptance Incidents;

. test data for Acceptance Trials;

. Authorities responsibilities and resources required for each Acceptance
Trial/Acceptance Review.

The Acceptance Implications of Replan

As outlined earlier, the Replan has effectively divided Acceptance into three Steps.
The implications of this are:

att00002.dat Page 5 of 48 12/01/99
POL00029137
POL00029137

RESTRICTED COMMERCIAL

PWY REF: BP/PLA/016
. that Acceptance will be a much longer activity and will require additional
resources;

. the Acceptance Specifications, HLTPs and other supporting documentation
may have to be revised, reviewed and the revisions signed-off for the second
and third Steps, prolonging the Acceptance preparation activities, in parallel
with execution on earlier Steps;

. there may be further adjustments if and when the contracted Acceptance
obligations are contractually altered under current change control activity and
commercial negotiations.

44.2 The creation of two additional Steps requires additional work in revising and
reviewing documents, obtaining witnesses and other resources and completing
reports. The Acceptance Management Forum [defined in Reference 14] is now in
existence and will direct the co-ordination of these new activities.

45. The Acceptance Process

4.5.1 The essential process of each Step of Acceptance is considered to occur in three
phases illustrated at Figure 3 below. There are other associated processes not shown
in the interests of simplicity.

4.6. Horizon Tasks During Acceptance

4.6.1. As explained above, each Step in the Acceptance process involves three phases of
work; Preparation, the actual Testing and Contractual Acceptance activity. The next
three sections detail the processes in those phase in some detail.

5. PHASE 1 - PREPARATION FOR ACCEPTANCE

5.1. Acceptance Specifications Review and Agreement

5.1.1 During this stage the Acceptance Specification for each Acceptance Test is produced
by ICL Pathway and then delivered to Horizon [formerly the PDA] for review and
agreement by the Authorities. The processes involved are shown at Figure 7 below.

PWY REF: BP/PLA/016

5.1.2 The initial stages are the development by ICL Pathway of the Acceptance
Specification, together with other associated documents from the Agreements and the
Acceptance Criteria.. In some cases new Acceptance Criteria have been developed to
represent new requirements of the changes in the solution which have been mutually
agreed between Horizon and ICL Pathway. The Acceptance Specifications are
delivered to the Horizon Team for recording in the Horizon Library and for the
formal review process.

5.1.3. Horizon conducts a formal quality review using a panel of reviewers from relevant
parts of the Sponsor organisation or organisations; their activities and the collation of
comments being the responsibility of the nominated Horizon Acceptance Test
Manager. DSS reviews and comment collation are co-ordinated by the DSS
Acceptance Manager. POCL reviews and collation are the responsibility of POCL
Business Assurance. The review, consolidation of comments and subsequent
negotiations with ICL Pathway are managed by a nominated “document guardian”,
more correctly the Acceptance Test Manager.

5.1.4 If there is consensus that the Specification is fit for purpose in the Acceptance process
the Acceptance Test Manager and their ICL Pathway opposite number will notify
those concerned that the Specification is ready for “sign-off? and submit the
document into Change Control. The agreed document will then be published for use.

5.1.5 If the DSS, POCL and Horizon reviewers believe that the Specification is incomplete
or inadequate they will complete quality comment sheets spelling out the deficiencies,
the reasons for the comments and, if possible, suggested changes. The reviewer's
responses are channelled through the Acceptance Test Manager and passed back to
ICL Pathway in a consolidated format

5.1.6 ICL Pathway then analyse the consolidated comments. ICL Pathway can then accept
the comments and make appropriate changes or respond to the reviewers comments,
explaining reasons for rejecting the comments. At the same time, ICL Pathway will
produce and issue a revised version of the Acceptance Specification and an updated
consolidated review sheet indicating their responses. The ATM will then distribute
the new version and review sheet.

5.1.7. The review process is usually conducted in two cycles before ICL Pathway issue the
final version of the Acceptance Specification for approval by the Authorities and entry
into the Change Control process.

5.1.8 I The process for agreeing these Acceptance Specifications is based on the standard
Horizon Quality Review Process [Reference 13].

5.1.9 Products in this stage include:
. Acceptance Specifications which are agreed by both ICL Pathway and the
Sponsor or Sponsors and ready for submission into Change Control for “sign-

off’ and use in Acceptance Testing.

. agreed supporting Acceptance documents under ICL Pathway configuration
management (High Level Test Plans, Low Level Test Scripts, SADD etc.)

. Agreed Acceptance Criteria

RESTRICTED COMMERCIAL

PWY REF: BP/PLA/016
5.1.10 This stage has the following external dependencies:

. timely preparation and completion of Acceptance Specifications and supporting
documents by ICL Pathway;

. competent, timely and comprehensive staged reviews of Acceptance
Specifications by DSS and POCL reviewers;

. timely preparation of acceptable supporting documentation (HLTPs, BTs etc.)
under configuration control for the Acceptance Tests by ICL Pathway;

5.2. Acceptance Specifications in Dispute

5.2.1. Some Acceptance Specifications have not been completely agreed and signed-off by
the agreed start date for Acceptance Tests in mid October 1998. Faced with the delay
in obtaining agreement to the Specifications, the contracting Authorities have
indicated that they would be willing to agree to ICL Pathway commencing
Acceptance Testing without approval of the relevant Acceptance Specification or
Specifications. As part of that agreement, ICL Pathway would consider including any
additional Acceptance Tests identified after the start date within a subsequent stage of
regression testing or fitting outstanding Acceptance Tests as part of Acceptance
Reviews.

5.2.2 At a meeting between the Horizon Acceptance Manager and ICL Pathway
Acceptance Manager on 2 September 98, it was agreed that, wherever possible, the
Acceptance Tests should be conducted against complete and signed-off Acceptance
Specifications. Failing that, the Acceptance Tests and Reviews should be conducted
against caveated Acceptance Specifications and the test results include the
requirement for retesting against any missing, deficient or disputed Acceptance
Criteria.

5.2.3. The procedure for dealing with those issues and Acceptance Criteria omitted from the
caveated Acceptance Specifications will be:

. ICL Pathway to continue to accept comments from the ongoing review of
Acceptance Specifications. But this is not a “licence” for Horizon or its
Sponsors to reopen those Acceptance Specifications which have been “agreed”
or “published for approval”.

. ICL Pathway will add additional criteria to the Acceptance Specifications and
map to HLTPs where appropriate tests exist.

. If tests do no exist, ICL Pathway will suggest alternative means for Sponsors to
gain the necessary evidence - possibly through Acceptance Reviews.

. In the event that no appropriate existing Acceptance Trial or Review is
available then ICL Pathway will create a test which can be executed during the
Business Integration Test (BIT) regression phase, following completion of the
MOT but before commencement of the Live Trial. It should be noted that the
extensions to BIT may not be accomplished before the start of Live Trial;

. It may also be possible to run deferred tests in the later Steps.

RESTRICTED COMMERCIAL

PWY REF: BP/PLA/016
5.3. Review for Completeness

5.3.1. The Acceptance process consists of detailed analysis which, when amalgamated, will
allow the sponsors to form an overall view of proposed Acceptance Tests. The
Acceptance Database [Reference 18] will be the main tool to check the completeness
of the proposed tests, using full set of agreed Acceptance Specifications in order to
identify gaps.

5.3.2. Work is in progress, under Reference 10 and follow-on gap analysis, to identify gaps
through the gap analysis, but only when all of the Acceptance Specifications have
reached maturity may suspected omissions be confirmed. Horizon are maintaining an
ongoing dialogue with ICL Pathway throughout the preparation stage in order to
minimise the number of gaps which may be identified late. However, some issues will
only be confirmed towards the end of the Acceptance preparation stage, and others
may be revealed as the Acceptance process is under way.

5.4. Acceptance Specification Sign-off

5.4.1 Once each of the Acceptance Specifications are approved by all three parties, the
comments will be consolidated at Horizon and then reported up the DSS and POCL
Acceptance hierarchy, with a recommendation to submit to Change Control for “sign-
off” for each of the 23 specifications.

5.4.2 Products in this stage include:

. Signed off Acceptance Specifications.

5.5. Acceptance Planning
5.5.1 This stage involves:

. the establishment of the Horizon Acceptance Team, including the Acceptance
Test Managers;

. the preparation of this document, the overall Acceptance Stage Plan;

. drafting of Stage Plans and other documents for the remaining Acceptance
processes, including Acceptance Incident Management;

. development of the Horizon Acceptance organisation including Terms of
Reference for the Horizon Acceptance Boards and Job Descriptions for all of
the main Acceptance roles;

. development of a Horizon and BA body dealing with Acceptance issues of
mutual interest;

. the development of the Horizon organisation to include all Horizon related
Acceptance activities;

. development of the Horizon Acceptance management tools, including

. Horizon Acceptance Database;

. Horizon Acceptance Forms;

. Horizon Acceptance Files for subsequent audit purposes.
5.5.2 Products of this stage are:

. Complete and Approved Horizon Stage Plan for the Management of
Acceptance [this document];

. Horizon Acceptance Management Organisation [Reference 14].

5.6. Development of Acceptance Management Tools

5.6.1 The Horizon Acceptance Team will develop the following Acceptance Management
Tools:

. The Horizon Acceptance Management Plan (this document);

. A set of subordinate plans and procedures to cover all three phases of
Acceptance;

. The Horizon Acceptance Database (using both Access 2 and Access 95
applications) outlined in Reference 18;

. An Acceptance Incident element of the Horizon Acceptance Database also
outlined at Reference 18;

. The Horizon Acceptance Database, described at Reference 18.
5.6.2 Products of this stage are:

. Terms of Reference for all Horizon Acceptance Management bodies [Reference
14];

. Horizon Acceptance Database [Reference 18];

. Horizon Issues Database[Reference 18].

5.7. Resourcing for Acceptance

5.7.1 This stage requires the Horizon Acceptance Team, together with the BA Acceptance
Manager and contacts in the POCL Business and Technical Assurance groups to
identify the resources required to carry out the witnessing of Acceptance Trials and
Reviews, whose principles are discussed at Reference 15. Since the resources
available are known to be limited, there may a need to prioritise the Acceptance Trials
in order to target those offering greatest benefit to the Acceptance effort.

5.7.2 The priorities for witnessing and the co-ordinated resourcing of the witnessing tasks
will be managed by the Horizon Acceptance Management Team on behalf of the
Acceptance Management Forum.

5.7.3. This stage has the following external dependencies:

PWY REF: BP/PLA/016
. Adequate supplies of staff with appropriate technical and/or business skills from
Horizon and its Sponsors;

. Timely provision of the ICL Pathway detailed timetable for conducting
Acceptance Tests.

5.7.4 Products of this stage are:

. Confirmed resources for the conduct of all Horizon Acceptance Trials and
Reviews

. Working timetable for the witnessing of Trials and Reviews.

5.8. DSS Work Package Drafting

5.8.1 This stage requires Work Packages to be drafted in the DSS standard for DSS
approval for all Horizon Acceptance work on behalf of the DSS.

5.8.2 Products of this stage are a set of completed and accepted DSS Work packages.

5.9. Model Office Test and End to End Interface - Acceptance Criteria

5.9.1 Responsibility for Acceptance Test for the MOT and E2E Interface lies not with ICL
Pathway, but with Horizon. This includes the need for clear definition of Test
Conditions and Acceptance Criteria, including entry and exit criteria for the MOT.

5.9.2. MOT and E2E Interface do not involve the use of a contractually controlled
Acceptance Specification. Acceptance Incident reports may still be raised during
MOT and E2E, but they will not include a reference to an Acceptance Specification.

6. PHASE 2 - ACCEPTANCE TESTING

6.1. Introduction

6.1.1 This main execution phase will consist of a number of Acceptance Tests, documented
in the Acceptance Specifications, which can consist of Acceptance Trials or
Acceptance Reviews or in some cases a combination of the two. In general the
Acceptance of Services will be by Acceptance Trial and the Acceptance of
Deliverables will be by Acceptance Review. Details of the Horizon process for the
handling of Acceptance Trials is given at Reference 16. The conduct of Acceptance
Reviews is detailed at Reference 24.

6.1.2. The underlying principle is that Acceptance Testing (performing Acceptance Trials
and Acceptance Reviews) happens only once unless an Acceptance Incident occurs
that requires a change and retest.

6.1.3. All Acceptance Trials or Acceptance Reviews undertaken in collaboration with ICL
Pathway will be listed in one of the agreed Acceptance Specifications or will be part
of a subsequently agreed change to an Acceptance Specification.

6.1.4 The outcome of an Acceptance Trial or Review is either a pass or a fail (a deficiency);

att00002.dat Page 7 of 48 12/01/99
POL00029137
POL00029137

RESTRICTED COMMERCIAL

PWY REF: BP/PLA/016
the definitions of which take into account the severity of Acceptance Incidents which
have occurred during the Trial or Review. If no Acceptance Incidents are raised to
record deficiencies, then the Service or Deliverable will be deemed to have been
accepted. The outcomes of these events need to be carefully recorded on the
Acceptance Database by the Horizon Acceptance Support Team.

6.1.5 In the case of the MOT, where there is no ICL Pathway Acceptance Specification,
Acceptance Incident Reports may be raised in the event of any incident occurring
during the test which identifies a failure to meet any obligation under the Authorities’
Agreements.

6.1.6 More details on the processes for handling Acceptance Incidents are given at
Reference 17.

6.2. Acceptance and Release Authorisation

6.2.1. Whereas the Acceptance decision focuses on assessing whether the ICL Pathway
delivered services meet the contracted obligations, Release Authorisation takes a
broader view to assess the business viability of the delivered services. The key
question for Release Authorisation is whether to proceed with the implementation of
releases into the BA/POCL service environment (i.e. including appropriate POCL or
DSS system releases). The decision to authorise the release of services into the
defined environment requires a consideration to be given to the readiness of all parties
to act as both supplier and customer in supporting and implementing these services in
the prescribed environment.

6.2.2 It should be understood that although DSS retains joint responsibility for making the
Release Authorisation decision with POCL, the Horizon Programme PID identifies
the Horizon programme as having the responsibility for managing the Release
Authorisation process. The procedures for Release Authorisation are detailed at
Reference 25.

6.2.3 In this context it is envisaged that the Acceptance and Release Authorisation processes
will be run in parallel and that although the basis for decision-making within each

stream may utilise much common evidence, the two processes need to remain separate,
coming together at specific points to influence decision making.

7. ACCEPTANCE TEST TASKS

TA, Acceptance Trials

7.1.1 As defined in the Authority Schedules, an Acceptance Trial consists of one or more of
the following:

. inspection of any system used to provide a Service;
. demonstration of any system used to provide a Service;

. running a real or simulated operational workload on any system used to provide
a Service;

att00002.dat Page 8 of 48 12/01/99
POL00029137
POL00029137

RESTRICTED COMMERCIAL

PWY REF: BP/PLA/016
. monitoring provision of a Service over a trial period to verify performance to
the Service Levels specified for the Service.

7.1.2 The scope and conduct of any Acceptance Trial is documented in the Acceptance
Specification. It is contractually agreed that an Acceptance Trial may not commence
until the Acceptance Specification has been approved by the Authority. However, in
the case of caveated Acceptance Specifications, testing will be carried out against the
agreed parts of the Specification.

7.1.3 Acceptance Trials can take many formats. The majority of them will be walk-
throughs of the service and deliverables under examination type conditions, from a
test not necessarily designed to satisfy a single Acceptance Specification and usually
conducted on ICL Pathway premises. Those Trials may be witnessed as desired by
Horizon and its Sponsors. Any other type of activity during Trials can be linked to an
Acceptance Criteria if it in some way provides assurance to Horizon and its Sponsors.

7.1.4 The Horizon and Sponsor observers of Acceptance Trials are referred to as
"witnesses".

7.2. Acceptance Reviews
7.2.1 An Acceptance Review consist of one or more of the following:

. inspection of a Deliverable (e.g. a document) by one or more competent
reviewers nominated by the Authority;

. inspection by one or more competent reviewers nominated by the Authority of
documentary evidence that a Service has been provided;

. a meeting between the Authority and ICL Pathway at which one or more of the
following occur:

. Deliverables or documentary evidence are inspected;
. a presentation is given by ICL Pathway;

. the results of prior inspections, visits or presentations are reviewed and
the outcome agreed;

. a demonstration of a Service or Deliverable.

7.2.2. The scope and conduct of any Acceptance Review proposed shall be documented in
an Acceptance Specification, and the Acceptance Review shall not commence until
the Acceptance Specification has been approved by the Authority.

7.2.3. The process for the conduct of Acceptance Reviews is detailed at Reference 24.
Acceptance Reviews of Deliverables will use the standard Horizon Quality Review
process where this is relevant e.g. for a document review.

7.2.4 The Horizon, POCL and DSS personnel conducting Acceptance Reviews are also
referred to as "witnesses".

7.3. Acceptance Incident Management

7.3.1. An Acceptance Incident is any unusual or undesirable occurrence, or any request for
advice and guidance, which has been raised in writing, using the procedures set out in
Reference 17, by Horizon, DSS or POCL witnesses to ICL Pathway in respect of an
Acceptance Trial or Review. Acceptance Incidents may be raised by Acceptance Test
Managers, by Horizon and Sponsor witnesses of Acceptance Trials or Reviews, or by
ICL Pathway staff associated with Acceptance, by Horizon Service Management staff
or others, such as Model Office testers.

7.3.2. Details of the Acceptance Incident Management process and procedures are given at
Horizon Process for Handling Acceptance Incidents [Reference 17].

8. PHASE 3 - CONTRACTUAL ACCEPTANCE

8.0.1 Contractually the Joint Acceptance Board (which reports to the Boards of DSS and
POCL) must confirm Acceptance of the Operational Trial to ICL Pathway within five
working days of the end of the Acceptance Period (the end of Live Trial). [Details of
this process and the management bodies involved, are still under review by the
Acceptance Management Forum. When clarified, this section will be enlarged to
reflect the agreed processes.

8.0.2. The process to be used in this third phase of the plan has still to be designed based on
the principles set out in Reference 12. But essentially the phase is to enable the Joint
Acceptance Board to make an informed decision as whether to formally accept the
ICL Pathway Service and Products. The Horizon Acceptance Manager will produce
a management summary for the Joint Acceptance Board which is extracted from the
acceptance reports produced by each Acceptance Test Manager with the assistance of
the Horizon Acceptance Team. Details of the impact assessment for any outstanding
Acceptance Incidents will also be included in the management summary.

8.0.3. The Joint Acceptance Board will consider the Acceptance recommendations made to
them and taking into account any other matters known by them, will make
appropriate recommendations to the DSS CAPS& Cards Programme Board and the
POCL Chief Executives’ Committee. Those recommendations are likely to be either
rejection, acceptance or partial acceptance of the ICL Pathway Services and Products.
The decision of the two Sponsor Boards will then be passed to the Release
Authorisation Board.

8.0.4 In this context, partial acceptance means where ICL Pathway have failed to meet the
criteria for contractual Acceptance but that a negotiated route to the achievement of
full service and contractual remedies can be agreed between the Authorities and ICL
Pathway.

9.1.2 An outline of the Horizon Acceptance management organisation is given below.

9.2. Horizon Acceptance Manager

9.2.1. The Horizon Product Assurance Manager has the additional role of the Horizon
Acceptance Manager. His task is to oversee the planning, co-ordination and
facilitation of the Horizon Acceptance Process and ensure that all the business
requirements in the Related Agreements are fully covered in a complete and
comprehensive way. In addition he is charged with regular liaison with his fellow
Acceptance Managers at the DSS and ICL Pathway. He is a member of several of the
Horizon Acceptance boards. His duties are detailed at Horizon Acceptance
Management Organisation [Reference 14].

9.3. Horizon Acceptance Team

9.3.1 Horizon have established a small Acceptance Team within the Product Assurance
Group to support the management of the Acceptance process. Under the Horizon
Acceptance Team Leader, the Horizon Acceptance Team includes the Acceptance
Incident Manager, the Acceptance Process Manager and Acceptance Process support
staff. More details of the roles and responsibilities of these staff are provided at

9.4, Acceptance Test Managers

9.4.1. Horizon has appointed Acceptance Test Managers for each Acceptance Test. They
are usually the former “document champion” for the respective Acceptance
Specification. More information is at Roles and Tasks of the Horizon Acceptance
Test Managers [Reference 12].

9.5. Impact Analyst(s)

9.5.1 The Impact Analyst(s) is/are responsible for carrying out an Impact Analysis on a
specific Acceptance Incident where ICL Pathway claims that the Acceptance Incident
cannot be resolved.

9.5.2 There may be several Impact Analysts, and they may work on one or more
Acceptance Incidents. An Acceptance Incident may require Impact Analysts from
one or both of the Sponsor(s), from Horizon, or from ICL Pathway.

10. HORIZON ACCEPTANCE - RELATIONS WITH SPONSORS

10.1. Relationships Between Horizon and DSS

10.1.1 It has been agreed that Horizon will hold Acceptance co-ordination meetings with the
DSS, especially the BA COBAPS staff, on a regular basis, possibly as a precursor to
the tripartite meetings of the Acceptance Management Forum.

10.1.2 In addition the Acceptance Test Managers have established but informal networks
used in the review of Acceptance Specifications and other documents. These will
become firmer during the witnessing of Acceptance Trials.

10.2. Relationships between Horizon and POCL

10.2.1. Horizon co-ordination with POCL occurs both formally and informally at several
levels from that of the Programme Director, Horizon with the POCL Chief
Executive’s Committee to similar links at lower levels.

1. HORIZON ACCEPTANCE MANAGEMENT FORUMS

11.1.1 Horizon Acceptance Management requires the establishment of three forums whose
roles and responsibilities are shown in outline at Figure 5 above and are detailed at
Horizon Acceptance Management Organisation [Reference 14]. That document
covers the following:

. Acceptance Incident Review Panel (IRP), responsible for day-day management
and resolution of Acceptance Incidents. Meeting formally on a weekly basis to
confirm decision and priority reports and to otherwise review progress and to
develop reports to the next level, the Acceptance Management Forum. The
IRP will begin its meetings as soon as Acceptance Testing begins.

The Acceptance Management Forum (AMF) which is tasked with the co-
ordinated management between POCL, ICL Pathway and the DSS of the
Acceptance process within the agreed programme milestones and to resolve any
issues escalated to it. It will formally meet at least formally on a fortnightly
basis. Any Acceptance Incidents which are not resolved at the Forum are to be
escalated to the Joint Acceptance Board, part of the Horizon Delivery Group.
The AMF began its work at the first tripartite meeting on 1 October 1998.

The Joint Acceptance Board (JAB), which is tasked with formal confirmation of
the three steps of Acceptance during the Operational Trial. The Board is the
final arbiter in the case of Acceptance Incidents and other programme issues
which are referred to it.

provision of a basis for gap analysis; support for the work of
Acceptance Test Managers during Acceptance Trials and
Reviews in identifying the impact of test failures or Acceptance
Incidents on the objectives of Horizon and its Sponsors;
provision of the means of recording the Acceptance Incident
management process. [Reference 18]

Acceptance Any unusual or undesirable occurrence, or request for advice
Incident and guidance, which is reported in writing by Horizon to ICL
Pathway during an Acceptance Test. An Acceptance Incident
can be either where an Acceptance Criterion is not met; where
there is a substantive fault; or in other circumstances.
[References 1,9 and 17]

Acceptance Issue I A problem occurring during the three phases of Acceptance or
the aftermath of an event in any aspect of the Acceptance
process, which critically threatens to damage, hinder or stop the
Acceptance process or to affect the time or other resources
allocated to Acceptance. In general, Acceptance Issues are
referred to and managed by the Acceptance Management
Forum. [References 14 and 19]

Acceptance Joint Acceptance Board is contractually required to confirm

Acceptance of the Operational Trial to ICL Pathway within five
working days of the end of the Acceptance Period. [Reference
9]

Deliverable

An item which ICL Pathway is required to provide under the
terms of the Related Agreements.

Direct Interface

Tests to ensure that each of the system interfaces conform to the

Test (DIT) Application and Technical Interface Specification and support
the business, technical and security requirements of both parties
on either end of the interface. [Reference 8]

End to End Testing to ensure that the full end to end business processes,

Interface Test within the BA/POCL scope, are satisfied by each of the systems

(E2E) involved, whether existing or new. [Reference 8]

Failed The outcome of an Acceptance Test where one or more high or

Acceptance medium severity deficiencies remain unresolved at the end of the
Acceptance Period.

High Level Test I Documents developed by ICL Pathway against the requirements

Plan (HLTP) of the Acceptance Test Specifications. The HLTP cover each of

the stages of testing, detailing the specific scope, coverage,
objectives and success criteria that apply. In this high level test
planning stage, the test objectives have been formally
documented and agreed by both Horizon and by ICL Pathway,
and combined to form a joint set of test objectives which serve
to drive all subsequent testing activity.

Low Level Test

A detailed test script developed by ICL Pathway from the HLTP

Script (LLTS) and the BT which details the actions to be carried out during
each Test. [This document.]

Live Trial The third and last phase of the Operational Trial

Model Office Test I The second phase of each Step of Acceptance; and a further test

(MOT) of the Pathway system to provide evidence as to whether the

contracted obligations to both parties have been met. It uses
simulated data and as near lifelike arrangements in a production
like environment using actual. Tests are conducted to ensure the
system and manual business processes interact through the use
of training and procedures to meet the overall business needs of
the BA/POCL programme. [This paper]

Operational Trial

A process for assessing the functionality and performance of the
Services and the Service Infrastructure prior to National
Rollout. Each Step of the Operational Trial has three phases:
Technical Test, Model Office Test and Live Trial. Contractual
Acceptance is linked to the completion and outcomes of this
trial.

Agreements Agreement.
Service This document provides the design of the service architecture in
Architecture accordance with Clause 401.1 of the Authorities’ Agreement,
Design Document I and Requirements 928 and 951.
(SADD)
The purpose of the SADD is to describe the design of the
service architecture (R951). It must as a minimum specify:
The major components used in providing the services;
The functionality within major components;
The interfaces between components and with Authorities’ and
other parties’ systems;
The service levels required across interfaces. [Reference 6]
Services All the Services to be performed by, and all other obligations of,

ICL Pathway under the Related Agreements.

Security Test

Tests conducted to ensure that the ICL Pathway solution meets
the security requirements of the BA/POCL programme. Some
of these tests will be achieved through tests conducted in other
phases. [Reference 8]

System Test

The testing to ensure that the ICL Pathway solution functionally
conforms to the requirements of the BA/POCL programme. In
addition, these tests will ensure that the Human Computer
Interface for the combined products meet the HCI requirements.
[Reference 8]

Technical Test

The first phase of the Operational Trial to ensure that the ICL
Pathway solution meets the performance, volume, resilience and
operability requirements of the BA/POCL programme.

Witnessing

The observation by staff from Horizon, the DSS and POCL of
Acceptance Trials carried out by ICL Pathway to provide an
opinion on the reliability and sufficiency of information
contained in the Pathway Acceptance Test Closure Reports and
to assess the ICL Pathway management of those tests. Witnesses
should have either technical or business expertise relevant to the
tests or have experience in the technical audit of complex system
tests. Witnessing may be process and/or criteria related. Process
witnessing entails examination of aspects of management control
over the testing process as applied to Acceptance Trials. Criteria
witnessing involves verification of the output of particular
service or product operating successfully within the Acceptance
Test environment. Both aspects of witnessing may be applied
whilst Acceptance Testing is underway by means of observation.
Similarly both aspects may be applied retrospectively by
examining the supporting documentation e.g. Test Results, ICL
Pathway Closure Reports and PinICLs and Acceptance Incident
reports raised during the Trial.

ANNEX C - NOTES ON TESTING
System Test Streams
1. System Testing is an ICL Pathway managed set of tests which covers the following

Pathway systems:

Automated Payment Service (APS);
Electronic Point of Sale Service (EPOSS);

Benefit Payment Service (BPS) which covers Automated Payment Service,
Card Management System Payment Authorisation Service;

Order Book Control Service (OBCS);
Transaction Processing System (TPS);
Management Information System (MIS);
Training;

Audit.

Integration Test Streams

2. Integration Test covers a wide range of complementary test streams. The test streams
where Acceptance Testing will be carried out are:

DIT - Direct Interface Test;

T&S - Technical & Security Test (including Security Test; Performance Test;
Integrity Test and Systems Management Test);

BIT - Business Integration Test;
E2E - End to End Interface Test;

MOR - Model Office Rehearsal.

3. The phased approach to test execution is the “3 pass model’ formalised for Release

NR2:

Ist Pass - stabilise;
Main Pass - iterative defect removal;

Final Pass - audit trail, which then pass used for Acceptance Trials.

E2E and MOR
4. MOR is an integral part of Integration Test which prepares the way for Model Office

Test. MOR involves Joint Business Test Team, and Horizon testing (including POCL
counter staff) play a major role in it, but it must be emphasised that MOR remains a
Pathway test activity with specific Pathway test objectives.

5. The aims of E2E and MOR test streams are to bring the IT system together with the
business procedures, to trial the training activities and to deploy the target live
support channels, running all the contributing systems in unison and exercising all
major end to end business flows. In effect to trial the overall business system.

6. The Ist and Main passes of both E2E and MOR are recognised as Pathway owned
test phases, an integral part of the Integration Test stage, operating within the Joint
Testing agreement. MOT remains an independently owned PDA test stage. The
Final Pass of E2E is proposed likewise to be an independently owned PDA test stage.
The start of E2E Final Pass should be aligned with that of MOT to facilitate baseline

control.
Live Trial
7. Live Trial is a stage of testing, and that there are certain aspects of the service which

it will not be possible to demonstrate prior to actual live operation. Hence the
contractual acceptance of the service cannot be concluded until the Live Trial has
been completed.

BIT Maintenance and Regression Testing

8. With the completion of BIT, ICL pathway will switch to a continuous programme of
BIT regression testing to sustain fault rectification and system software modifications.
The regression tests may be used for delayed Acceptance Trials.

Test Programme
9. The sequence of test passes which involve Acceptance is detailed at Annex B.
Joint Testing

10. Joint Testing is a set of activities which input to ICL Pathway and will operate under
the direction of ICL Pathway and will not, therefore, have any assurance aspect such
as Acceptance. It is possible that the joint testing resource may have involvement in
Acceptance Testing on behalf of either ICL Pathway or the Horizon.

1. In Joint Testing, Horizon resources will be deployed to work with ICL Pathway,
within this agreement, on System Test, BIT, DIT, End to End (E2E), Security and
Technical testing streams. The work on E2E is separate from the Horizon activities
on E2E and Model Office Test (documented in the Nile Release 2 End to End
Interface Model Office Testing Approach). The resource will operate within two
Horizon teams, the Joint Business Test Team at Feltham, and the Joint Technical Test
Team at Bracknell.

12. The Joint Business Test Team will provide resource to work with ICL Pathway on

System Test and BIT. In addition, a DSS and a POCL resource will work with ICL
Pathway to support DIT and E2E tests, in particular to aid ICL Pathway with analysis
on data reconciliation and accounting.

13. The Joint Technical Test team is a Horizon team which works with The Solution
Centre, Bracknell, on ICL Pathway’s Security and Technical testing.
