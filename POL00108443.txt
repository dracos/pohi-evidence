Mark — please see below from Fujitsu.

Insofar as the first point is concerned re: interface specification, can I suggest you speak to Dave King to see whether
he/we have the material you require (Dave, Julie — please shout if that’s not the way to go).

As for the second point re: transaction data integrity, I have spoken to Belinda this morning and we think the best
approach is still as we discussed before the Easter break, ie. you set out in writing the “exam question” you want
answered and why. If that doesn’t satisfy Fujitsu (and it’s not for them to tell us what we want or why), it will inform
any meeting we need to have with them to advance matters.

Have you been able to speak to Gareth about drafting the “exam question”, and if so, what are your thoughts?

Kind regards, Rodric

Rodric,

Following last weeks conversations on the review of 3 party systems interfaces, in particular, DVLA, I have discussed
with the architects and the interface specification that provides the architecture and details of the relevant controls is a
Post Office owned architecture artefact so should be available to your teams already. I think this will give you what you
need. If you are having problems tracking down, please advise and we can help.

With regards the linkage of proving integrity of horizon transaction data / records to a review of 3" party systems
{ultimately to challenge second sight assertions), I think it would make sense if we have a session to explore this with
our respective teams as we seem to be diverging in our views on the key areas to focus on when addressing this central
question.

Happy to discuss further.

Regards,

James Davidson

James,

Can you try to send the second attachment to Dave King, POL Security Architect (cc’ed}? He is one of Julie George’s
senior managers and is best placed to receive a large file.

Please let me know whether or not you are successful in sending it to Dave.
Dave — assuming James’ email does get through to you, please give me a call so we can agree next steps.

Kind regards, Rodric
