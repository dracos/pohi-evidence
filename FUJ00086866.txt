Subject: RE: CS Requirements (SSC) Solution Compliance Review - Meeting 29/10/08 Action 36 (CS-BR-825)
Simon,

No.

The agreed wording from the meeting - "A lightweight process to introduce new applications to the installed base on the SAS servers.
This should not require a CP and be achievable within a week."

Has been converted to "Installation of new SSC diagnostic applications requiring an install on the SAS server (e.g. .msi file or setup.exe) would
need to follow due process." leaving it open, at any time, for someone to claim that the CP process is the "due process" - this is precisely
what we are trying to avoid. We have argued the case, and have achieved agreement in meetings, why is it proving so difficult to word
the compliance statement to the equivalent of what has already been agreed ?

You can do one of two things .Either use the wording which has already been agreed in the meeting as above OR change the wording
of the second paragraph to the following "SSC scripts , bespoke diagnostic code and new SSC diagnostic applications requiring an install on

the SAS server can be uploaded to the SSC area on the SAS servers using FTP or SSH session, subject to CS operational procedures. Such
updates would be lost in the event of the SAS server being rebuilt. "

Thanks for your feedback. The compliance text has now been revised and is given below for your approval

Remote desktop server shall be provided on
SSC Servers.

Note: remote desktops on SSC Servers to be
provided to mitigate against data loss
through network malfunctions.

The SSC perform a lot of data processing
tasks on an ad hoc basis that is sensitive to
interruption. By providing the remote desktop
server on the SSC platform we can mitigate
against data loss by ensuring that tasks are
managed locally and not through another
client connection.

RDP, SSH & FTP access from the SSC Workstations HNG-X VM will be
permitted to the SSC servers directly. Further access is provided to the
SSC servers via RDP through the SAS Secure Access Servers (SSN
Platform) giving SQL Client, Perfmon, Events, JDBC & http(s) access as
well as the SSH & FTP access. The RDP route through the SAS also gives
access to other systems.

SSC scripts and bespoke diagnostic code can be uploaded to the SSC
area on the SAS servers using FTP or SSH session, subject to CS
operational procedures. Such updates would be lost in the event of the
SAS server being rebuilt. Installation of new SSC diagnostic applications
requiring an install on the SAS server (e.g. .msi file or setup.exe) would
need to follow due process.

Simon,
OK as far as it goes, but is does not capture all that was agreed at the meeting attended by Steve Parker on this subject.

Following wording copied from original AGREED minutes of the meeting:

To archive this we need:

3) A lightweight process and systems to add scripts and other bespoke code to the SAS servers.
In order to be usable this needs to be a direct transfer mechanism so that scripts can be added

to the SAS server within a few minutes.

4) A lightweight process to introduce new applications to the installed base on the SAS servers.
This should not require a CP and be achievable within a week.

Without this, the new process whereby all tools are on the SAS WILL NOT WORK. Therefore this part is essential, has been
agreed, and must be included

Regards
Mik

I thought that the attached compliance was what was agreed with Jim Sweeting.

Steve Parker can discuss this with Shahid Latif, who still does the design for SSN.

I’m also happy to discuss.

Shahid - can you get to the bottom of what Steve wants and we'll go from there - thanks

The compliance text we put together for CS-BR-825 was questioned by the SSC and the feedback in the meeting was that the

example I was giving related to the Out of Hour laptop connection rather than a

connection from an SSC office workstation.

The action we took was to identify someone within SAS/SSN Architecture & Design to discuss the compliance position with the

SSC (their contact being Steve Parker).

Could you let me know who that would be ? Would this be you? someone else?

Remote access to SSC servers will be
permitted but must be via the SAS Secure

e.g. On Corporate FJS LAN using Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) to SAS (SSN) over
Secure Socket Layer (SSL), and then on the
RMGA Campus using Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP) from SAS (SSN to the SSC
server).
