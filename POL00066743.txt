we' re waiting for the computer, which is particularly slow, and she will go home and I'll finish it off.

(TC: 00:13:20)
Robert Daley: Okay. So, what, what does-, what does typically Doreen do?

(TC: 00:13:25)
Peter Holmes: Um, everything until we get to the point where there's only the paperwork to be printed by
the computer. All the forms, all the reports are, are done between us.

(TC: 00:13:35)
Robert Daley: So, who would declare the cash?

(TC: 00:13:38)

Robert Daley: And what about the rest and all the bits of paper, err, weekly reports etc, who does
that?

(TC: 00:14:05)

and eventually it prints the reports.

slow.

(TC: 00:14:45)

Robert Daley: You say bulk. How much is normally kept in there?

(TC: 00:18:38)
Peter Holmes: Um, we would keep 3000 in twenties, well, split between the three positions, you get one
bundle of twenties, one bundle of tens, and then we split two bundles of fives between us.

(TC: 00:18:51)
Robert Daley: Right.

(TC: 00:18:52)
Peter Holmes: Over the three positions. And any spare would be left in the back.

(TC: 00:19:13)
Robert Daley: So, keys to the Post Office and, err, the safe, where are they kept?

(TC: 00:19:18)

Peter Holmes: Right, they're kept in the chemist's, hung up on a hook on the dispensing chemist’ s
counter. I put them there at half past five or when we get the office shut, maybe it's five minutes after that.
And I don’t see them again until the next morning when I come in at half past eight

(TC: 00:19:41)
Robert Daley: The safes themself, do safes have time locks on them?

(TC: 00:19:44)
Peter Holmes: Err, they don't-, they do have a time lock on them yes but they don’t have a separate
section inside with the extra 40 minutes.

(TC: 00:19:50)

(TC: 00:19:52)

Robert Daley: What Wednesday?

(TC: 00:20:46)
Peter Holmes: I put the keys on the hook. That was the Wednesday before the auditors arrived on the

(TC: 00:20:52)
Robert Daley: (talking over each other 20.52) Yeah.

(TC: 00:20:56)

Peter Holmes: I put the keys on the hook as, as is normal practice. When I came in the next morning the
three auditors were with us, and Sunil, and he handed me the two safe keys and he took the office keys
out of his pocket. I don’t know why. I'm saying nothing, you know, I'm, I' m not trying to accuse the guy,
but that’s just the situation on that Thursday morning when the three auditors were there. He give me the
two safe keys separately and took the office keys out of his pocket. I wouldn’t mind knowing if anybody
has been into that safe in an evening after I’ve locked it.

(TC: 00:21:37)

(TC: 00:26:16)
Robert Daley: Okay. Why is there two cash declarations then?

(TC: 00:26:19)

(TC: 00:27:38)

he doesn't like me, I'm not very keen on him. But he has no idea in man management, and he would just

Peter Holmes: Yeah.

(TC: 00:33:58)
Robert Daley: But down here you've got an overage of £62,280.80. But then when it says
adjustments, you've scored that out and put £300. Do you know what that's about?

(TC: 00:34:11)
Peter Holmes: Going back two years?

(TC: 00:34:12)
Robert Daley: Well, year. One year.

(TC: 00:34:27)
Peter Holmes: I honestly can't remember about that.

(TC: 00:34:30)

same financial year, 2008-, 2007/2008. Err, it's from the 22/08/2007 to 19/09/2007. Cash in hand

(TC: 00:35:13)
Robert Daley: Would that be an approximate amount in the office?

(TC: 00:35:20)
Peter Holmes: Um, if we could look at next week's and see what I sent back.

(TC: 00:35:24)
Robert Daley: Err, we don't have-, well, we have what happens, these are just the branch trading

(TC: 00:36:12)
Robert Daley: Now, that's went up £15,000, the cash in hand figure, over that period.

(TC: 00:36:19)
Peter Holmes: Yeah, from week to week I' m not surprised. Sometimes you get a lot of giro bank
customers coming in. Sometimes (talking over each other 36.24).

(TC: 00:36:23)
Robert Daley: No, this is-, this is the month. This is over a four week period.

(TC: 00:36:25)
Peter Holmes: Of, over a month?

(TC: 00:36:27)
Robert Daley: Yeah.

(TC: 00:36:28)

Peter Holmes: Well that, that could be. I mean we' ve got one or two customers who pay an awful lot of
money in. They only-, they don’t come into us regularly because they' re, from a security point of view,
they use two or three Post Offices. One in particular has paid me in the past 12,000 in one day, she's come
in the next day and paid another 13,000 in. And she's from a tanning studio, they've got about twelve of
them down in the Teesside area apparently.
