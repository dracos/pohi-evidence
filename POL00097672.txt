Simon
This is a general catch up on a number of issues:
1. I attach Spot Review SROO1.docx which is the John Armstrong case we discussed on the last call

2. The main issue in SROO1 is the automated and largely silent recovery process which occurs when Horizon detects
either a power or a communications failure. Can you ask Fujitsu to provide us with a clear written description,
including flowcharts, of how this is designed to operate for both old and new Horizon?

3. Tied in to the above, we would like to run some tests on a live Horizon terminal (possibly a training terminal)
when we execute various types of transaction and at the same time cut the power or the internet connection.
We will then observe and analyse the recovery process. It will be important that the terminal being used is a
close to a live system as is possible. I assume the training office terminal in your building will be the best place to
do this, however we will probably need to book this for a number of sessions. Will this be possible?

Many thanks. I look forward to seeing you on Thursday afternoon
With best wishes
