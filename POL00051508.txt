Dear Sir/Madam

Re: Regina vy Seema Misra, Guildford Crown Court Trial - W/L 1“ — 12" June
2009

I am the investigator in the case of Seema Misra, Subpostmistress of West Byfleet Post
Office This case involves theft and false accounting of £74K.

During interview, Mrs Misra alleged that some of the shortages were due to staff thefts
and that she reported this to the police. My defence barrister has asked me to clarify
whether any such report was made. After speaking to one of your operators today on
the West Surrey Crime Desk I was advised that there is a record of Mr Davinder Misra
(husband) reporting a theft by employee of £2,000. The Crime Related Reference is
D/067865.

I requested a copy of the crime report but the operator said that I would need to put
my request in writing to your department, hence this letter.

My application for this information is made under section 29(3) under the data
protection act 1998. This information is required for the purpose of the prevention and
detection of crime and/or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders. If I do not
receive this data it will prejudice the purpose specified above. I undertake to treat the
data supplied in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and to treat the data in
confidence.

Yours sincerely
