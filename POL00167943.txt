Subject: Potential meeting following your Board, and Parliamentary Recess dates FY!
Dear Alwen,

Thanks for a good meeting this morning, and terrific coffee.

Tam following up three points immediately: the potential meeting on 22 or 23 July, and Recess.

1. 22 / 23 July meeting
Tam away from.49_July.until.2 August, and so if we do not nail down a time before I go, the person
to contact is! iwho runs James’ diary ). However,

she is not here on 22 July. The diary is already filling, so would it be an idea to pencil something in
now, do you think?

2. Summer recess
House rises 18 July, resumes 2 September
During this period, James is generally not available at all.

Iam away from 19 July until 2 August — but I will be picking up emails, my colleagues will be picking up
phone messages.

3. Conference recess

House rises 13 September, resumes 8 October

These dates are simply for you to bear in mind at this stage. If we need meetings or scheduled phone
calls involving James, please book these as soon as their need becomes apparent via me. The diary is
absurdly full already, but he will make room for you wherever possible.

T hope this is helpful, and we will talk next week, I am sure.
Janet
