It is not clear from the report if actual money is taken, certainly in relation to the
large "deposits" from the Santander card this seems to be evidence of false
accounting. I'm not sure if in fact what the accused was doing was taking money
from the till (hence shortfall in the stock) and ATM or he was simply bumping up
the figures to make it look like he was trading (and therefore entitled to more?)
better than he was.

The report doesn't read very well, even as someone used to reading this.

I have asked for statements and the docuementary productions to be lodged by
12 March 15.

I sent an email to RO not containing personal data, as it is not clear that the
Post Office's email is secure (it's not CJSM Net or GSI)
