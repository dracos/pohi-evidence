All

We are on top of this. Mr McCormack regularly writes to us in unpleasant terms and unfortunately he also
posts very unpleasant blogs. All the matters of which he complains are the subject of review by the CCRC.

Subject: The Dalmellington Error in Horizon I problemswithpo

Dear both,
This needs looking into please.

https: //problemswithpol .wordpress.com/2015/11/10/the-error-in-horizon/?i frame=true&theme_preview=true

can I have a report that takes the points in order and explains them.
Tim McCormack is campaigning against PO and Horizon. I had another note from him this am which Tom will
forward, so you are both in the loop.

We must take him seriously and professionally.

This particular blog is independent of sparrow but clearly related in that it appears to present similar
challenges that were raised in the course of the scheme.

I'm most concerned that we/ our suppliers appear to be very lax at handling £24k. And want to know we've
rectified all the issues raised, if they happened as Tim explains.

Thanks.

Paula
