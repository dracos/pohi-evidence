PLANNING
Plan

Version 7.7 (draft) of the Horizon IPP has been received on 7/5/99. This will be
reviewed and comments fed back accordingly.

Work continues to detail the NR2+ plans but the finalisation of the plan is dependent on
ongoing discussions between ICL and POCL regarding joint working and the outcome of
the Treasury Review.

Handshake Milestones

At a meeting with the Horizon Project Office on 7 May, the issue of Handshake
milestones was discussed. The joint view is that the Handshake milestone process is not
functioning effectively and therefore not adding any value in its present form. Although
the process is conceptually correct, it is not delivering. The meeting agreed to review the
Handshake milestone process (once more) and propose a solution which would be fully
supported by both parties.

TECHNICAL & SECURITY TESTING

Progress with PinICL clearance and regression testing for Live Trial has continued and
the requisite level of confidence to enable us to go into the data centre migration has
been established. Across all technical test streams a total of 749 tests have been run with

only 8 failures.

The Performance Summary Report for NR2 has now been authorised at version 1.0 and
presented to the acceptance review body.

MULTI BENEFIT TESTING WITH CAPS

Testing concluded cycle 1 on 27/4/99. A number of the planned tests were abandoned
due to a data shortage from CAPS, this lead to only 67% DSS success/coverage and 75%
Horizon success/coverage.

CAPS now plan to take an updated live snap shot for the next cycle, this cycle should be
based on Live Reference data. Pathway will need to create a new start position to match
the re-mapped CAPS position.

CAPS 3.5 & ON-LINE ENQUIRES

3.5 regression against NR2 concluded last week and 3.5 to Rlc regression started 6/5/99.

DATA CENTRE MIGRATION
Data Centre Migration Rehearsal

A Data Centre migration rehearsal took place w/e 4/5/99. A number of problems were
identified and resolved to provide a firm foundation for the migration proper the
following weekend.

Data Centre Migration

Although a number of problems were encountered throughout the weekend, the
migration exercise was completed successfully with a qualified sign-off by CAPS at
01.55 am on 10/5/99. The qualification is based upon Pathway providing an explanation
of I outstanding issue with regard to stop files.

ACCEPTANCE PREPARATION & TESTING

Acceptance Specifications:

There remain two specifications requiring approval. That for BES is available for
approval. A CCN to make some Requirements double key to facilitate POCL approval is
with the Authorities. Horizon are taking other initiatives, which, if successful would
obviate the need for a contract change. That for Service Boundaries is in course of
revision by Pathway following a successful way-ahead meeting.

Acceptance Trials

Ten of the 11 Acceptance Trials Closure reports have been issued. Horizon have issued
a proposal to validate six, principally POCL, closure reports. This activity will start the
week ending 14/5. The four BPS and Audit closure reports were based on witnessed tests
and do not require further validation. The last, POCL Infrastructure, trials closure report
is forecast to be issued week ending 14/5.

The BIT regression run has completed and the results support the system’s readiness for
Live.

Acceptance Reviews

Of the 60 or so Review segments, packs have now been issued for around 50, and some
25 of the associated Acceptance Review Meetings held. PAS and Customer Education
have now completed their Reviews. The latest review proper is currently scheduled for
16/6. There are some demonstrations beyond that date that depend on Live Trial

running, the last currently scheduled for 7/7.

8.2.2 Live Trial Preparations (Existing 204 outlets)

Infrastructure
All modifications are now complete.

Installation

The number of outlets in the programme has reduced from 204 to 196. The following
outlets have been permanently closed as Post Offices :

West Duddo (trolley)
Blackhorse

Chatton

Greenway
Cambridge

The following outlets have been removed from the Live Trial and equipment has been
removed. These will be scheduled in at an appropriate time as part of NRO :

Cirencester Road
Hales Road
Thropton

8.2.3 Migration (Existing 204 outlets)

All of the current 196 Post Office outlets were migrated successfully from Release Ic to
NR2. The last two outlets completed in the morning of Friday 7/5/99.

8.2.3.1 Balancing of Accounts

The major concern continues to be the large number of outlets having problems with
balancing, which resulted in the Horizon System Help Desk being overwhelmed with
calls. Various measures are being put in place to provide additional capacity at the Help
Desk to be ready for 12/5/99.

All HFSOs are to attend a I day refresher course covering balancing.

Changes to User Training are being made, which include extending the Counter
Managers course by half a day. The extra time concentrates solely on balancing. The
extended course has been introduced in time for the training for the 103 outlets.

A problem has been identified between the balancing described in the PPDs and training

workbook and that detailed in the Horizon System User Guide. This has been checked
and the amendments made.

balancing. Outputs from these meetings will be fed directly into the Counter Managers
course,
