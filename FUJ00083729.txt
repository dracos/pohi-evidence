Subject: Statement - Porters Avenue SPSO

Andy

As discussed can you please provide me with a further statement exhibiting the 33 calls logged and can you send a copy of the exhibit
with a signed exhibit label. I apologise for the short notice but if possible could you send it out today to the address below by Special
Delivery. As you can appreciate with the trial starting on 17th May we are not left with much time to submit it to the court.

There is a mention at court tomorrow so I will let you know if the case is removed from the list or if it is still going ahead. The defence
are after some Fujitsu data so if the court make an order then I can see it being removed.
