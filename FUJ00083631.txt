[do not understand why this KEL 1s thought to cover aspects of an Agent
server, it talks about PM and Cleardesk and specifically only covers
counters. KEL JBallantyne5245K suggests reboot if PM stuck I doubt that the
pM is stuck at 01:41:42 are there multiple occurancies of the event. are
there > 1 instance of this per month? However this event has not been
jocumented with regard to TMSPOAcknowledge C_HV_POACK, I can see from the
essage store that Counter 3 processed this acknowledgement at 03:35 after
clear desk.
