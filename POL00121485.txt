Corporate Security Newsbrief Issue 28

Dear Colleague
Welcome to the latest edition of the Newsbrief.

In response to your feedback, amendments to policies will now be highlighted (the highlights to be removed after one
month) and we hope that this will prove helpful.

In addition to policy amendments, the updated Packages & Express plans are also on the database together with
articles concerning PACE, Information Security, surveillance forms, the July edition of Information Security News, plus
NVQ and Training updates.

Finally there are two more articles of interest in the Useful Information section concerning fire exit doors and theft in the
home delivery channel.

Please continue to feedback, whether good or bad, via this link {doclink : document

Information Security Policy
Information Security is YOUR Responsibility

Information is a valuable Consignia asset which needs to be protected and information security aims to protect this
asset against a wide range of threats.

As a Starting point we have published an Information Security eHandbook on the Consignia Intranet site, under
Personal Space, Guidelines. This handbook provides direction and advice on what you must do to ensure information is
secure both in and out of the workplace.

Please take the time to read the Information Security eHandbook and make sure you are familiar with the Consignia

Information Security Policy (S1).

Surveillance

Within forms CS095 and CS096, you will no doubt have noticed, and used, the relatively new section titled 'State the
level of surveillance to be undertaken (as defined in the Criminal Investigation Procedures, Safe Working Practices

Policy).

This section asks you to tick the appropriate box for ‘Standard’, ‘Intermediate’ or ‘Advanced! surveillance.

The only purpose for this question is to enable statistics to be collated on the type of surveillance operation we, as a
Community, are undertaking. This should, in the future, enable us to train the right amount of people to the right level.
