Hi Belinda

Thank you for this helpful note. Am fine to catch up later in the week, but could you please clarify a couple of
points first:

{a) did the Working Group agree its terms of reference on Friday

(b) did the Working Group consider any of the three individual case reports on Friday, and if so what was the
outcome?

(c) how Anthony Hooper agreed to stay on as Chair on a rolling basis (1 think his initial appointment was until
end March)?

I'm having a general catch up with Jenny at 1000 this morning, and it would be useful to have answers to these
questions (should she ask), so anything you can let me know by then would be much appreciated.

Best wishes and thanks,
Peter

Hi Peter
We discussed the possibility of a catch up tomorrow as it was looking possible that we may have Second
Sight report in the public domain very shortly.

Just to let you know, following the WG meeting on Friday it seems very unlikely that anything will be
agreed by the Working Group before early April.

Second Sight have been asked to finalise their 'thematic report’ by 26 March for consideration by the
WG the following week, and to concentrate on that rather than trying to do any more individual reports
at this stage.

I suggest that we catch up later in the week if necessary as we may have a better idea of where we are.
We should also have a better idea of what might happen re the MP's meeting but the latests assessment
is that SS will not be publishing anything in advance.

Best wishes
Belinda

Hi Sophie

Thanks for this - yes, had a short call with Belinda yesterday. It still sounds like a very difficult situation
- it would be useful to have a quick catch-up with you and Belinda early next week to discuss the
outcome of Friday's Working Group meeting. I have a couple of meetings at Old Street on Monday
morning, could I come and see you both at 10.00am for a chat?

Kind regards
Peter

Subject: Second Sight report

Hi Sophie

When Richie and James met you and Belinda a couple of weeks ago they reported that Second
Sight were due to issue their first report at the end of last week. I just wanted to check that this
was a case report for consideration by the working group, rather than a report for external
publication and consumption?

Many thanks
Peter
