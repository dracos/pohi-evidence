I am employed as a Financial Services and Bill Payments Manager for Post Office Ltd and
have been so employed since June 2009. I have worked in the Finance Division at

Chesterfield since 1995.

I have been asked by Jon Longman of the Post Office® Security Department to provide an

overview of how transaction corrections are processed.

it should be noted that Product & Branch Accounting work with electronic data streams and

that paper documentation is not available

TRANSACTION CORRECTIONS

Post Office Ltd branches are required to record transactional and remittance activity on the

Horizon system. The Horizon system can only record what the operator has told it has

If a dispute is accepted, or P&BA receive further information from other sources e.g. client,

further Horizon entries, to indicate the initial transaction correction is no longer valid, a

compensating transaction correction is issued.

Branches have 3 options when accepting transaction corrections:

Make good cash - either taking cash out (credits) or putting cash into the till (debits).
Make good cheque - putting a cheque into the till to make up a cash shortfall.

Settle centrally (over £150 only) - this does not impact the Horizon cash position and
transfers the debt or credit onto a Customer Account. This is then recovered via the debt

recovery process within P&BA. This option does allow branches additional time to find

information to support the issue of a compensating transaction.

All transaction corrections need to be accepted prior to monthly branch trading rollovers.

I have explained three transaction corrections below for West Byfleet Post Office® between
2005 to January 2008. To explain in detail every transaction correction for West Byfleet Post
Office® would be a major resourcing issue. However, if specific transaction corrections can

be identified that require explanations then this could be addressed.

Example 1

The third example on the branch transaction record dated 19.12.2005 related to a £397.08
transaction correction relating to a pre order of US dollars. Here the dollars would have been
delivered to the branch and collected and paid for by the customer. However the sale has not
been identified as being recorded on Horizon and therefore the branch will be in an apparent
surplus position which will be corrected by the transaction correction.

However on 9.1.2006 an equal an opposite transaction correction was issued. This indicates
that the sale has retrospectively been entered in to Horizon or the branch has contacted the
issuing team to explain why the transaction correction would not be proper to the branch.
The most likely reason for this would be that the customer had not in fact collected and paid
for the dollars. The branch would then be instructed to return the currency to First Rate
(Post Office Ltd foreign currency supplier) and, on receipt, the compensating transaction

correction issued.

Continuation of statement of Carole CROSS.

Not all transaction corrections are caused by the branch.

Transaction correction issued 31/8/07 was generated by a failure of a cash remittance scan
on despatch to Cash Centre. The cash was delivered to the cash centre but the value
remained in the branch accounts as “Cash in Pouches”. The transaction correction clears
(debits) the “Cash in Pouches” in the branch and credits the Cash Centre cash balances to

reflect what actually happened.

Example 3

Not all transaction corrections directly impact cash.

Transaction correction issued corrected the volume of scratchcards remitted into the branch
following activation on the Camelot terminal. If the branch has already “corrected” the
volume of scratchcards in the branch by “adjusting stock” then an equal and opposite
adjustment will be needed to correct the scratchcard position.

Adjusting stock upwards acts as negative sales and would create a gain in a branch.
Conversely adjusting stock downwards creates a loss.

There is no overall financial impact on the branch but if the adjustments take place at

different times then gains and losses will appear.
