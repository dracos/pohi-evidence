Audit of Post Office ® Marine Drive branch, FAD 213337

An audit took place at Marine Drive Post Office on the 25" March 2004.
Helen Hollingworth led the audit and in attendance was Chris Taylor. The audit
commenced at 8.00am and on our arrival the sub postmaster was very pleased to
see us. He explained problems he had been having at the office regarding
balancing. His problems with balancing started in week 43 with a mis-balance of
~4230.97. He was adamant that no members of staff could be committing theft
and felt that the mis-balances were due to a computer problem. He had been in
contact with the Retail Line Manager Cath Oglesby and the Horizon help line
regularly since the problems began. The following table gives further weeks
balance declarations on the cash account.

48 -3509.18
46 = -8243.10
45 = -6730.01
44 = -6754.09
43° -4230.97

48 -3509.18 This amount put into suspense week 49
48 -8243.10 This amount put into suspense week 47

45 = -6730.01 Rolled loss
44 -6754.09
43 -4230.97

In week 47 £8243.10 was put into suspense. Although horizon had been
contacted and the Retail Line was aware of this figure, this was not authorised. in
week 49 £3509.68 was added to make the amount carried in the suspense
account total £11752.78. This was also not authorised.

week 51 balance -£11210.56
suspense account -£11752.78
expected audit result - £22563.34
difference at audit - £2795.41 (-£1769.00 lottery -£1026.41 cash)
audit result - £25758.75

On the completion of the audit the Retail Line Manager Cath Oglesby was
contacted, along with the Investigation team and the Audit Line Manager. The
sub postmaster was suspended pending enquiries and an interim postmaster was
put in charge at the office.
