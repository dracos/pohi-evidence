                                                         Dated: 21 June 2023


                          POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY


                FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF CHRSTINE THIRSK




I, Christine Thirsk, will say as follows...


Introduction



  1. I am a former employee of Marine Drive Post Office and held the position of

     Counter Clerk. At the relevant time my name was Christine Train. It is now

     Christine Thirsk.

  2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the

     "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 06 June 2023 (the

     "Request").

  3. To assist me in preparing this witness statement, I have reviewed various

     documents provided to me by the Inquiry. These were POL00083641;

     P0L00074092; P0L00074091; P0L00083031; P0L00071592; P0L00072786;

     P0L00069282; P0L00069279; LCAS0000607_004 and P0L00071236.



Experience at Marine Drive Post Office

  4. I have been asked to set out a summary of my career at Marine Drive Post Office.

     I started working at this branch in January 1986 under the YTS scheme at the time.


                                          Page 1 of 12
                                                                                            WITNO9470100
                                                                                        WITNO9470100




   After 2 years, I became a permanent member of staff. By this time, I was working

   more hours in the Post Office than the sub-postmistress. When the premises were

   sold, I trained the next incoming Sub-postmaster ("SPM") and another new

   member of staff. When Mr. Castleton took over, I also trained him and

   subsequently more new staff.


5. In respect of my experience of the Horizon system prior to Mr. Castleton being

   appointed SPM, I can confirm we experienced no issues with the Horizon IT

   system.


6. In respect of my experience of working with Mr. Castleton from June 2003, I can

   confirm that he learnt the role extremely quickly and worked hard at getting to know

   the customers that we had and their needs.


7. In respect of my working relationship with Mr. Castleton, he was by far the best

   SPM I had worked for. We got on extremely well from the start and worked together

   very well to make a good team.


8. In respect of the working relationship between Catherine Oglesby and Mr.

   Castleton, it was polite / professional but always of a feeling that she didn't really

   like him for no apparent reason. Apparently, at Mr. Castleton's initial interview for

   SPM, Catherine Oglesby hadn't appeared impressed that he attended on his own.

   Mrs. Castleton did not go with him as planned due to her mother being in a car

   accident the day before. As a retail line manager, she had the power to close an

   office and had already `threatened' the previous owners with that if they hadn't

   tidied up the appearance of the office. It was as if she wanted to exert her authority

   from day 1 over Mr. Castleton.

                                                                                        WITN09470100




9. In respect of the events of the Week 42 balancing, everything was ok until the final

    balance showed the first shortfall. As standard practice, we went through all the

    cash and stock again and any relevant documentation in the office. It was unusual

    that nothing turned up. We declared the balance but checked everything again

    over the next few days but to no avail. We contacted the usual partners with a view

    to receiving an error notice that something had inadvertently been sent off without

    being accounted for but again, nothing.


10. In respect of Catherine Oglesby's visits to the branch from 16 January 2004

    onwards, throughout this whole episode she insisted that someone was taking the

    money, which was categorically denied by us all. We requested that she involve

    the Fraud Dept and Police if that is what she believed but nothing happened. We

    were already double-checking figures before they left the office as standard

    working practices anyway, so we were given no new guidance or information.


11. In respect of the weeks before Mr. Castleton's suspension, to encounter continuing

    shortfalls was devastating and frustrating to say the least, especially after we were

    making daily calls to all the relevant parties that we should have done and getting

    no new answers as to what might have been happening. I myself was going to the

    Post Office at 7am and staying until 7pm going over the same figures and

    paperwork just to find nothing new.


12. In respect of the shortfalls, we knew no one had taken the money and all

    transactions had been carried out correctly. As the shortfalls began happening on

    such a regular basis it could only be the Horizon system in our opinion.

                                                                                          WITNO9470100




 13. In respect of the subsequent visits made to the branch by Catherine Oglesby after

     16 January 2004, her only suggestion was to start working with split stock so we

     each had our own stock to work with. I can't recall why it didn't happen, but I

     requested for us to work manually for a short period and not use the Horizon

     system at all. Catherine agreed to this but later denied it under oath. Instead, she

     called the auditors in the same week. We requested to work manually to take the

     Horizon system out of the equation to prove we could get an accurate balance and

     no more shortages. I asked Catherine Oglesby if that was an option and she

     agreed. At Mr. Castleton's trial, she denied it.


 14. In respect of calls made to the Horizon Helpline, there were many. Daily calls were

     made regarding the shortfalls, but no real help given other than to tell us to do what

     we were already doing as normal practice (checking everything before it left the

     office or came in i.e. stock and cash). Both Mr. Castleton and I made all the calls

     to the Helpline.


 15. In respect of my working relationship with Catherine Oglesby during this time, it

     was strained as you would expect due to her insistence that we were taking

     the money constantly.


Investigation and Audit


 16. In respect of the audit on 25 March 2004, it was performed as any other would be

     as far as I can remember.


 17. In respect of the information / documentation the auditor considered, I believe it to

     have been the reports produced during the working week just the same as we

     would have checked.

                                       Page 4 of 12
                                                                                              WITNO9470100
                                                                                          WITN09470100




18. In respect of the auditor and the apparent shortfalls, we reiterated again that we

    thought the Horizon system was at fault. We now know that this was the truth and

    Fujitsu and the Post Office knew it.


19. In respect of Mr. Castleton's suspension, it was heartbreaking that it had come to

    that as we felt we had had no support whatsoever and were continuously branded

    as thieves.


20. In respect of Mr. Castleton's suspension, I was also removed from the office by

    Catherine Oglesby as on several occasions she voiced her opinion that the staff

    must have taken the money. When Dorothy Day began as the temporary SPM two

    months later, Catherine Oglesby was suddenly very keen to have me working back

    in the office. I don't believe Catherine Oglesby ever gave Dorothy Day a reason

    why she was so keen to have me back working in the post office. She asked if

    she would be prepared to have me working alongside her in the post office. It was

    a sudden turnaround of attitude as for months Catherine Oglesby had been

    adamant that the staff were taking the money.


Subsequent SPMs


21. In respect of an initial meeting with Ruth Simpson, I can't recall anything significant

    other than the usual introductions.


22. In respect of the working relationship between Catherine Oglesby and Ruth

    Simpson, it was very clear that they were extremely friendly. Their whole

    demeanor and body language gave that impression. We suspect Ruth Simpson

    was selected specifically by Catherine Oglesby to run the post office as should



                                      Page 5 of 12
                                                                                           WITN09470100
                                                                                       WITNO9470100




     anything occur that was to be 'covered up' then she was friendly enough with her

     to do it. That was the impression from how they interacted that we all got.


 23. In respect of any issues experienced between 23rd March and 21st April 2004, as

     I was not allowed to work in the Post Office at that time I wouldn't have known if

     there was any unless Ruth Simpson said there was. We all felt that had there been

     an issue then it would have been 'covered up' anyway. As it was, she did not use

     the Horizon system until at least lunchtime on her first day, and no reason was

     given. We strongly suspected that an upgrade to the system occurred during that

     time. I don't recall an instance of the system requiring a reboot / screen freezing

     but that was a regular occurrence along with keyboard issues. If the Horizon

     system really had no issues as we were being told, then why did Ruth Simpson

     not use it straight away? If the staff were the cause of the shortages, then she

     should have had every confidence to use it to start a new working week. That just

     did not add up to any of us.


 24. In respect of an initial meeting with Mr. Greg Booth, I can't recall anything

     significant other than the usual introductions.


 25. In respect of any issues with the Horizon system between 21St April and 28th May

     2004, as I was not allowed to work in the Post Office at that time I wouldn't know

     if there were any.


Mr. Castleton's Suspension Interview


 26. In respect of the interview on 10th May 2004, this was a long time ago but was an

     extremely frustrating time and disappointing outcome, having felt we had had no

     constructive help from Catherine Oglesby, Post Office or Fujitsu looking into

                                       Page 6 of 12
                                                                                           WITNO9470100
                                                                                       WITN09470100




     anything we had said. The more shortages appeared on our weekly balance, the

     more certain we were. We knew neither myself nor Mr. Castleton had taken the

     money and we knew our working practices were good. We had had no issues for

     the 6 months previous even when Mr. Castleton was new in post. By the time the

     court case was over, more of the same scenarios and stories were hitting the news

     of the exact same events happening to other PM's.


Marine Drive Post Office after Mr. Castleton's Termination


 27. In respect of working with Dorothy Day, she immediately listened to what had

     happened and began to agree with myself and Mr. Castleton. For some

     unexplained reason, Catherine Oglesby requested that I work with her in the Post

     Office. There was no reason for me to no longer be kept out of it. She supported

     us from day one and did everything to help get the business back on track that had

     been lost due to the previous two temporary SPMs. Dorothy immediately found

     that a double final balance had been undertaken previously which was meant to

     be impossible to do? Dorothy had had some unexplained outcomes of balances

     at the office she used to own. Nothing on the scale that we suffered but still

     balances showing a gain that never had a reason. When Dorothy Day began

     looking at the paperwork produced by Ruth Simpson, she found final balances

     done twice that should not have been possible to action by a SPM.


 28. In respect of visits by Catherine Oglesby during Dorothy's time in the Post Office,

     I can't recall there being that many.


The Civil Proceedings brought against Mr. Castleton by the Post Office (Post

Office Limited v Lee Castleton)

                                                                                        WITNO9470100




29. In respect of the Post Office bringing civil proceedings against Mr. Castleton, I

    believe he would have been the one to make me aware.


30. In respect of the case against Mr. Castleton, I understood it to be contractual.


31. In respect of Mr. Castleton's Defense and Counterclaim, I was aware of both and

    agreed with Mr. Castleton that the Horizon system was at fault as has now been

    proved. The Counterclaim could not be anything other than contractual as no fraud

    or theft had taken place and no evidence of it.


32. In respect of the letter from Stephen Dilley to me dated 22 August 2006

   [POL00083319_038], after 19 years it is hard to recall that I received that, but I

    probably did. I would not have acted as a witness for the Post Office under the

    circumstances.


33. In respect of a final version of this letter, I do not remember receiving one, but a

    lot of years have passed and there was a lot to deal with at the time.


34. In respect of discussions with the legal representatives for the Post Office, I don't

    recall being contacted by anyone.


35. In respect of being a witness for Mr. Castleton, as a member of his staff working

    in the Post Office throughout the shortages there was no doubt that I would be a

    witness for him.


36. In respect of contact with Rowe Cohen, I did attend a meeting with them and Mr.

    Castleton in respect of our evidence / statements as you would expect to.

 37. In respect of why Mr. Castleton stopped using Rowe Cohen, he could not afford

     the fees once his insurance cover had reached the limit of costs. He had no choice

     but to defend himself.


 38. In respect of my witness statement, I wrote the truth of what happened.


 39. In respect of seeing other witness statements before the trial, I don't recall having

     access to them.


 40. In respect of the attendance note of my call with Stephen Dilley [POL00072682], I

     don't recall it or what was discussed.


 41. In respect of the approach by the Post Office in relation to these proceedings, it

     was nothing more than bully boy tactics and to make Mr. Castleton an example to

     any other SPMs claiming the Horizon system was at fault also.


 42. In respect of the Approved Judgment in Post Office Limited v Lee Castleton

     [POL00004325], it was no surprise considering how much money the Post Office

     was prepared to spend on a top legal team.


 43. In respect of the outcome of the case I don't recall being provided with a copy,

     but Mr. Castleton did inform me. The outcome was no surprise considering how

     many of the Post Office witnesses blatantly lied under oath knowing what we

     know now.


Other Matters


 44. In respect of any issues with the Horizon IT system after the trial, I believe there

     was a system upgrade or intervention from the first day of Ruth Simpson being in


                                       Page 9 of 12

                                                                                         WITNO9470100




     Marine Drive. The Horizon system was not used until lunchtime on her first day,

     for no reason other than 'she chose not to use it'? From the time.l was able to

     start working in the office again until the Post Office closed the branch making

     me redundant, there were no significant issues.




 46 In respect of the trial, it was brought to court with the intention of making an

     example to other SPMs of what would happen. It was never about the money to




     everyone now knows the hundreds of SPM's in this position were right with what

     we were saying and to constantly hear do the news how much was covered up

     by the Post Office and Fujitsu is frankly an insult and disgusting. It has been

     extremely hard to revisit this period of my life and I am certain anyone that has

     been requested to provide a witness statement will feel the same. I don't doubt

     that any of the people in certain positions will ever be accountable for the lies

     they told under oath in court, but justice needs to be done for all involved.




Statement of Truth,
I believe the content of this statement to be true.
