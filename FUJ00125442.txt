Charles,

As discussed, I've checked up on my emails.

1 Iwas asked on 7! December some specific questions about the case

2. I was sent a copy of your second report (and the diagram) on the same day and provided my initial
response on 17'h December

3. I believe that this was converted into a witness statement and returned to POL in early February

As I said on the phone, Fujitsu are responsible for the full processing of Card Transactions, though the actual
settlement and manual resolution of reconciliation errors / non-payments is carried out by POL. However any
such reconciliation corrections would result in Transaction Corrections (TCs) being processed for the Branch
which would be visible in the Branch accounts. I’ve checked through all the TCs in the logs and there are
none associated with Credit / Debit Card payments during the 13 months of details logs and there are 4
associated with banking transactions (three deposits and one withdrawal) with a total absolute value of
£1,840, so I don’t see how any of this can be relevant to the losses in the branch.

Regards

Gareth
