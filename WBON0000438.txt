Dear Andy,

I've had a quick look at the drafting and I don't think it will wash. First of all, we appear to have ignored the second route by which I
understand it is possible for data to be altered remotely - the one that involves PO and has happened only once since 2010.

Second, we boldly say that they haven't given proper particulars of our concealment of the remote data alteration facility, but for years
virtually every document we submitted positively said that data could not be altered remotely. We need to say something that at least
provides a basis for explaining how we came to do this, even if we can't bring ourselves actually to acknowledge that we have made
false statements in the past and to explain why.

We must me that this letter is going to be pored over for many hours at trial, at which time the court will know everything.
Attempting to brush this under the carpet to avoid short term embarrassment would do profound damage to our long term credibility.
In my view it would be the worst possible thing to do. It really is the case that in many cases cover ups give a much worse impression
and are much more serious than the things sought to be covered up (in this case, our previous inconsistent statements).

It may well be that I have got the wrong end of the stick, but this drafting makes me very nervous indeed.
Talk tomorrow?
Tony

Please find attached the latest version of the letter — this hasn't materially changed since your amendments. I've highlighted in Blue in
the attached letter where these two sections on remote access will be fit in — see pages 22 and 45.

Kind regards

Andy

Ok. I see it's only a small section anyway. Could you send me the longer version you've taken it from? I don't want to read and review

it, I just want to get the context clear in my head

Dear Andy,

I'm more or less at my budget limit. What do I do?

Best wishes,

Tony,
Would you mind reviewing the attached wording on the remote access issues?
Having reviewed the Letter of Claim, the remote access point is only specifically raised in relation to limitation / s.32 concealment,

Itis not cited as a ground for (i) deceit or (ii) unwinding the settlement agreements — although it could in due course be used for these
purposes.

We have expressly referred to balancing transactions and Super User access in the attached, without drawing specific attention to
them. Is this transparent enough or should we go further?

Kind regards

Andy
