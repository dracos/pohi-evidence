Subject: FW: PO/BIS meeting on Second Sight investigation
Hi both

I have just spoken to Karen and the only time that works for Will, Mike and Peter on Friday is 9:30am, will that work
for Alwen & Mark? They are going to come over to Old Street — as Paula needs her room, is there any chance we could
use one of yours?

Many Thanks

Sarah

Hi Sarah — please could you liaise with Karen at Shex (copied) to arrange a meeting for Alwen and me with Will, Mike
and Peter next Friday on the above topic? Suggest we put aside 1 hour. Mark (Davies) will also attend if he can.

(Will/Mike/Peter — to explain, we’re probably not going to get sight of the draft report until Friday so no point
scheduling the meeting any sooner. But we can obviously keep in touch on the phone in the meantime).

It can wait until Monday to fix!
Happy weekends to all.

Many thanks,
Martin
