Dear Mr Wilcox,

I write to acknowledge your recent e-mail to DS Gareth Goddard and to introduce myself as a future
point of contact. I have discussed the Robberies with Gareth at length and the exhaustive enquiries
that were undertaken. There is no evidence at this time to support the fact that Susan RUDKIN
fabricated this offence in order to steal monies. Without fresh evidence I do not propose to re-open
this offence after this amount of time; and decline the invitation to re-interview Mrs Rudkin.

I propose that you continue as planned with the theft charges.
Regards
David Bacon

Detective Sergeant 81

North West CID.
