To provide an updated and conformed Agreement that reflects changes specified in
those CCNs approved by the parties between 24/07/2015 and 31/03/2016 (as listed
below) and updating all Clauses and Schedules to produce the updated and
conformed Version 11.0 of the Agreement.

This CCN1604b also incorporates further minor changes to the Agreement to form
Version 11.0 of the Agreement.

Summary:

Fujitsu Services provides services to Post Office under an agreement dated 28/07/99
(the “Agreement’). CCN1200 varied and restated the Agreement and comprised the
baseline set of the Clauses and Schedules as at 31/08/06.

More recently, CCN1506 introduced a new baseline set of Clauses and Schedules to
the Agreement to reflect amendments made by those CCNs approved by the parties
between 30/09/2013 and 24/07/2015 and a number of amendments, including
contract anomalies and CCD reference updates, to change all Schedules and
Clauses to produce the updated and conformed version 10.0 of the Agreement.

This CCN1604b introduces a new baseline set of Clauses and Schedules to the
Agreement to reflect amendments made by those CCNs approved between
24/07/2015 and 31/03/2016 and a number of amendments, including contract
anomalies and to change all Schedules and Clauses to version 11.0 of the
Agreement.

Version 11.0 of the Agreement therefore includes all changes introduced by this
CCN1604b together with the changes introduced by the following CCNs:

1) CCN1423c

2) CCN1424
3) CCN1425

DETAILS OF CHANGE:

Post Office and Fujitsu Services agree as follows:

1.

Attachment 1 to this CCN (“Attachment 1”) contains the new electronic
versions of the Clauses and Schedules of the Agreement (version 11.0)
which will replace the existing version 10.0 of the Agreement and include
the changes as described in this CCN1604b.

Version 11.0 of the Agreement shall comprise as at 31/03/2016 the
Clauses and the Schedules set out in Attachment 1.

In the event of any inconsistency, the Clauses and the Schedules in
Attachment 1 shall prevail over any printed version.

In the event of any inconsistency between what is set out in Attachment 1
as being Version 11 and the content of any of the CCN’s which feed into
Version 11 (as listed above), the content of the CCN’s should prevail.

As described in the “Details of Change” section above and shown in the changes
described below.

The changes below describe the tidy up changes that have been applied to version
11.0 of the Schedules to the Agreement.

CLAUSES:

CCN1600 required a new Clause 76 to be included. However, as a Clause 76
already exists within the Agreement, a new Clause 77 has instead been added.

SCHEDULE 1

CCN1423c states to amend the definition of “Local Failure” as:

“(a) In the period up to 31% March 2015, a failure of the Branch Infrastructure and/or
the Branch Telecom Infrastructure;

(b) In the period from 1“ April 2015, a failure of the Branch Telecom Infrastructure;”

The amendments were made as per CCN1423c, with two additional changes. The
word “and” was added at the end of paragraph (a) after the semi-colon and the semi
colon at the end of paragraph (b) was removed and replaced with a full stop.

SCHEDULE AS

CCN1423c states to add an additional paragraph 1.8 as follows:

“4.8 From 1 April 2015, in relation to Fujitsu continuing to deliver Services which
previously had dependencies on the Engineering Service and to facilitate Fujitsu’s
delivery of those Services, Post Office will be responsible for:

1.8.1 for planning the timings of Counter Gold Build releases and requesting
them, using the Change Control Procedure;

1.8.2 the Next Supplier accepting and resolving Incidents raised in respect of
Branch Hardware requiring repair or replacement, identified through pro-

active monitoring;
1.8.3 the Next Supplier accepting and fulfilling requests to perform

investigation, repair or replacement activities on Branch Hardware (e.g. quiet
line test or branch router reset) to support the resolution of Incidents”

The amendments were made as per CCN1423c, with two additional changes. The
word “and” was added at the end of sub-paragraph 1.8.2 after the semi-colon and a
full stop was added to the end of sub-paragraph 1.8.3.

SCHEDULE B3.1 — HNG-X SERVICES AND TRANSITIONAL SUPPORT
SERVICES:

CCN1600 states:

“The whole of row 17, relating to POL MI Hosting Service shall be deleted. In
paragraph 4, row 47 which refers to the POL MI Service Description, shall be
deleted.”

This change has been made, and in addition, any rows proceeding those rows
deleted have been renumbered accordingly to follow in succession.

SCHEDULE D1 — CHARGES:

CCN1600 states that paragraph 2.14 should be deleted and replaced. However,
paragraph 2.14 did not exist to be deleted and replaced, and therefore a new Clause
2.14 has been added. In addition, it was unclear which Annex B was referred to in
paragraph 2.14. Fujitsu Services and Post Office agree that the reference is intended

to be to Annex B of Schedule D1, which includes Trinity 1 Credit and Invest to Save
Credit. For clarity, Version 11 of Annex B of Schedule D1 takes into account
amendments from CCN1600, CCN1501a and CCN1512c.

SCHEDULE E- ANNEX 1:

CCN1423c stated that the table contained in Annex 1 should be amended as follows:

Engineeri I Terminable as I Signature by I Process, toolset, SLT and
ng Service I an individual both Parties I operational service threshold
Service of CCN 1200 I implications on Service Desk
Expired f Service and Operational
(Expired as of i
xpired BS 9 Business Change (Branch
31 March
2015 Change) Service and on
2015) availability SLTs

The table was then overridden by CCN1600 which did not contain the amendment
“(Expired as of 31% March 2015)” from CCN1423c above.

Fujitsu Services and Post Office agree that the table in Annex 1 should be amended
to read as set out above, as per CCN1423c.

COMMERCIAL TERMS or CHARGES APPLICABLE IN RESPECT OF THIS
CCN (if any):

There is no cost for implementing this CCN1604b but, where applicable, price
amendments specified in those CCNs approved between 24/07/2015 and
31/03/2016 inclusive as referenced in this CCN1604b will be applied to the relevant

Action Number: 2 Date Apr 11 2016 15:59:37 By: Ken. Westfield

CCB Minutes ~ Mtg 836 — 11" April 2016

Draft CCN presented to CCB by K Wilson as formalising Baseline 11 and incorporating all
the CCNs approved to date (including POLSAP CCN1512c and Trinity - 1600).

Draft CCN had been produced by Commercial and agreed by Finance and Change

Commercial confirmed that the change was being expedited through to provide a clean
baseline for both parties and for Fujitsu to be able to progress the RPI CCN (1603) to
incorporate the baselined position.

The attachment to the CCN was all the Schedules at v11 and these were being finalised.
The draft documentation had been reviewed by POL informally

A Kemp asked whether the CCN contained any clean-ups and C Dunford stated it did not —
once baselined a clean-up CCN would be raised and progressed.

CCB had no further comment and agreed progression of the Change on completion of
actions:

Actions:
1. Commercial to provide copy of CCN attachment for formal submission.
