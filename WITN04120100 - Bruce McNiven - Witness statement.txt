POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF JAMES BRUCE McNIVEN

|, MR JAMES BRUCE MCNIVEN, will say as follows:

Introduction

. This statement responds to the Rule 9 request dated 8 June 2022. This statement is
dated 17 September 2022. The statement sets out my involvement with the Horizon
Project between 1996 and 1999, part of which time | was Deputy Director of the
Programme Delivery Authority and latterly General Manager, Horizon
Implementation Team.

. Because of the passage of time since my last period of employment on anything
connected with the Horizon Programme between 1999 and now, it is being provided
to the best of my recollection and with reference to the released documents.

Professional background

. [had been employed by the Post Office since 1973. Initially this employment was
with the Post Office Regions as part of a combined business prior to being divided
between Post Office Counters Ltd and Royal Mail in 1986. In 1986 | was appointed
as District Manager for POCL in Newcastle. This comprised an area from the
Scottish border to York on the Eastern side of the Pennines. On restructuring in
1993 | was appointed Head of Retail Network for the NE area

4. In 1996 | was invited to take up the post of Deputy Director at the Programme
Delivery Authority, leading the team of POCL staff seconded to the Programme and
working alongside the DSS team as joint customer representatives to the contracted
Supplier.

5. My responsibilities as the Programme Deputy Director within the Programme
Delivery Authority were;

- To represent the Post Office interests in the management of the relationship
with Fujitsu (“ Pathway” ) and DSS (Benefits Agency) through a joint team
headed up by a BA appointed Programme Director,

- To assist in the overall management and coordination of the programme and
user requirements, leading to eventual sign off,

- To manage on a day-to-day basis, the POCL staff assigned to the Programme,

- To ensure the Post Office staff were managed in a way consistent with the
POCL business ethos and to provide a link between the programme and the
business,

- To ensure a purposeful and co-operative working arrangement between the 2
parties involved in the Programme Authority organisation and beyond into the

wider BA and Post Office community.

6. During 1996 and 1997 my involvement was primarily through the joint working
arrangements with BA (as part of the Programme Delivery Authority) and through
them with Anderson Consulting. We met regularly with Pathway representatives to
discuss progress towards the various milestones in the development plan and
reported back to the joint BA/PO Programme Board.

7. As far as | can recall, the only active software release in this period was designated
as CONGO 4 (Pathway 1(c)) which was introduced in mid - 1997. It was intended to
support limited functionality at an initial 100 offices in the NE and SW Regions.

8. The offices involved were trained and migrated on to the system. Within the contract
terms Pathway were responsible for the software. The functionality at the offices

was monitored and exception reports raised as appropriate. In addition, Model

Page 2 of 13
WITNO04120100
WITNO4120100

Office Testing was set up to undertake the joint testing strategy agreed between
POL Pathway and BA, using a shared set of tests. Progress and exception reports

were generated and reviewed.

9. Anumber of implementation risks to the overall programme were identified around
the CAPS (BA payment system) and the Pathway software release interfaces. The
programme plan current at the time required inter-connectivity between the two
systems and was at the heart of replans as Pathway reported slippage on delivery
timescales.

10. In this period, a major report was completed by PA Consulting. The report is
available among the released documents (WITN0412_01/01; POL00028092). They
identified a raft of issues around implementation of the overall plan and emphasised
the time spent in the PDA resolving issues with Pathway and the inherent difficulties
in managing a PFI contract. They also questioned some of the software
development strategies within the Pathway model and for the first time questioned
the payment card viability.

11. Early visibility of the training programme raised concerns around effectiveness and

evaluation. The need for planned remedial training was first identified at this stage.

12. Operational implementation risks identified around the Initial Go Live stage were
limited to equipment failures and ISDN availability.

13.My involvement with technical issues was limited to their impacts on timescales and
potential restrictions on functionality available to Post Offices. Business continuity
status reports at the time included inactive payment cards and temporary loss of
transactions.

14. Technical difficulties arising at IGL offices were addressed by Pathway with
oversight by the PDA Testing Team. My understanding of the joint testing
philosophy was to design a testing regime which would test the functionality of the
solution designed by Pathway and prove its ability to support the Business

requirements as detailed in the contract. Changes to these requirements arose and

Page 3 of 13
WITNO04120100
WITNO4120100

were tracked through a change control system. Overall, the core elements of live

status were reported as satisfactory, as far as they went at that stage.

15.As | recall, the impact of the PA report began to see the migration of functions and
staff back into their host organisations and the role of the PDA as a joint body,

reduced.

16. The testing of functionality, security and end to end processes was increasingly
undertaken by additional resource within Post Office responsibilities, involving

contractors and staff diverted from other parts of the business structure.

17.New POL forums were established, such as the Release Authorisation Board and
the Automation Transformation Steering Group. There was an increasing
requirement for acceptance to have clear separation of boundaries between BA and

POL within Pathway systems. | believe functionality testing followed that change.

18. The Horizon implementation team was set up in POL, in which | continued to have a
general management role. | attended authorisation and development meetings with

Pathway from a planning and roll out timescale perspective.

19.My understanding of technical difficulties was gained from attendance at progress
meetings with Pathway. | still retained a relationship management and
communications role with BA, so understood the implications attendant to the issues
at the interface of CAPS and Pathway releases, but not at a level of technical

granularity.

20. The IT development issues and risk were retained by Pathway and, as | recall, not

visible to Post Office people or in combined risk registers.

21. The forums for addressing technical difficulties set up within the POL Horizon
hierarchy were the Release Authorisation Board, Transformational Steering Group
and ongoing progress meeting with Pathway. Horizon testing was on the
Transformation Steering Group agenda from July 1998. There were reports feeding

into these bodies providing impact assessment in a traffic light risk format.

Page 4 of 13
WITNO04120100
WITNO4120100

22.My engagement with these reports was essentially to assess impact on roll out
timescales and readiness. | would contribute informed judgement as far as | could to

agreed resolution actions on functionality issues.

23. Action arising out of these progress meetings mainly comprised directions to those

in direct contact with Pathway developers to seek resolution and report back.

24. Earlier in 1998, Pathway produced their high level Infrastructure and Roll Out Plan.
The purpose of the Horizon implementation team at this time was to interface with
Pathway to provide assurance on the viability of the roll out plan and informed input
on its construction relative to the Post Office estate.

25. Initially the contract envisioned Pathway as the prime mover in setting dates,
timescales, processes for migration at offices and staff training.

26. Much of this became integrated with the POL Horizon Implementation team and
further incorporated required physical changes to offices, liaison with logistics and
feedback of issues with migration from office-held data to the Horizon platform.
Importantly it assessed training and communication from initial contact through the

training episodes themselves and to post-implementation support.

27.| had overall responsibility for the POL Horizon Implementation Team and issue

management with BA and Pathway and was a sign-off authority for the roll out Plan.

28.As | recall, the technical interface provided to support migration did not always
perform a smooth transfer of data from the existing manual cash account on to the
Horizon platform. There were also issues around the need to close offices and the
time taken to complete the migration, sometimes into late hours.

29. Training had been an issue with Pathway throughout the planning stage. There was
an agreed extension of awareness training pre-installation and reinforcement on the
day. Pathway eventually extended the content and time available but as | recall,

were consistently unwilling to be involved in training needs arising from the impact

Page 5 of 13
WITNO04120100

WITNO4120100

on inherited POL systems.

30. As far as | recall at that stage, some of the interface issues were addressed but
Pathway were reluctant to engage with a system outside their development. Training
was improved and again, as | recall, additional content and time allocated for each
office implementation. However, training was consistently raised as a primary
concern and eventually became the core of a formal Installation Incident
(“ Installation Incident 218” ). These Incidents could be raised by BA and POL and
were visible to all parties. They would normally address a perceived failure by
Pathway to meet a required success criterion. They were then logged for discussion
and resolution. A log of incidents is contained in POL00029130 (WITN0412_01/02).
31. Testing continued in the Model Office environment and work on release of software

for Live Trial continued. Integrated work with BA systems also progressed.

32. The substance of technical difficulties is reported in the documentation
(WITN0412_01/03; POL00028429). My position continued to be that of interpreting
progress on problem resolution relative to moving into Live Trial and Roll Out from a
logistical, support and communication perspective.

33. Various forums existed; principally the Checkpoint meeting with Pathway, POL
Horizon Management Team Meetings and with BA through the CAPS Board
Meetings.

34.As | understand, the technical issues were addressed between the Horizon testing

and release team and Pathway.
35. Testing continued on the functionality associated with the Pathway release for Live
Trial. | believe much of the end-to-end testing was done in the model office

Environment.

36.1 understood, that concerns remained in end-to-end testing and with the robustness
of reference data for development of the migration processes.

My source of understanding was via the reports submitted to the POL Horizon Team

Meetings.

The Post Office and Benefits Agency by then were moving in different directions
relative to an integrated solution featuring a payments card. My perception was that
different positions were developing on the scope and adequacy and outcomes of
testing as expressed through their Programme Board. Their major concerns
appeared to be the impact of failure on the security and viability of the overall benefit
payment system and its constituent parts. | believe they reserved their position on

release authorisation until assurances that their concerns were addressed.

The preparation of Post Office branches for automation was part of an extensive roll
out plan, integrated with Pathways programme of logistics — particularly the
assurance of the delivery of equipment to post offices as required by the roll out
programme and the availability of teams to check the connectivity to each office.
This sat alongside the training and communication plan, and the development and

testing of user manuals

Training had been tested ahead of the scheduling of Live Trial and there were
expressed concerns by the POL implementation team about the time being made
available to each office by the Pathway training schedule. This and other issues
were being negotiated through the incident resolution process. The key Incident was
no. 218 (referenced in para 30 above) and was increasingly a part of high-level
exchanges between POL and Pathway (WITN0412_01/04; FUJ00079159). In
essence we were increasingly concerned the product was not fit for purpose.

The Pathway-developed migration tool, for transfer of office data to the Horizon

platform experienced early difficulties.
The call up and availability of Sub Postmasters and their staff in offices was also

predicted to be on-going difficulty. As | recall, office closures were largely to be
avoided. Migration on to the system was at risk of being drawn out and complex.

WITNO4120100

43. Through negotiation with Pathway, migration technology was improved. The POL
implementation team stood its ground but a conclusion of the training issues was not

achieved until the latter part of 1999

44. My understanding was that the underlying system was robust and that errors and
bugs would be resolved as installation progressed. The training product had been

tested and refined but was still not regarded as acceptable.

45. There was a view that delivery into the Sub Office estate would be affected by the
age, experience and technical awareness of Sub Postmasters and their staff but that
would improve with usage and confidence in the system as long as training and

support was effective.

46. The hugely complex processes surrounding the physical readiness of outlets to
receive and install the horizon equipment was given significant attention and back
up plans were instigated. It was around this time that Pathway carried out a

reorganisation of their Implementation Team.

47. The period from May to September 1999 covers the initial responses to the limited
live trial and leading up to the conditional acceptance for roll out. At that time, |
understood additional testing was carried out in the model office environment to
replicate issues in outlets. There was a high-level register of revealed issues which

was constantly addressed in discussions with Pathway.

48.As | recall, and with the help of the released documentation, the technical difficulties
at that time included system lock outs, discrepancies in cash accounts — and
although not specifically technical — deficiencies in the support at the Horizon

Support Helpdesk for advice and resolution of incidents.

49. Technical (plus logistical and training) issues were referred to the POL Horizon

Acceptance Forum which met regularly with representatives from Pathway.

50.All high and medium level incidents were addressed with a view to downgrading prior

to an acceptance decision. Incidents, such as screen freezing and printer failures

Page 8 of 13
WITNO04120100
WITNO4120100

were listed for intervention between Pathway and the testing teams. Work towards
resolution was kept under review through documents submitted to POL and joint
forums with Pathway. (Documents WITN0412_01/05; POL00028332 is an example.)

51. Training was a major success criterion for acceptance and continued to generate
concerns despite intensive negotiations with Pathway. | recall a succession of letters
between myself, the Pathway CEO and ultimately at ICL Director level. Concessions
and improvements had been made to the training content itself and on the level of
understanding and motivation at outlets in advance of formal training. Concerns

about the user guides being developed alongside training were addressed.

52. It was recognised that support would be required after an office went live,
particularly while the functionality of the Horizon Support Helpdesk provided by
Pathway was limited. POL made a significant investment in the deployment of its
line management resource to support balancing in particular and also general
aftercare for outlets. Training was provided by Pathway.

53.A series of joint workshops with Pathway was instituted. Agreement was reached on
a level of pre-training — | think at selected outlets where concerns were identified.
Additional content in the training scripts was introduced with additional in-office time
and the entire POL line management resource was to be trained on the Horizon
Field Support Officer course. Pathway were also required to provide training

performance measurement and to share and follow up concerns

54. My understanding of the technical integrity and robustness of Horizon at this point
was necessarily based on the information provided at the various levels of
managerial scrutiny to which I was a party. | understood there were problems,
particularly two high level incidents but that continued interrogation of the system
and the degree of Pathway intervention demanded, meant that solutions were
identified, being developed and could be applied.

55.1 understood there was sufficient evidence that demonstrated the basic operational
integrity of the Pathway solution and that sufficient evidence was emerging from the

Live Trial operation of the capacity of Pathway to respond with technical intervention

Page 9 of 13
WITNO04120100
WITNO4120100

when incidents arose.

56.1 could only reflect the experience of the technical teams and the reports generated
partly because | was not operating in a technical capacity, partly because we
accepted assurances from Pathway, within the contract parameters that outstanding
issues could be resolved within acceptable timescales and would be subject to

satisfactory evidence.

57. By the time roll out was commencing, my role within the programme was limited and
decreasing and a team was in place to manage the physical and logistical aspects
of roll out. My role within the Post Office Horizon team ended towards the end of

1999 and | moved on to other responsibilities.

58. From my perspective and recollection, the main input from end users was through
the working forums set up during trial and early roll out, involving:
- the Heads of Retail Network, who managed the Retail Line structure and had
responsibility for offices in their geographical jurisdiction.
- the management team from the evolving service support centre.

- the Post Office implementation team.

One concern to emerge was the existence of 3 different support centres as the
position was rationalised, so that users faced a complex set of decisions and advice.

59. The main concerns were about problems balancing at the end of the weekly
accounting cycle and the level of support provided to individual outlets as they came

on stream.

60. Throughout the whole period of my involvement with the programme | had frequent
meetings with the NFSP Executive and individual representatives. This was mostly
to keep them abreast of developments and particularly the roll out plan and

timescales.

61.1 can only recall the NFSP position in the early stages of trial and roll out to be
supportive. As the number of offices going live increased, they reported more issues

Page 10 of 13
WITNO04120100
WITNO4120100

being referred to their local representatives. | do not recall them expressing

fundamental concerns about the abilities or robustness of the system.

62. From this perspective, 20+ years later and knowing the history during the
intervening years of the experiences of some Sub Postmasters, it is easy to suggest
some more effective scrutiny might have taken place. Other people will be better
placed to comment. | will have to reinforce the view that the contractual relationship
with Pathway was not supportive of enquiry or intervention — whether on technical

details or in training or logistics.

63. Having read through the extensive cache of documents which | received, my overall
impression is of the intensive work and the comprehensive reporting mechanism
which informed decisions on the viability of the programme. | can only reiterate the
concerns expressed by those closest to the solution of the difficulties of interrogating

the Pathway technical architecture beyond a level of demonstrated functionality.

64. With the benefit of hindsight and the challenging documented stories, this question
almost invites any of us involved in the programme to suggest more might have
been done. However, it would be reasonable to say that the early experience of trial
and the feedback from both the Sub Postmasters themselves and their retail line
managers might have signalled more clearly a concern about underlying problems in

the software system.

65. This would be a more legitimate criticism had there been the access and
opportunity, rather than accepting assurances from Pathway that they were to be
expected in early stages and would be fixed. From my recollection and retrospective
analysis, there were so many competing issues and interests, it is perhaps the voice

of the user which could have been given a greater degree of consideration.

66. Having reread some of the initial documents and the latest batch recently released,
there are some key aspects which have become clearer to me. We did believe in the
validity of the system. It was being launched into a population of widely varying
technical and cultural backgrounds. The amount of time and effort devoted to the

training solution underlines a genuine belief that education, training and support

Page 11 of 13
WITNO04120100
WITNO4120100

were the keys to success and that confidence and ability to interface with the system
_ could be attained for the vast majority of users.

67.We need also to remember that widespread use of mobile phones, laptops and
tablets did not form part of the experience of almost all of the thousands of people
working in the Sub Office estate. It was a quantum leap for many of us. The whole
programme, logistically, was a vast enterprise constructed, with some pride, by the -
POL and Pathway teams, involving pre-installation visits, outlet modifications,
equipment availability and the whole training and support mechanism — all to an
estate which initially incorporated 19,000 outlets and many multiples of operating
positions. The lead in times to these activities could stretch to months and even

years.

68. Stopping and resetting this gigantic process had many implications. ltwas a
leviathan, additionally encumbered by contractual conditions and government

scrutiny.
