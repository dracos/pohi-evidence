shall be amended under the Change Control Procedure, to the extent necessary, to be
consistent with the Solution Baseline (together with any rectification plans and
workarounds agreed pursuant to Schedule B6.3).

Until the date on which Schedules B3.2, B3.3 and B3.4 and all other documents in the
Solution Baseline Documentation Set are amended pursuant to Clause 5.4, Fujitsu
Services’ obligations under this Agreement in relation to the HNG-X System shall be
determined by reference to the Solution Baseline (and any subsequent changes to the
HNG-X System agreed pursuant to the Change Control Procedure) rather than those
Schedules and documents.

Save where the reference to XP is to it as the existing operating system, until such
time as a CCN to introduce a replacement operating system for NT (as envisaged by
paragraph 1.4 of Schedule C3) has been agreed by the Parties, any references to “XP”
in any of the Schedules, CCDs or CRDs, or to “Microsoft”, as the provider of XP, shall
be construed generically to mean a new operating system intended to replace NT and
the provider of that operating system respectively.

At the 18th January 2021, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a
pandemic in relation to the COVID-19 virus (the “Pandemic”). Due to the Pandemic,
national and local governments in the countries where the Fujitsu Services teams are
based have adopted or may in the future, in relation to the Pandemic or other
pandemic or epidemics declared by the World Health Organisation, adopt restrictive
working practices, including but not limited to:

(a) mandating that office workers work from home;

(b) closing certain businesses;

(c) reducing capacity in offices;

(d) implementing social distancing;

(e) reducing or restricting access to public transport; and/or
(f) closure or reduced access to schools,

as may be published by relevant governmental authorities from time to time, in each
case to the extent that they are relevant to the delivery of the Payment and Banking
Service and roll-out of the Payment and Banking Solution to the Post Office branches
in accordance with Appendix 1 (Migration Plan) of Schedule I6 (the “Restrictive
Working Practices”).

The Parties acknowledge the possibility that key personnel of Fujitsu Services engaged
in the delivery of the Payment and Banking Service and roll-out of the Payment and
Banking Solution to the Post Office branches in accordance with Appendix 1 (Migration
Plan) of Schedule 16 and may be unable to perform their duties as a result of them or a
member of their household having the COVID-19 virus or any other virus caused as
part of any other virus which is declared to be a pandemic or epidemic by the World
Health Organisation (“Relevant Iliness”). The Parties therefore agree that any
timelines, Service Levels or other obligations under this Payment and Banking Service
are subject to the following provisions:

(a) During any period during which Restrictive Working Practices are in place (“the
Relevant Period”), Fujitsu Services will use all reasonable endeavours to
mitigate any adverse impact of any Restrictive Working Practices, or Relevant
Illness, on the Payment and Banking Pilot, roll-out of the Payment and Banking
Solution, Service Levels or any other relevant obligations in relation to the
Payment and Banking Service and will implement specific measures to support
this, including enabling employees to work from home where practical. Fujitsu
Services will follow any applicable government guidance in relation to the
specific measures that it implements.

(b)

Fujitsu Services shall, on a monthly basis (or more frequently where Post
Office deems it necessary to remedy an immediate or ongoing impact to the
Payment and Banking Services) as part of the Payment and Banking Service
review meetings, provide an update on any relevant new Restrictive Working
Practices introduced since the prior project review meeting and an update on
any potential impact of any Restrictive Working Practices, or any Relevant
Iliness, on the delivery of the Payment and Banking Service and roll-out of the
Payment and Banking Solution and, such updates to be recorded in the

Except as explicitly stated herein, nothing in this Agreement shall transfer ownership of
or grant licences (including rights under patents) of any pre-existing or independently
developed Intellectual Property Rights of either Party.

Where Post Office Foreground IPR or Licensed IPR subsists in software within Fujitsu
Services or its Sub-contractors’ possession or control, Fujitsu Services shall, at the
request of Post Office, provide Post Office with one up-to-date copy (and other copies
as may reasonably be requested) of that software (in both Source Code and object
code formats) and all related engineering, design and test data, configuration files and
programming notes.

In the event that Fujitsu Services, a member of the Fujitsu Services Group or its HNG-
X Sub-contractor, transfers or assigns any Licensed IPR or Fujitsu Background IPR
used for the purposes of performing the Services to any third party, Fujitsu Services
shall ensure that such assignment or transfer is subject to the licences granted
hereunder and shall notify Post Office of such transfer or assignment as soon as
reasonably practicable.

Each Party undertakes (at no additional charge) to do all such things and execute all
such documents as may be reasonably required to give full effect to any assignment or
licence made or granted hereunder of, in the case of Fujitsu Services, Post Office
Foreground IPR, Licensed IPR or Fujitsu Background IPR and, in the case of Post
Office, Intellectual Property Rights in Post Office Background Materials.

Capabilities and Support Facilities, and the receipt of the Services in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall not infringe any
Intellectual Property Rights of any third party (other than any infringement that
is subject to any indemnity given by Post Office pursuant to Clause 34.3). For
the avoidance of doubt, this shall not apply to the Post Office’s receipt of
Microsoft Azure Services to the extent such services are provided by Microsoft
to Post Office pursuant to the Customer Agreement or to any services provided
by any third party in respect of provision of the Post Office Cloud; and

IPR owned by Third Parties

Post Office acknowledges and agrees that all Intellectual Property Rights in Horizon
Third Party Software and Third Party Items (excluding Intellectual Property Rights in
Third Party Items required to be assigned to Post Office pursuant to Clause 29) shall
remain vested in the relevant third party proprietor of those rights.

In consideration of the payment of the relevant Charges:

30.6.1 subject to Clauses 30.11 and 30.12, Fujitsu Services hereby grants or shall
grant, as the case may be, to Post Office a perpetual (subject to Clause 30.6.3),
royalty-free, irrevocable and non-exclusive sub-licence:

(a) to Use Horizon Third Party Software and HNG-X Third Party Software;
and

(b) to use Third Party Items (other than HNG-X Third Party Software);

in each case where Fujitsu Services has procured the rights to grant such sub-
licences; or

30.6.2 subject to Clause 30.11, if Fujitsu Services is unable to procure the right to
grant the sub-licence referred to in Clause 30.6.1, having used all reasonable
endeavours to procure such right, Fujitsu Services shall procure that the
relevant third party grants to Post Office a royalty-free and non-exclusive
licence:

(a) to Use Horizon Third Party Software and HNG-X Third Party Software;
and

(b) to use Third Party Items (other than HNG-X Third Party Software),

and shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that such licence is
perpetual (subject to Clause 30.6.3) and irrevocable.

30.6.3 Each of the sub-licences and/or licences granted or procured pursuant to this
Clause 30.6 in respect of Horizon Third Party Software shall terminate upon the
later of:

(a) the occurrence of Trigger Point T6 (Counter Application Rollout
Complete); and

Agreement or, in the case only of “Windows NT Workstation” (identified
as Horizon Third Party Software in Schedule B4.1), the date when that
software is no longer used in the provision or receipt of the HNG-X
Services in accordance with this Agreement.

Each of Post Office's sub-licences and licences under Clauses 30.6.1 and 30.6.2
respectively shall be subject to any additional terms and conditions imposed by the
licensor, provided that any terms of any such sub-licence or licence shall not detract
from the rights granted to Post Office hereunder. Without prejudice to the generality of
the foregoing, Post Office accepts the licence terms relating to the Escher Upgrade
Software set out in Schedule B4.1 and that such terms satisfy the requirements of this
Clause 30.7,

Fujitsu Services shall use all reasonable endeavours to enable a third party engaged by
Post Office to use Horizon Third Party Software subject to and in accordance with this
Agreement on behalf of Post Office provided that such third party shall have entered
into an appropriate Agreed Form NDA.

Post Office shall be entitled to copy Horizon Third Party Software and HNG-X Third
Party Software in order to create as many archival or back-up copies of the same as
are necessary. When copying such software, Post Office shall include the original
machine readable copyright notice, and a label affixed to the media identifying the
software and stating: "This medium contains an authorised copy of copyrighted
software which is the property of [the Third Party Software Owner]."

In respect of any Non-standard Third Party Material to be (i) included in or used as part
of the HNG-X Service Infrastructure or the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities,
or (ii) used to provide or receive the HNG-X Services over the HNG-X Service
Infrastructure, Fujitsu Services shall procure such rights for Post Office to use those
materials as are set out in Clause 48.8, such rights only to be granted in accordance
with the provisions of Clause 48.8 (in each case as if references to Fujitsu Background
IPR were to the IPR in the Non-standard Third Party Material). Without prejudice to
Post Office's rights and remedies under this Agreement, in the event that Fujitsu
Services cannot procure such rights, it shall not procure the development or make use
of that Non-standard Third Party Material in connection with this Agreement without the
prior written consent of Post Office and shall, at Post Office's request and at no
additional charge to Post Office:

30.10.1 provide Post Office with such information as it may reasonably request in order
to understand and assess the reasons for, and the benefits of, the use of that
Non-standard Third Party Material (including, without limitation, identifying any
alternative software or materials which possess substantially equivalent
functionality, performance and interoperability to that of the Non-standard Third
Party Material and in relation to which the above rights can be obtained with
minimum additional costs or restrictions); and

Post Office acknowledges and agrees that Fujitsu Services may be unable and, if so,
shall not be obliged to fulfil its obligations pursuant to Clauses 30.6.1, 30.6.2 or 30.17
(as the case may be) in respect of an item of Horizon Third Party Software or a Third
Party Item in the event that an act or omission of Post Office gives rise to a right for the
proprietor of the relevant item of Horizon Third Party Software or Third Party Item to:

30.11.1 terminate its licence to Fujitsu Services of the relevant item of Horizon Third
Party Software or Third Party Item;

30.11.2 terminate its licence to Post Office of the relevant Horizon Third Party Software
or Third Party Item; or

30.11.3 require Fujitsu Services to terminate its sub-licence to Post Office of the
relevant Horizon Third Party Software or Third Party Item.

In the event that Post Office is in breach of a sub-licence of an item of Horizon Third
Party Software or a Third Party Item granted pursuant to Clause 30.6.1 and Fujitsu
Services reasonably believes that Post Office's breach will result in the termination of
Fujitsu Services’ right to use such Third Party Item:

30.12.1 Fujitsu Services shall give Post Office notice in writing specifying the breach
and requiring Post Office to remedy that breach within 30 days of receipt of
such notice; and

30.12.2 if Post Office fails to remedy the breach within 30 days of receipt of such
notice, Fujitsu Services may by notice in writing terminate the relevant sub-
licence.

In the event that a sub-licence is terminated pursuant to Clauses 30.11 or 30.12.2,
Fujitsu Services shall not be liable for any failure or delay in providing any Service to
the extent that the failure or delay is caused by the cessation of Post Office’s right to
use the material or thing the subject of that sub-licence, provided that Fujitsu Services
has used its reasonable endeavours to continue providing the affected Service or
Services to the extent possible and to mitigate the impact of the failure or delay.
Fujitsu Services shall provide such assistance as Post Office may reasonably require in
order for Post Office to assess, and procure the necessary rights to use, suitable
replacement materials to those the subject of the terminated licence.

Subject to any necessary consents (which Fujitsu Services shall use all reasonable
endeavours to obtain) in relation to Horizon Third Party Software, HNG-X Third Party
Software or other materials or things in which the Intellectual Property Rights are
owned by a third party, any licence or sub-licence granted by Fujitsu Services to Post
Office hereunder:

30.14.1 shall be transferable in accordance with the provisions of Clause 58.3; and

30.15 Use of Internal Design Documentation and Specially Commissioned Design
Documentation

30.15.1 Subject to Clause 30.15.2, Post Office and a third party engaged by Post Office
including but not limited to any bona fide potential Next Suppliers (in particular during
any tender, due diligence or implementation process) where reasonably required (i) to
comply with the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (in particular without limitation
Regulation 4(3)) and (ii) by Post Office for a Design Purpose, shall be entitled to have
access to and use Horizon Design Documentation.

30.15.2 Post Office agrees:

(a) that (irrespective of ownership of the Intellectual Property Rights in Developed
Documentation) it will not use or permit to be used any Horizon Design
Documentation for any purpose other than a Design Purpose;

(b) not to disclose Horizon Design Documentation to any third party save where
such disclosure is required for a Design Purpose and the third party to whom it
is disclosed has (1) entered into such confidentiality commitments as Fujitsu
Services may reasonably request (written confirmation of which shall be
provided by Post Office to Fujitsu Services prior to release of such
documentation), and (2) delivered a written undertaking to Fujitsu Services that
it will use such Horizon Design Documentation solely for the Design Purposes;
and

(c) access to and use of any Horizon Design Documentation in accordance with
this Clause 30.15.2 shall not serve to transfer any Intellectual Property Rights in
the documentation or information contained therein to the Post Office or any
third party.

30.15.3 For the purposes of determining ownership of, and any licences granted in respect of,
Intellectual Property Rights in any Specially Commissioned Design Documentation,
such documentation shall be deemed to fall within the definition of Developed
Documentation or Specially Written Documentation, whichever is applicable. Licences
granted by Fujitsu Services under Clause 30.1 in respect such Specially Commissioned
Design Documentation that is deemed to be Fujitsu Developed Documentation shall be
subject to the additional restrictions imposed by Clause 30.15.2.

Deposited Software

30.16 Fujitsu Services shall place the Source Code of the Deposited Software in escrow with
a reputable escrow company agreed upon by the Parties (if the Parties are unable to
agree then the escrow company shall be NCC), on the basis of the appropriate

agreement, a "Source Code Escrow Agreement") such terms, unless the parties agree
and record otherwise in their Source Code Escrow Agreement, to be consistent with
Post Office's rights under Clauses 48.7 to 48.13.

Without prejudice to the generality of Clauses 48.7 to 48.13, Fujitsu Services hereby
grants to Post Office a perpetual, royalty-free and non-exclusive licence (which shall
(subject to Clause 30.11) be irrevocable) to Use, reproduce, modify, adapt and
enhance (and to authorise a third party to Use, reproduce, modify, adapt and enhance)
the Source Code version of the Deposited Software. However, the foregoing licence
shall only become effective if Post Office becomes entitled to obtain access to the
Source Code version of the Deposited Software pursuant to the Source Code Escrow
Agreement referred to in Clause 30.16 and the licence shall be subject to any
restrictions contained herein in respect of the object code version of the Deposited
Software.

Miscellaneous Licence Provisions

30.18.1. On the sale or transfer of an item of Hardware of which Internal Code is an integral

part, the licence to use such Internal Code in combination with the said item of
Hardware shall pass to the purchaser or other transferee of the said item of Hardware.
Post Office shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the purchaser or transferee of
the said item of Hardware agrees to comply with the licence to use the Internal Code
that was previously enjoyed by Post Office.

30.18.2The licence to use Listed Documentation granted under this Clause 30 does not

authorise any use or disclosure of the Listed Documentation in question which would
constitute a breach of the obligations of confidentiality contained in Clause 61 or any
other obligations of confidentiality which have been accepted by Post Office.

30.18.3 Notwithstanding and without prejudice to 30.11 above and any other relevant provisions

(b) such relevant materials and information that it is reasonable for Fujitsu
Services to provide in order for Post Office to understand and assess
such risk and the alternative requirement proposed by Fujitsu Services
under paragraph 34.5.1(a);

within 14 days of its receipt of such notice (or such other time as the Parties
may agree), Post Office shall respond in writing to Fujitsu Services stating
whether or not it:

(a) agrees with Fujitsu Services’ concerns; and/or

(b) either (a) instructs Fujitsu Services to continue with the development
cycle in respect of that Queried Requirement in any event, in which case
Post Office shall indemnify Fujitsu Services under Clause 34.3.3, or (b)
instructs Fujitsu Services to implement the alternative requirement
proposed under Clause 34.5.1(a) in which case such alternative
requirement shall form part of the Requirements Baseline;

in the event that Post Office instructs Fujitsu Services to implement the
alternative requirement in accordance with Clause 34.5.2(b)(b), Fujitsu
Services shall not be able to invoke the process set out in this Clause 34.5 in
respect of that alternative requirement at any time after Post Office so instructs
Fujitsu Services;

at all times during the process set out in this Clause 34.5, Fujitsu Services shall
provide Post Office with such assistance as Post Office may reasonably require
in order to understand and assess the risk notified to it and the alternative
requirement proposed by Fujitsu Services, provided that the Parties hereby
acknowledge that each Party shall be responsible for forming its own
assessment of such risk and alternative requirement;

either Party may request, at any time prior to an instruction being given under
Clause 34.5.2(b), that the Parties meet to discuss a risk notified, or an
alternative requirement proposed, to Post Office by Fujitsu Services in
accordance with this Clause and to agree in good faith a course of action which
is mutually beneficial to the Parties. If the Parties are unable to agree on the
relevant risk and either Post Office does not give Fujitsu Services an instruction
under Clause 34.5.2(b) and/or the Parties are unable to agree the suitability of
the alternative requirement proposed, then the matter shall be escalated in
accordance with the DRP set out in Annex 2 of Schedule A2 (Governance), up
to and including the stage set out at paragraph 3 of such Annex (Executive
Review), provided that references in that Annex to “five Working Days” shall be
read as “two Working Days” for the purposes of this Clause;

if, following the earlier of (i) the escalation of the matter and completion of the
process set out in Clause 34.5.5; or (ii) the date falling ten Working Days after

the date upon which the matter was first escalated in accordance with Clause
34.5.5, the Parties are not able to agree on the risk or the suitability of the
alternative requirement proposed and Post Office fails to instruct Fujitsu
Services to continue with the development cycle in respect of that Queried
Requirement, then Fujitsu Services shall:

(a) be entitled to reject that Queried Requirement (such rejected Queried
Requirement being a "Rejected Requirement"), provided that in the
event that Fujitsu Services disagrees with any advice and guidance of a
Facilitator obtained as part of the escalation process, it shall provide Post
Office with a reasonably detailed statement of its reasons for doing so;
and

(b) achieve the relevant Development Obligation for such Rejected
Requirement; and

34.8.7 in the event that Fujitsu Services rejects a Queried Requirement pursuant to
this Clause 34.5 and Fujitsu Services would, if it had complied with Clause
34.4, have known about the risk relating to that Rejected Requirement earlier
than the date on which it actually became aware of that risk and notified the
Post Office pursuant to Clause 34.5.1, then Fujitsu Services shall refund to
Post Office any Charges paid or payable by Post Office in respect of
development work undertaken by or on behalf of Fujitsu Services in relation to
that Rejected Requirement in that intervening period (but excluding any
Charges in respect of development work which Fujitsu Services is able to
demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of Post Office is of continued use
and benefit to Post Office).

The indemnities set out at Clause 34.3.1 shall not apply to any UI Development
Requirement to the extent that (a) Fujitsu Services or a member of the Fujitsu Services
Group was engaged by Post Office for the purposes of the development of that UI
Development Requirement and contributed to that Ul Development Requirement and
(b) such contribution resulted in the infringement or alleged infringement referred to in
Clause 34.3.1.

In the event that, pursuant to Clause 34.5, Fujitsu Services rejects a Queried
Requirement in respect of which (a) Fujitsu Services or a member of the Fujitsu
Services Group was engaged by Post Office for the purposes of the development of
such Queried Requirement and (b) contributed towards such Queried Requirement,
then (without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to Post Office) Fujitsu
Services shall refund to Post Office the Charges paid or payable by Post Office in
respect of that contribution.

The Party giving an indemnity under this Clause 34 (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall, at
its Own expense, conduct any litigation arising therefrom and all negotiations in
connection therewith and the Party receiving the indemnity (the “Indemnified Party”)
hereby agrees to grant to the Indemnifying Party exclusive control of any such litigation
and such negotiations in relation to the indemnified infringement or alleged
infringement. The Indemnifying Party shall consult with and pay due regard to the
interests (including, where the Post Office is the Indemnified Party, the commercial
interests of the Royal Mail Group and the public interest and where Fujitsu Services is
the Indemnified Party the commercial interests of the Fujitsu Services Group) and
views of the Indemnified Party in the conduct of any defence to any claim or demand
hereunder, and shall, where it is reasonable to do so taking into account also the
interests of the Indemnifying Party, comply with such interests and views.

The Indemnified Party shall, at the request of the Indemnifying Party, afford to the
Indemnifying Party all reasonable assistance for the purpose of contesting any claim or
demand made or action brought against the Indemnified Party to which the indemnity
may apply or any claim or demand made or action brought against the Indemnifying
Party to which the indemnity may apply. The Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party for all reasonable costs and expenses (including but not limited to
legal costs and disbursements on a solicitor and client basis) incurred in so doing.

The Indemnified Party shall not make any admissions which may be prejudicial to the
defence or settlement of any claim, demand or action for infringement or alleged
infringement brought against the Indemnified Party to which the indemnity may apply or
any claim or demand made or action brought against the Indemnifying Party to which
the indemnity may apply.

If a claim or demand is made or action brought to which the indemnity may apply or in
the reasonable opinion of the Indemnifying Party is likely to be made or brought, the
Indemnifying Party may at its own expense either:

34.15.1 modify any or all of the affected documents, software, materials, items or other
things whatsoever without reducing the performance and functionality of the
same, or substitute alternative items, products or services of equivalent
performance and functionality for any or all of the documents, software,
materials, items or other things whatsoever, so as to avoid the infringement or
the alleged infringement but without disrupting the performance of the
Services, provided that the terms herein shall apply mutatis mutandis to such
modified or substituted items or services and such modified or substituted
items shall be acceptable to the Indemnified Party (whether by passing any
form of acceptance testing or otherwise), such acceptance not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, and shall reimburse the Indemnified Party all
reasonable costs directly incurred by it; or

34.15.2 procure a licence to use the affected documents, software, materials, items or
other things whatsoever on terms which afford to the Indemnified Party no
more extensive rights than those originally applicable hereunder and which are
acceptable to the Indemnified Party and shall reimburse the Indemnified Party
all reasonable costs directly incurred by it.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Clause 34:

34.16.1 to the extent that any actual or alleged infringement, to which this Clause 34
applies, relates to the development by Fujitsu Services under this Agreement of
the HNG-X Service Infrastructure or the Business Capabilities and Support
Facilities and does not result from (i) a breach by Fujitsu Services of the Clean
Room Rules or paragraph 4.2 of Annex 2 to Schedule B6.2 (ii) a failure by
Fujitsu Services to comply with Clause 15.1.5, or (iii) a breach by Fujitsu
Services of Clause 34.4; and

34.16.2 provided that the HNG-X Development Completion has not occurred at the
time of the claim, demand or action in respect of such infringement,

the costs of undertaking any modification or substitution or procuring a licence that may
be made or obtained pursuant to Clause 34.12 shall be treated as a normal cost of
development and Post Office shall pay Fujitsu Services:

(a) for such modification work on a time cost basis, subject to and in
accordance with the provisions of Schedule D8; and

(b) in respect of any such substitution or licence, an amount equivalent to
Fujitsu Services' cost of the product used as a substitute and/or of the
necessary licence, multiplied by 95 and divided by 100.

The indemnities set out in this Clause 34 (other than where Clause 34.3.1(b) applies)
shall not apply insofar as any such claim or demand or action is in respect of:

34.17.1 any use by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party of the affected documents,
software, materials, items or other things whatsoever in combination with any
item not supplied or approved (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) by the Indemnifying Party where such combined use directly gives
tise to the claim, demand or action; or

34.17.2 any modification carried out by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party to any
item supplied by the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement if such
modification is not authorised by the Indemnifying Party in writing; or

34.17.3any use by the Indemnified Party of the affected documents, software,
materials, items or other things whatsoever in a manner not reasonably to be
inferred from their specification (if any) or the requirements of the Indemnified
Party (including, without limitation, where Post Office is the Indemnified Party,
the Requirements Baseline).

If the Indemnifying Party has availed itself of its rights to modify the affected
documents, software, materials, items or other things whatsoever or to supply
substitute products or services pursuant to Clause 34.12.1 or to procure a licence under
Clause 34.12.2 and such exercise of the said rights has avoided any claim, demand or
action for infringement or alleged infringement, or if the Indemnified Party has
unreasonably withheld its acceptance of any items modified or substituted by the

case may be) shall apply.

reasonable efforts to mitigate the consequences of the relevant Post Office failure or
delay in the performance of its obligations, and to continue to provide the Payment and

Services shall not be entitled to any relief, to the extent that Fujitsu Services cannot
demonstrate to Post Office's reasonable satisfaction that:

Service Levels is a direct result of a Post Office Cause, or a Tower
Contractor Cause (identifying the specific Post Office Obligation or Tower
Contractor Responsibility that has not been met);

39A.3.2 Fujitsu Services made all reasonable efforts to mitigate the consequences of
the relevant Post Office Cause or Tower Contractor Cause, and to continue to
provide the Services in accordance with the Service Levels; and

Service Levels arose from a cause beyond Fujitsu Services’ reasonable
control.

Post Office will consider any submission under Clause 39A.3 and advise Fujitsu
Services of its proposal in respect of a submission promptly and in any event within 15

Cause or Tower Contractor Cause will not be included in measuring the
performance of any affected Service;

39A.5.2 Fujitsu Services will not be treated as being in breach of this Agreement to
the extent that non-performance or breach is due to the Post Office Cause or
Tower Contractor Cause; and

affected by Post Office Cause or Tower Contractor Cause as if it had not
occurred provided that Fujitsu Services mitigates those Charges to the extent

Costs incurred due to Post Office Cause or Tower Contractor Cause

In this Clause 39B, claims for reimbursement of additional costs and expenses may be
claimed insofar as the Parties have not agreed to recompense Fujitsu Services
elsewhere in this Agreement. Where the Parties have agreed to recompense Fujitsu
Services elsewhere in this Agreement, Fujitsu Services may not make any claim under
this Clause 39B.

If Fujitsu Services reasonably believes that it has incurred additional costs and
expenses as a direct result of steps taken by Fujitsu Services in carrying out any
additional work or services to remedy or mitigate an issue caused by a Post Office
Cause or Tower Contractor Cause, then Fujitsu Services shall claim for reimbursement
of those additional costs and in accordance with the claim process set out in Clause
39B.3.

To the extent that Fujitsu Services reasonably believes that Clause 39B.2 applies,
Fujitsu Services may make a written submission to Post Office within 3 months of the
commencement of the Post Office Cause or Tower Contractor Cause seeking
reimbursement of additional costs and expenses necessarily and reasonably incurred
as a direct result of steps taken by Fujitsu Services in carrying out any additional work
or services to remedy or mitigate an issue caused by a Post Office Cause or Tower
Contractor Cause. Fujitsu Services shall not be entitled to any additional costs and
expenses, unless Fujitsu Services can demonstrate to Post Office’s reasonable
satisfaction that:

39B.3.1 Fujitsu Services could not have avoided the effect on the provision of the
Services and/or on its ability to perform its obligations under the Agreement
by using all reasonable endeavours to eliminate or mitigate the consequences
of the delay in accordance with Good Industry Practice and having regard to
the scope of the Services for which Fujitsu Services is responsible; and

39B.3.2 costs incurred were reasonable, demonstrable, necessarily and reasonably
incurred and that Fujitsu Services used all reasonable endeavours to
minimise such costs,

and Fujitsu Services will provide any additional information that Post Office may
reasonably require in order to assess the validity of Fujitsu Services’ claim.

Post Office will consider any submission under Clause 39B.3 and advise Fujitsu
Services of its proposal in respect of a submission promptly and in any event within 15
Working Days of receipt. If Fujitsu Services does not accept Post Office’s submission,

Tower Contractors to the meeting and in that event shall inform the other Party.

The agreed costs will be shown as an additional amount on the next Operational

invoice is due to be issued then Fujitsu Services will issue an invoice.

In the event of a dispute, either Party may refer the matter for resolution in accordance
with schedule A2 and, failing resolution through governance within 15 Working Days,
such Party may refer the dispute for resolution in accordance with the Dispute
Resolution Procedure. Pending the resolution of the Dispute both Parties will continue

Fujitsu Services acknowledges that in respect of a Post Office Cause or a Tower
Contractor Cause, a materiality threshold applies in respect of costs claimed for
reimbursement pursuant to Clause 39B.3 and that Fujitsu Services will not be entitled
to claim for reimbursement of costs pursuant to that Clause unless and until additional
costs and expenses incurred by Fujitsu Services in consequence of the circumstances
listed in Clause 39B.2 in respect of each individual Post Office Cause or of each
individual Tower Contractor Cause exceed £5,000.

Effects of a Fujitsu Dependency Failure

For the avoidance of doubt, prior to the earlier of notification to Fujitsu Services of the
appointment of the Post Office Service Integrator by Post Office or the termination of
any Terminable Service and the contracting of a replacement for said service by Post
Office with a Tower Contractor under its Towers Model, there shall be no Fujitsu
Dependencies.

Upon agreement of any Fujitsu Dependencies, Fujitsu Services undertakes to notify
Post Office as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware that it has not, will
not, or is unlikely to fulfil any Fujitsu Services Dependency or will be delayed from
doing so (a “Fujitsu Dependency Failure”). In the event that Post Office has not
been notified by Fujitsu Services in accordance with this Clause 39C.2 but Post Office
is aware or becomes aware of a Fujitsu Dependency Failure, then Post Office shall
notify Fujitsu Services of such Fujitsu Dependency Failure.

Notwithstanding actions to be taken under any Incident management process to resolve
a Fujitsu Dependency Failure, within 5 Working Days after providing notice or receiving
notice under Clause 39C.2, Fujitsu Services shall submit a report relating to the Fujitsu
Dependency Failure (the “Fujitsu Dependency Failure Report”) to Post Office
setting out full details of the reasons for, the issues arising out of and the steps which
Fujitsu Services is taking to minimise the impact of the Fujitsu Dependency Failure on
Post Office and/or the Tower Contractors to the extent to which the potential impact of
a particular Fujitsu Dependency Failure was agreed as part of the agreement of the
particular Fujitsu Dependency. In addition, it shall notify Post Office of the actions it

Agreement and use its reasonable endeavours to take precautions which it ought
reasonably to have taken in accordance with Good Professional Practice in order to
avoid or mitigate the potential impacts of the Fujitsu Dependency Failure on Post
Office, and/or the relevant Tower Contractors.

Fujitsu Services shall co-operate and work with Post Office, the Tower Contractors
and/or any third parties (as reasonably directed by Post Office) to mitigate the Fujitsu
Dependency Failure.

In the event of a Post Office Cause or Tower Contractor Cause, Fujitsu Services shall
co-operate, support, collaborate and work with Post Office, other Tower Contractors
and/or any third parties (as reasonably directed by Post Office) so that Post Office
and/or relevant Tower Contractors are able to mitigate the effect of the Post Office
Cause or Tower Contractor Cause.

Once a Fujitsu Dependency Failure has been resolved and in any event no later than
30 days (or such period as may be agreed by the Parties) after the occurrence of the
Fujitsu Dependency Failure, the Subject Leads for the Relationship best qualified to
deal with the Fujitsu Dependency Failure, taking into account its nature and the
responsibilities of each Subject Lead, shall convene an occasional meeting of the
relevant Relationship in accordance with paragraph 3.3 of Schedule A2 to agree
responsibility for the Fujitsu Dependency Failure (including where appropriate the
preparation of a root cause analysis).

Post Office may make a written request to Fujitsu Services seeking reimbursement of
demonstrable additional costs and expenses necessarily and reasonably incurred as a
direct result of steps taken by Post Office and/or a Tower Contractor in carrying out any
additional work or services to remedy or mitigate an issue caused by a Fujitsu
Dependency Failure (the “Compensation Amount”). Post Office shall make any
claim for a Compensation Amount within 3 months of commencement of the Fujitsu
Dependency Failure. Post Office shall not be entitled to any Compensation Amount for
itself or any Tower Contractor unless Post Office can demonstrate to Fujitsu Services’
reasonable satisfaction that:

39C.8.1 Post Office and/or the Tower Contractor could not have avoided the effect on
the provision or receipt of the relevant services and/or on its ability to perform
its obligations under its agreement(s) by using all reasonable endeavours to
eliminate or mitigate the consequences of the delay in accordance with Good
Industry Practice; and

39C.8.2 costs incurred were reasonable, demonstrable, necessarily and reasonably
incurred and that Post Office and/or the Tower Contractor used all reasonable
endeavours to minimise such costs,

and Post Office will provide any additional information that Fujitsu Services may
reasonably require in order to assess the validity of Post Office’s request.

39C.9 Fujitsu Services will consider any request under Clause 39C.8 and advise Post Office of

its proposal in respect of the Compensation Amount promptly and in any event within
15 Working Days of receipt. If Post Office does not accept Fujitsu Services’ proposal,
the Parties shall meet within 5 Working Days of Post Office’s receipt of Fujitsu
Services’ proposal and shall use reasonable endeavours to agree the Compensation
Amount applicable. Either Party may invite other interested Tower Contractors to the
meeting and in that event shall inform the other Party.

39C.10 The agreed Compensation Amount will be shown as a credit on the next Operational

Charges invoice due to be issued under this Agreement. If no Operational Charges
invoice is due to be issued then Post Office will issue a credit note.

39C.11 In the event of a dispute under this Clause 39C, either Party may refer the matter for

resolution in accordance with Schedule A2 and, failing resolution through governance
within 15 Working Days, such Party may refer the dispute for resolution in accordance
with the Dispute Resolution Procedure. Pending the resolution of the Dispute both
Parties will continue to resolve the causes of, and mitigate the effects of such failure.

39C.12 Post Office acknowledges that in respect of a Fujitsu Dependency Failure, a materiality

costs and expenses incurred by Post Office and/or any other Tower Contractor in
consequence of the circumstances listed in Clause 39C.8 in respect of each individual
Fujitsu Dependency Failure exceed £5,000.

Fujitsu Services' Personnel

Post Office reserves the right under this Agreement to refuse to admit to any premises
occupied by or on behalf of any member of the Royal Mail Group (which expression
shall in this Clause 40 include all persons employed or engaged by the Royal Mail
Group and all persons other than Fujitsu Services and its sub-contractors providing
services to the Royal Mail Group), or to any Branch any person employed or engaged
by Fujitsu Services, or by a sub-contractor, whose admission would be, in the
reasonable opinion of Post Office, undesirable.

If and when directed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services shall provide a list of the names
and addresses of all persons who it is expected may require admission in connection
with the performance of this Agreement to any premises occupied by or on behalf any
member of the Royal Mail Group or to any Branch, specifying the capacities in which
they are concerned with this Agreement and giving such other particulars as Post
Office may reasonably require. Fujitsu Services shall comply with any reasonable
directions issued by the designated representative of Post Office as to which persons
may be admitted to such premises and at what times.

that he understands that the Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989 apply to him both
during the term of and after the expiry or termination of this Agreement.

Fujitsu Services' representatives, engaged within the boundaries of a Royal Mail Group
establishment or Branch, shall comply with such rules, regulations and requirements
(including those relating to security arrangements) as may be in force from time to time
for the conduct of personnel when at that establishment or Branch and when outside
that establishment or Branch.

The decision of Post Office as to whether any person is to be refused admission to any
premises occupied by or on behalf of the Royal Mail Group or to a Branch shall be final
and conclusive.

Fujitsu Services’ Key Personnel

The Parties acknowledge that the Key Personnel are essential to the fulfilment of
Fujitsu Services’ obligations hereunder.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Clause 61, Post Office shall keep the CCD
entitled “Fujitsu Services Key Personnel” (HR/CON/001) (including any proposed or
agreed amendments to it) and the information contained in it (“Personnel Information”)
confidential. Except as provided for in this Clause 41.2, Post Office shall not copy,
reproduce or disclose Personnel Information to any third party.

41.5.1 Post Office may reproduce, copy and disclose Personnel Information:

(a) to Post Office's Subject Leads for (i) the Systems Integration Partnership
and Executive Relationship and (ii) the Commercial Relationship;

(b) to its professional advisers provided such reproduction, copying and
disclosure is necessary for the purposes of this Agreement; or

(c) as required by law,

provided that Post Office shall procure that the persons referred to in
paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall not themselves disclose Personnel
Information (except amongst themselves) without the express written consent
of Fujitsu Services.

41.5.2 Post Office may discuss Personnel Information with and disclose Personnel
Information to FS Listed Personnel.

Fujitsu Services undertakes to use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Key
Personnel are not removed or replaced for the duration of the activities relevant to
them (described as “Tasks” in the CCD entitled “Fujitsu Services Key Personnel”
(HR/CON/001)). However, in the event that any of the Key Personnel become

notice in writing (or such shorter period of notice as may be reasonably practicable) to
Post Office to replace such an individual with another individual whose abilities and
qualifications are appropriate for the services to be performed by such individual.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that in order for Fujitsu Services to successfully
complete its obligations under this Agreement, additional key personnel may be
identified after the date of this Agreement. The Parties shall identify and agree any
such additional key personnel (together with any activities which are relevant to them).

Injury to Persons; Loss of Property

Subject always to Post Office's proper observance of its obligations under this
Clause 42 and except where paragraphs 5.2 or 6.3.3 of Schedule B1.3 apply, Fujitsu
Services shall fully indemnify Post Office in respect of any personal injury or loss of or
damage to Property incurred by Post Office, its contractors or their respective
employees and authorised agents to the extent that such personal injury or loss of
Property is caused by any Default of Fujitsu Services, its employees or agents in
connection with the performance or purported performance of this Agreement.

In the event of any claim or demand being made or action brought to which
Clause 42.1 applies, Fujitsu Services shall be promptly notified thereof and Fujitsu
Services shall at its own expense conduct all negotiations for settlement of the same
and any legal proceedings that may arise therefrom. Fujitsu Services shall consult with
and pay due regard to the interests and views of Post Office (including the commercial
interests of the Royal Mail Group and the public interest) in the conduct of any defence
to any claim or demand hereunder, and shall, where it is reasonable to do so, comply
with such interests and views. Post Office, its employees and agents, shall at the
request of Fujitsu Services afford all reasonable assistance for the purpose of
contesting any such claim or demand or action and shall be repaid any reasonable
expense incurred in so doing and shall not make any admissions which may be
prejudicial to the defence of such claim or demand or action.

Notwithstanding Clause 42.2, Post Office shall have the option to take over the conduct
over any claim, demand or action to which this Clause applies. Should Post Office
exercise the aforementioned option it shall indemnify Fujitsu Services against any loss,
damage, cost or expense which it incurs in respect of that claim, demand or action over
and above the monetary amount (which Fujitsu Services shall have notified to Post
Office prior to Post Office exercising its option) at which Fujitsu Services was prepared
to settle said claim, demand or action.

Liability

Subject to the remaining sub-clauses of this Clause 43, Fujitsu Services shall be liable
for all losses and shall indemnify Post Office against all costs, expenses, losses and
damages incurred, including any legal costs (together referred to in this Clause 43 only

Any such liability shall count as part of Fujitsu Services' aggregate liability

Subject to Clause 44.1 and to the extent permitted at law, the aggregate liability of
Fujitsu Services under Clauses 16 and 43 of this Agreement for the fraud or other
criminal activities of its employees or subcontractors shall be limited to £21,896,142
per Fraud Event.

Subject to Clauses 44.4A, 44.4B and 44.5, the financial limits specified in
Clause 44.2.2 and 44.2.3 shall apply to, and limit the Parties' respective liability for, the
aggregate of all claims for monetary relief arising in the period in question which either
Party may have against the other either under this Agreement, in tort (including
negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise in relation to the subject matter of
this Agreement, including, without limitation, all claims arising for Defaults, all claims
for liquidated damages and Post Office Additional Cost pursuant to Clause 18,
Schedule C1 and/or the provisions of the Service Descriptions, all claims to be
indemnified pursuant to Clauses 34, 42 or 43 and all other claims or costs which are
compensatable in money or money's worth as though all such claims for monetary
relief represented liability for Defaults occurring in the period in question.

For the purposes of Clauses 44.2 and 44.4,

a liability or claim for monetary relief arises when the act, omission, event or
circumstance giving rise to that liability or claim occurs; and

Notwithstanding that Clause 44.2 is stated to be subject to Clause 44.4, Clause 44.4
shall not limit:

44.4B.1 liability of the type referred to in Clauses 44.1;
44.4B.2 _ liability for Defaults governed by 44.2.1, 44.2.4 or 44.2.5; or
44.4B.3 liability governed by Clause 44.3.

The financial limits on the liability of Post Office under Clause 44.2 shall be exclusive
of and additional to any liability of Post Office to pay any Charges, other amounts, the
Transfer Payment, the Termination Charge, any Partial Termination Charge or the
HNG-X Termination Charge which may become properly due and payable to Fujitsu
Services in accordance with the provisions hereof or any sum by way of interest
thereon that a court may award.

Subject always to Clause 44.1, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party
for indirect or consequential loss or damage. However:

(a) Fujitsu Services acknowledges and agrees that it shall not be entitled to
claim that a loss incurred by a Tower Contractor is an indirect loss
solely because it was not incurred by the Post Office. As such, any
loss incurred by a Tower Contractor that would have been a direct loss
if it had been incurred by the Post Office shall, for the purposes of

and

(b) Post Office acknowledges and agrees that all claims that Fujitsu
Services may make for relief under Clause 39A.3 or Clause 39A.5.3
and for compensation under Clause 39B.3 including for any payments
under Clause 39B.5 shall be made to Post Office and not any of the
Tower Contractors and that all payments of such relief or compensation
shall be by Post Office and not any Tower Contractor.

The provisions of Clause 44.6 shall not be taken as limiting the right of Post Office to
claim from Fujitsu Services for:

44.10.1 additional operational and administrative costs and expenses; and/or

44.10.2expenditure or charges rendered unnecessary as a result of any Default by
Fujitsu Services; and/or

44.10.3any compensation arising out of a Fujitsu Dependency Failure due to Post
Office, Post Office Service Integrator or a Tower Contractor.

The Parties expressly agree that should any limitation or provision contained in this
Clause be held to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law it shall to that
extent be deemed omitted but if any Party thereby becomes liable for loss or damage
which would otherwise have been excluded such liability shall be subject to the other
limitations and provisions set out herein.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged that nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed or construed to relieve either Party of its common law duty to the other Party
against which a claim may be made to mitigate any loss which is the subject of such
claim.

Each of the sums referred to in Clauses 44.2.2, 44.2.3(a)(3), 44.3 and 44.10 shall be

the end of each subsequent Financial Year by an amount equal to the difference
(expressed as a percentage) between the level of the Retail Price Index most recently
published in respect of December of the Financial Year in question and the level of the

self-insurance against all losses and damages which are the result of its fault or
negligence in performing the Services, including workman's compensation, public
liability, product liability, property damage and professional indemnity. Fujitsu Services
will, if requested in writing by Post Office, produce to Post Office a certificate of

provided for the period up to the relevant date specified in Table A of Schedule B3.1 on
which date such Expiring Service shall expire. Liquidated damages shall continue to apply

Both Parties acknowledge that Post Office may request further extensions to the
Expiring Services. Both Parties agree to act reasonably in the event of any such
request and any associated negotiation of terms. In particular, Fujitsu Services agrees
to mitigate its costs of supply and stranded costs with respect to any further extension
of the Expiring Services to the extent that it is reasonably possible to do so having
regard to, amongst other things, the timing of any request relative to the expiry date of
the Expiring Services.

The Terminating Services shall cease on 31st March 2023 unless terminated earlier by
Post Office in accordance with Clause 47.10.2(a)(ii) of the Agreement. The Parties

Terminable Service or expiry of an Expiring Service) that is required for continuing
Services or for a Next Supplier), in which case Fujitsu Services shall at no additional
cost to Post Office, remove such parts of the Infrastructure as soon as reasonably
practicable and shall make good any damage to the Post Office Premises occasioned
by such removal.

Post Office shall only be permitted to exercise its rights pursuant to Clause 47.1.1 for

such rights where Post Office has agreed in advance in writing to the particular change
of control and such change of control takes place as proposed. Fujitsu Services shall

paid by Post Office to Fujitsu Services upon such Partial Termination.
For the avoidance of doubt, it is noted that during the 6 months’ notice

48.4.2 the right to require that Fujitsu Services shall assign or novate, or (if
assignment or novation is not possible) arrange for the benefit thereof to be

the purpose by Post Office any sub-contracts, equipment rental or lease
agreements and all other agreements (other than employment agreements and
agreements in relation to Third Party Software, Third Party Items or Non-
standard Third Party Materials), except in respect of Fujitsu Services
Subcontract agreement with Ingenico for Payment and Banking Service which
Fujitsu Services shall assign or novate where required in accordance with
clause 58.6.3, entered into by Fujitsu Services which are necessary to the
performance of the Services as Post Office may designate,

provided that, if termination is in respect of a Terminable Service rather than the entire
Agreement, the above provisions shall apply only to those Project Assets (or, in the
case of agreements, that part thereof) that are not reasonably required by Fujitsu
Services for the provision of any continuing Services under this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the generality of Clause 48.1 Post Office agrees:

48.5.1 only to exercise its rights under such Clause to the extent that the relevant
Project Assets apply to, and are required for the provision or receipt of the
Services or Terminable Services that are the subject of the termination or
expiry or are otherwise to be provided pursuant to Schedule E (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Exit Plan);

48.5.2 the rights provided for in Clauses 48.1 shall not apply to the Superstock
Solution; and

48.5.3 in the case of Partial Termination of the Engineering Service, that it shall
acquire or shall ensure that the Next Supplier acquires from Fujitsu Services all
of the Project Assets referred to in Clause 48.1.1 that relate to the Engineering
Service comprising the Counter Equipment used in Branches up to the network
connection sockets in each Branch, as well as spare Counter Equipment held
by Fujitsu Services intended for such use.

In the event that Post Office exercises any of the options in Clause 48.1 or Clause
48.2.3 applies, Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu Services on completion of such option
or, in the case of Clause 48.2.3, such acquisition, a sum equal to the Transfer
Payment. If Post Office exercises the option in Clause 48.1 in respect of any Partial
Termination or in respect of the expiry of an Expiring Service or Clause 48.2.3 applies,
the Project Assets acquired by it shall cease to form part of the Infrastructure and this
Agreement shall be amended accordingly as provided in Schedule E.

termination Services shall survive only to the extent required to govern such
Services.

48.7.3 Upon termination or expiry, Post Office shall be entitled to offer employment
(or an agreement for services with Post Office) to any employee or sub-
contractor (being an individual) (“Worker”) of Fujitsu Services who has during
the six months prior to such offer been involved for at least 75 percent. of his
contracted working time in performing Fujitsu Services’ obligations under this
Agreement which are the subject of the termination or expiry. Fujitsu Services
agrees that if that Worker accepts such offer Fujitsu Services shall release that
Worker from any breach of contract with it (other than in relation to such
person's obligations of confidentiality and notice of termination) which such
acceptance may otherwise involve.

All the assets to be acquired pursuant to the exercise by Post Office of its option under
Clause 48 shall be acquired and any software, documents materials or other things
provided by Fujitsu Services pursuant to the licences granted under Clauses 48.8 to
48.13 shall be provided “as is", but (apart from such licences) free from encumbrances

The Parties have agreed to populate the CCD entitled “Transfer Asset Register”
(COM/MGT/REP/0001) with details of all Software data, tools, utilities, documentation
and other items necessary to perform the Services and run the Applications (and to

those that are shared between one Terminable Service or Expiring Service and another
Service or Services), and to agree, in accordance with the guidance contained in that
CCD, the most appropriate treatment of such item. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the categorisation and proposed treatment of such items
agreed in that CCD shall take precedence over Clause 48.13 which shall be deemed
superseded by such CCD when agreed by the Parties.

58. Transfer and Sub-Contracting

58.4 This Agreement is personal to Fujitsu Services. Fujitsu Services shall not assign,
novate, sub-contract or otherwise dispose of this Agreement or any part thereof without
the previous written consent of Post Office.

58.5 Subject to Clause 58.5 Post Office hereby consents to Fujitsu Services having
subcontracted its obligations specified in Schedule C2 to the respective sub-contractors
specified therein. Additional or substitute sub-contractors may be approved from time
to time in accordance with Clause 58.1 after the date hereof, in which case Schedule
C2 shall be amended accordingly. Fujitsu Services may permit its Subcontractor,
Ingenico, to further subcontract to one of its group undertakings (as defined in Section
1161 of the Companies Act 2006) located within the European Union and the Australian
affiliate provided in Schedule C2 to deliver the Payment and Banking Service without
the prior consent of Post Office, provided that such Fujitsu Services’ Subcontractor
provides notice in writing to Post Office within one (1) month of such subcontracting.
Notwithstanding any sub-contracting permitted in this Agreement, Fujitsu Services shall
remain primarily responsible for the acts and omissions of its sub-contractors
committed by them in the course of performing or purporting to perform any of Fujitsu
Services’ obligations on Fujitsu Services’ behalf as though such acts or omissions were
its own.

58.6 Post Office shall be entitled to assign, novate or otherwise dispose of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement or any part thereof (including, where appropriate,
requiring the grant by Fujitsu Services or its licensors of a direct licence of any
Software other than Third Party Software, and requiring Fujitsu Services to use all
reasonable endeavours to procure the grant of a direct licence or obtain consent to the
transfer of the sub-licence of any Third Party Software) to any other body which
performs any of the functions that previously had been performed by Post Office,
provided that any such assignment, novation or other disposal shall not increase the
burden of Fujitsu Services' obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

58.7 Post Office shall be entitled to disclose, to the extent necessary for the purposes of this
Agreement, to any transferee any Confidential Information of Fujitsu Services which
relates to the performance of the Services by Fujitsu Services. In such circumstances
Post Office shall authorise the transferee to use such Confidential Information only for
purposes relating to the performance of the Services and for no other purposes and, for
the avoidance of doubt, the transferee shall be bound by the confidentiality undertaking
contained herein in relation to such Confidential Information.

respect of additional or substitute sub-contractors pursuant to Clause 58.2 is provided,
and shall be granted (as the case may be), on the understanding that Fujitsu Services
shall keep Post Office informed of the general nature and scope of the work to be sub-
contracted and the duration of the relevant sub-contracts (such information to be
recorded in Schedule C2) and shall consult with Post Office prior to amending or
supplementing such arrangements or commitments and shall take account of all
reasonable requests and comments that Post Office shall make in connection
therewith.

58.9 Fujitsu

Services shall procure that the Subcontract agreement with Ingenico for the

Payment and Banking Service shall contain the following terms:

58.9.1

58.9.2

58.9.3

such Subcontract may, subject to 48.6.3, be novated to Post Office or its
nominee at any time, and provided that Post Office remains in ultimate
ownership of the Crown at the time of novation, and the terms of such novation
shall provide that the Subcontract is amended following novation such that:

(a) the Subcontract is capable of extension at the option of the entity to whom
the Subcontract has been novated for up to two (2) periods of one (1) year
each;

on the extension dates, the service charges (but not transaction charges)
under the Subcontract shall be increased by the annual percentage
increase in the Retail Prices Index during the previous twelve (12) months;
(c) Ingenico shall cooperate, acting reasonably and in good faith, with the
entity to whom the Subcontract has been novated to carry out any
necessary integrations to new systems required as a result of the novation;
and

any additional required integration will be agreed between the parties
through the change control procedure; and

(e) terms equivalent to clauses 20.1 and 30.21.2.

(b)

(d)

Further, Fujitsu Services shall not make any material amendment or variation
to its subcontract in respect of the Payment and Banking Services with its
Subcontractor Ingenico (including any amendments to the charges and fees
payable thereunder, the term, the licences of intellectual property, applicable
service levels or the provisions mandated by this clause) without the prior
written consent of Post Office.

Where Post Office wish for the Fujitsu Services’ Subcontract agreement with
Ingenico for the Payment and Banking Service to be novated to a Post Office
nominee, Post Office shall provide details of the Post Office nominee as soon
as reasonably practical. Where there are Grounds for Rejection which gives
rise to a legitimate commercial reason for Fujitsu Services’ Subcontractor,
Ingenico, not wanting to contract with the Post Office nominee, Fujitsu Services
shall promptly notify Post Office of these and shall provide reasonable
evidence to support such Grounds for Rejection. Fujitsu Services shall procure
that its Subcontractor, Ingenico, shall in good faith enter into discussions with
Post Office to attempt to resolve any such Grounds for Rejection. Where
Fujitsu Services’ Subcontractor, Ingenico, does not provide approval to Fujitsu
Services’ Subcontract agreement with Ingenico for the Payment and Banking
Service being novated to the Post Office nominee, such Subcontract will
instead be novated to Post Office. For the purpose of this clause 13.3,
“Grounds for Rejection” shall mean the following:

(a) the Post Office nominee has a credit rating of less than BBB as classified
by Standard & Poor's or an equivalent rating by another comparable credit
rating agency;

(b) the Post Office nominee has committed fraudulent behaviour, criminal
activity, or breach of a regulator's requirement;

Services’ Subcontractor, Ingenico;

(e) the Post Office nominee provides services similar to the Services in
competition with Fujitsu Services’ Subcontractor, Ingenico;

(f) the Post Office nominee is involved in or has been involved in litigations
with Fujitsu Services’ Subcontractor, Ingenico, or a member of its group;

(g) contracting with the Post Office nominee would have a negative tax impact

on Fujitsu Services’ Subcontractor, Ingenico; and/or
(h) the Post Office nominee presents an actual or anticipated adverse impact

or risk to the Fujitsu Services’ Subcontractor, Ingenico’s: (i) ability to
perform its business; (ii) market value; (iii) reputation, (iv) operational
security; or (v) ability to service new or existing customers.

Non-Solicitation

Subject to Clause 48.4.3, neither Party shall during the currency of the Agreement or
for a period of six months thereafter without the written permission of the other (not to
be unreasonably withheld) either on its own account or for any other person, firm or
undertaking either directly or indirectly knowingly solicit or entice away from the other
(the "Previous Employer") any Key Individual who is then or shall have been in the
previous three months either:

59.4.1 an employee of the Previous Employer; or

59.4.2 engaged by the Previous Employer as a contractor performing the services of
such an employee.

In the event that such Key Individual is employed or engaged by the other Party with
the agreement of the other Party (such agreement to include without limitation agreed
transfer of work and associated staff between the Parties during the term of the
Agreement) or after redundancy from the Previous Employer, the Previous Employer
shall not (unless agreed otherwise) be paid any sum by the other Party by way of
compensation.

If either Party is in breach of this condition that Party will pay to the other Party by way
of liquidated damages and not by way of penalty the Solicitation Fee.

Nothing in this Clause 59 is intended to prevent or frustrate the right of any individual to
seek employment as he thinks fit.

Force Majeure

For the purposes of this Agreement the expression "Force Majeure" shall mean any
cause affecting the performance by a Party hereto of its obligations arising from acts,
events, omissions, happenings or non-happenings beyond its reasonable control
including (but without limiting the generality thereof) (i) Governmental Regulations

(subject to Clause 60.7), (ii) fire, (iii) flood, or (iv) any disaster or an industrial dispute
affecting a third party. Any act, event, omission, happening or non-happening will only
be considered Force Majeure if it is not attributable to the wilful act, neglect or failure to
take reasonable precautions of the affected Party, its agents or employees, and only if
a substitute third party is not reasonably available (having regard, without limitation, to
the cost and quality of such substitute) to perform the affected obligation. In no event
shall any fraudulent act or omission by any third party or Party in relation to the
Services for which Fujitsu Services is liable under Clause 43.1 constitute a Force
Majeure event.

Neither Party hereto shall in any circumstances be liable to the other Party hereto for
any loss of any kind whatsoever including but not limited to any damages or abatement
of Charges whether directly or indirectly caused to or incurred by the other Party by
reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement which is due to Force Majeure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party
shall use all reasonable endeavours to continue to perform, or resume performance of,
such obligations under this Agreement for the duration of such Force Majeure event. In
the case of any such failure or delay on the part of Fujitsu Services, the Parties shall
agree an orderly process for such continuation or resumption of performance (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and Fujitsu Services shall comply
with such process. Fujitsu Services shall remain liable to perform the Business
Continuity Services, save where such Business Continuity Services are themselves
also affected by Force Majeure, in which case Fujitsu Services shall be required to use
all reasonable endeavours to perform such Business Continuity Services.

If Fujitsu Services shall become aware of circumstances of Force Majeure which give
rise to or which are likely to give rise to any such failure or delay on its part it shall
forthwith notify Post Office within one Working Day and shall inform Post Office of the
period which it is estimated that such failure or delay shall continue. If Post Office shall
become aware of circumstances of Force Majeure which give rise to any such failure or
delay on its part, it shall forthwith notify Fujitsu Services within one Working Day and
shall inform Fujitsu Services of the period which it is estimated that such failure or
delay shall continue.

It is expressly agreed that any failure by Fujitsu Services to perform, or any delay by
Fujitsu Services in performing, its obligations under this Agreement which results from
any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations by any person, firm or
company with which Fujitsu Services shall have entered into any contract, supply
arrangement or sub-contract or otherwise shall be regarded as a failure or delay due to
Force Majeure only in the event that such person firm or company shall itself be
prevented from or delayed in complying with its obligations under such contract, supply
arrangement or sub-contract or otherwise as a result of circumstances of Force Majeure
and there is no substitute person, firm or company reasonably available (having regard,
without limitation, to the cost and quality of such substitute) to perform the affected
obligation.

If any Force Majeure event prevents any Party from performing its obligations
hereunder for a period in excess of 90 consecutive days, Post Office may after

Extension of Time

If the performance of this Agreement by either Party is delayed by reason of any Force
Majeure event (as defined in Clause 60.1), both Parties shall be entitled to a
reasonable extension of time subject to there being no entitlement to any additional
costs or expenses incurred as a result of the delay. The Party so delayed shall notify
the other Party in writing within one Working Day of becoming aware of the Force

77 Belfast Datacentres

It is noted by both Parties that it has not been possible to conclude the extension to the
leases to the Belfast datacentres prior to 16th February 2016. To this end, there
remains a risk that the lease extensions will not be concluded and that Fujitsu Services
will be required to transition the hosted equipment to a replacement datacentre or
alternative service solution agreed by both Parties. In the unlikely event that this risk
crystalises such that Fujitsu Services has to exit a datacentre, Fujitsu Services shall not
be entitled to charge Post Office its own costs of moving and re-installing the
equipment (nor any moving and installing costs relating to Fujitsu Service's Sub-
contractors or suppliers). However, Post Office shall (and shall procure its third party
suppliers, clients and customers shall) facilitate such a transition (at no additional cost
to Fujitsu Services) by:

76.1 arranging and procuring Post Office's third party suppliers, clients and
customers shall install and parallel run network connections needed to the
existing and new datacentres; and
