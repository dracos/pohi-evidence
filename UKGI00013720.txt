Thank you for your letter of 5 August to Edward Davey informing him that
instructions had been given to solicitors to issues Letters of Claim against Post
Office Ltd on behalf of JFSA members.

As I am sure you will appreciate, the Minister receives far more
correspondence than he is able to reply to personally and I have therefore
been asked to reply on his behalf. It is helpful to be kept informed of such
developments.

Yours sincerely

Mike Whitehead
