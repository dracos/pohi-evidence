POL REMUNERATION

Feedback from ShEx (Susannah Storey)

The Chairman welcomed Susannah Storey to the meeting and
explained that she had invited Susannah Storey to put the process
for approval of Post Office Board remuneration into context from a
Shareholder perspective.

Susannah Storey explained that after separation the controls
currently existing in the RMH articles would be incorporated into
POL articles and this would mean that matters relating to Board
remuneration (base salary and incentives) would need the
Shareholder's consent. She stressed that the authorisation process
can take some time and emphasised the need to ensure any
proposal put by Remco to the Government was properly justified
and benchmarked to enable decisions to be taken. The personal
objectives on which any bonuses were predicated needed to be
justifiable and not seen as “just doing the job”.

Susannah Storey explained that recent history shows significant
over achievement against stretch targets and this has inevitably
called into doubt whether the targets were challenging enough.

Les Owen highlighted that both Royal Mail Group and Post Office
Ltd dealt with small profit targets but calculated from significant
revenue and cost figures, and that this could lead to large
variances. He suggested the Business needed to find a measure
which was more aligned to share price for its long term incentive.

The Chairman stressed the need to get proposals into the
Government early and ensure that individuals were genuinely
incentivised but not over rewarded.

Susannah Storey emphasised that only the remuneration of the
Board needed to go to ShEx, but that included any salary changes
and any short or long term incentive proposals.

Matthew Starks asked what is the Shareholder view of paying a
bonus for performance below the target. Susannah Story explained
that there was no set view and that the Business needed to argue
its case but that Ministers had very publicly stated that they would
not reward failure, so any proposal needed to bear this in mind.

Susannah Storey left the meeting.

LTIP

The Chairman asked Les Owen for his input on the LTIP paper
POLB(12)01 as he had experience of the RMG scheme. Les Owen
reported that from his private sector experience he was used to
seeing the bonus expressed on an annual basis but that the three
year amounts appeared to be appropriate and reasonable. He
emphasised the need to find a less volatile metric for the financial
target.

Chris Day explained that the Business had only just hit the last LTIP
targets and that the next three years profit targets were very
stretching. Les Owen explained that he was not suggesting the
Business always over achieves its profit target but that the number
was volatile and susceptible to large negative and positive
variances.

The Chairman emphasised the need for very different measures for
the short term and long term targets. Neil McCausland suggested
that the LTIP should target the Business outputs and focus on being
financially sustainable. Paula Vennells explained why the Network
Conversions were important in changing the Business cost base
and therefore should be a gateway to any LTIP bonus payment.
The Board agreed that the Network Conversion gateway target
should be set at 5400 (90%) which aligned to the MDA agreement.

The Chairman asked the Board if they believed bonuses should be
paid for delivering below 100 of the profit target. Les Owen
accepted the perception of rewarding failure but highlighted the
danger of ‘cliff vesting’ as this could drive the wrong behaviours in
the Business. He suggested a gradation around the target point
with significant increase for achieving the target. Neil McCausland
agreed.

Les Owen pointed out that it would be important for the Remco to
have some discretion in relation to the LTIP because it is impossible
to be certain in advance that all relevant matters have been
anticipated when agreeing the scheme.

The Chairman asked if the forthcoming TUPE of staff from RMG to
POL would effect the remuneration proposal. Matthew Starks
explained that any changes to peoples’ terms and conditions
needed to be deemed of a reasonable nature and had to pass the
“substantially equivalent” test, and that the longer the time between
the TUPE and the change the better. The Business would test any
proposal with the TUPE lawyers. Paula Vennells hoped we could
design something which would be acceptable for the long term
rather that have to make further changes in the short term.

Paula Vennells and Chris Day left the meeting whilst their
remuneration was discussed. Discussions were not minuted.

Paula Vennells and Chris Day rejoined the meeting.

The Chairman asked that a proposal be brought back to the Board
based on the discussions to date (including higher ranges for CEO
and CFO) with a gateway for Network Conversions; a small reward
for achieving 90% of the financial target; but with the main bonus at
100% and significant rewards for hitting stretch targets. It was
agreed that the work needed to be completed as quickly as possible
to enable a proposal to the Shareholder before the end of the
financial year.

Remuneration Structure

The Board discussed the STIP (short term incentive scheme)
structure. Paula Vennells clarified that the PDR score related to the
annual performance review against personal objectives and that
approximately 15% of employees were graded as 1 or 2. Neil
McCausland asked to see the distribution of scores for the last 2
years, which would be circulated to the Board.

Neil McCausland emphasised the need to focus on financial
measures and those drivers which effect financial performance. Les
Owen proposed a structure where greater bonus was attributed to
profit or sales, but where other targets such as Health and Safety
had to be passed or the bonus achieved would be reduced.

The Chairman asked that customer measures play a significant part
in any calculation but stressed the need for measurable targets.

Neil McCausland added that moving the Business towards
performance related pay as well as bonus would be beneficial.

Managers Pay 2011-12
Matthew Starks updated the Board on the CMA pay negotiations.

Crown Managers have been offered 1.4% to mirror the CWU grade
award, and admin managers have been offered 1.6% plus £400
cash payment to be paid against specific objectives. This award is
greater than that offered by RMG but has been cleared with RM
CEO. Discussions are continuing with the CMA and Matthew
Starks will update the Board if there are any significant changes or
the pay deal is agreed.

POLB12/06 POL GOVERNANCE
(a) The Governance paper was presented as a basis for an opening
discussion on this issue; it had not been discussed in advance with

the Chairman who would work with Susan Crichton on it after the
Board

Neil McCausland asked for clarification of delegated authorities
from ShEx alongside the decisions ShEx retained.

Les Owen stressed the need to include ‘Going Concern’
ACTION: discussions as part of the Board’s governance. Chris Day agreed
Chris Day to discuss with Matthew Lester (RMG CFO) and introduce the
necessary reporting process at the Board.

The Chairman explained that she would like to understand the
rationale for proposed delegated authorities and their implications.

Les Owen questioned whether POL would need a Board Pensions
Sub-committee, but Paula Vennells asked to keep this in the short-
term as the sectionalisation, investment and funding strategies
would all need detailed work.

It was suggested that the Health & Safety Sub-committee could be
an Executive Sub-committee and the Board would be updated
through the Managing Director's Report.

Susan Crichton suggested that the Audit Sub-committee should

expand to include risk and compliance as this would give Board

rigour and sub-committee oversight to the reporting of compliance
ACTION: by management.

Susan Crichton Susan Crichton to bring a proposal back to the Board after the
discussion with the Chairman.

POLB12/07 SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION REPORT
- Noting Paper (POLB(12)13)

(a) Les Owen asked for assurance that there was no substance to the
claims bought by subpostmasters which had featured in Private
Eye.

Susan Crichton explained that the subpostmasters were
challenging the integrity of the Horizon system. However the system
had been audited by RMG Internal Audit with the reports reviewed
by Deloittes. The audit report was very positive.

The Business has also won every criminal prosecution in which it
has used evidence based on the Horizon system's integrity.

ACTION: Susan Crichton suggested that she clear the audit report with the
Susan Crichton external lawyers and if it is possible to give the report privileged
status it would be circulate it to the Board.

POLB12/09 EAGLE UPDATE

(a) Heads of Terms
Nick Kennett reported that the Heads of Terms has been signed on
29" December 2011 and the hope was to have the contract in place
by the end of March.

(b) Insurance
The issue of where insurance would sit in the Business is yet to be
resolved. Bol have proposed that this part of the current joint
venture be retained within Midasgrange (which will be wholly owned
by Bol), but with a new Board.

Nick Kennett explained why he thought this structure was too
bureaucratic and suggested an alternative.

The Chairman asked that Nick Kennett provide a paper to the
ACTION: Board setting out his alternative proposal with the negotiations
Nick Kennett mandate he requires.

Les Owen agreed and stressed the importance that any new
structure enables POL to have control over products, incentives and
sales campaigns.

Neil McCausland emphasised the need to manage the short term
Junction contract effectively to ensure no penalty was paid. Nick
Kennett reported that Junction were supportive of including the 30k
Van Insurances currently with AVIVA in the portfolio until Sept

running the Insurance Business. Nick Kennett reported that the last
two weeks had seen the portfolio grow for the first time in three

PREFERRED SUPPLIER — OUTPUT FROM TELEPHONY
TENDER

Martin Moran explained that the Telephony Tender process was
now complete, and that the preferred bidder was Fujitsu.

Neil McCausland questioned the reliance on Fujitsu. Martin Moran

explained that we were their third biggest customer worth circa 5%
of their turnover. But the new contract provided only a small return
for Fujitsu with the bulk of the contract passed through to Talk Talk.

The Chairman asked if there was any scope to reduce the price of
the contract further. Martin Moran explained that it had already
been reduced three times so he would not want to reopen the price,
but that he had negotiated IP rights for Horizon and a £2m
reduction in Horizon change request charges for 2012/13, as well
as step in rights to work direct with Talk Talk etc if Fujitsu failed.

The Board endorsed the recommendation and congratulated Martin
Moran on the deal.
