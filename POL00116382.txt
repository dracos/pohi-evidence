Hi — just in case Priti Patel or her researchers turn up attached is the letter that will most likely go out tomorrow. Just
in case they ask where we are in the response.

Priti Patel MP wrote to Paula on a Horizon mediation scheme case on behalf of her constituent Mr Graham Ward.

(Copy attached)

A response from Paula which explains that a full reply will go from Sir Anthony Hooper has been drafted (draft

attached).

(Belinda has agreed the approach and the draft response from the working group with Sir Anthony Hooper WG PRITI

PATEL RESPONSE)

I would be grateful if you can arrange for the response from Paula to be sent and if you can let us know when this has
gone so that we can make arrangements for the Working Group response to be sent.

Many thanks

Hi Martin,
Apologies for the delay in getting this to you.
Attached is a draft letter to Priti Patel from Paula (PAULA PRITI PATEL RESPONSE).

We had to make sure that Sir Anthony Hooper (Chair of the Working Group for the Scheme) was ok with the response
we were drafting from him first.

If you could let David (cc’d) know when this has gone we will get the WG letter sent out to Priti Patel (if it could go
today that would be great).

Thanks
Sophie
