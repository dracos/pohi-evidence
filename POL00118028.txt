COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS — AS AT 06/03/19 22.00
HORIZON TRIAL — NARRATIVE/ KEY MESSAGES

We are vigorously defending allegations being made about Horizon, the electronic ‘point of
sale’ system used in every Post Office branch to record and reconcile each transaction.

The claims are being made by a small minority of mainly former postmasters and span nearly
two decades during which time many tens of thousands of postmasters and their staff have
successfully operated Post Office branches using Horizon to process billions of transactions.

We've conducted thorough investigations into individual complaints, sought to resolve
some of the claims through mediation and have met with the parties concerned on
numerous occasions

No IT system is perfect but there is no suggestion of fundamental or systemic flaws in
Horizon. Instead, all the indications are that Horizon is robust and has become more so over
time.

With a UK-wide network of 11,500 Post Office branches processing 47 million transactions a
week we are very alive to potential technical issues, with multiple countermeasures in place
to prevent or detect and resolve them

As the largest cash handler in the UK, with more that £600 million held in our network at any
given time, we also depend on our postmasters and their staff to follow agreed procedures
to protect Post Office money in their branches. Post Office cannot be present day-to-day in
all its branches and relies on postmasters to carry these out diligently.

We will not comment outside of public Court hearings on specific detail about the allegations
being made. It is for the Court to examine the claims and we believe this process provides
the best opportunity for the dispute to be heard and resolved.

VERBAL SCRIPT FOR L300 CALL [MARK DAVIES]

As you are all aware, there is continuing Group Litigation involving Post Office and a small minority
of mainly former postmasters

This is complex litigation and is being heard by the Court through a series of trials. As you know, the
first trial - called the Common Issues trial and concerning contractual matters between Post Office
and postmasters - was held late last year, ending in early December. The Judgment from that trial
POL00118028

POL00118028

has not yet been handed down (made public) but we will of course provide you with information
about it when that happens.

The second trial in the case is scheduled to start next Monday (11 March) and concerns technical
matters about Horizon. The trial will continue until 11 April, although the Court will not be sitting
every day.

Neither the Common Issues trial nor the Horizon trial should decide liability in individual cases.
Further trials are being scheduled for November this year and March 2020 and we will keep you
updated about these.

We can of course expect some media coverage about the upcoming Horizon trial. Our media
statement will support our overall position — that we dispute and are vigorously defending the
allegations being made - but again we will not be providing a running commentary because it is for
the Court to examine the claims. Despite difficult and often misleading media coverage we have
never discussed individual cases publicly and we will not be doing so outside of public Court
hearings. We strongly believe that this is a fair and appropriate approach to all parties.

We’ve taken these complaints extremely seriously and conducted investigations, sought to resolve
some of the claims through mediation and have met with the parties concerned on numerous
occasions. We have done this with empathy for the people involved.

Extensive scrutiny of Horizon has provided no suggestion of systemic flaws. No IT system is perfect
but all the indications are that Horizon is robust and has become more so over time.

With our branches processing 47 million transactions a week we are very alive to potential technical
issues, with countermeasures in place to prevent or detect and resolve them.

The claims in the litigation span a period of nearly two decades during which time many tens of
thousands of postmasters and their staff have successfully operated Post Office branches using
Horizon to process billions of transactions.

We are of course concerned to reassure everyone in the business, especially our postmasters and
those working in our network.

We will be communicating, via One, across the business ahead of next week and, as we have done
previously, we will make some background facts and questions and answers available along with
contact numbers for any questions or concerns.

Basic statement before Monday (to be reviewed with legal against nature of enquiry):

We are defending the allegations being made by a small minority of mainly former

ONE COMMUNICATION — POSTMASTER AUDIENCE [TO BE CONFIRMED WITH LEGAL]
Group Litigation

As some of you may be aware, there is a continuing legal dispute, being heard in the High
Court, involving Post Office.

This concerns allegations that for some years have been made by a small minority of mainly
former postmasters about Horizon and other operational and contractual matters. A High
Court claim was issued in 2016 and Post Office is vigorously defending the allegations.

Between 11 March and 11 April 2019 there will be a trial on technical matters regarding
Horizon, the second of a series of trials in this complex litigation.

It would not be fair or appropriate to comment outside of public Court hearings on specific
detail arising from the individual cases involved.

But we do want to reassure you that we’ve taken these complaints extremely seriously and
conducted investigations, sought to resolve some of the claims through mediation and have met
with the parties concerned on numerous occasions.

There is no suggestion of fundamental or systemic flaws in Horizon. With our UK-wide

FACT SHEET ON LITIGATION

Group Litigation is where a_ group of people with similar or shared grievances join together
to make a claim in the Courts against a person or organisation

The litigation involving Post Office is part of a long running dispute between Post Office and
a group of mostly former postmasters who have made serious allegations about technical,
operational and contractual matters

Between 2012-15 Post Office performed independent investigations and established a
mediation scheme for individual complaints.
POL00118028
POL00118028

In February 2016 it was reported that some former postmasters involved had obtained
funding for litigation against Post Office

In April 2016, a High Court claim was issued against Post Office and in March 2017 the Court
issued a Group Litigation Order, a procedural tool to enable the Court to manage litigation
affecting multiple parties

As is usual practice in group litigation, the Group Litigation Order was advertised and
promoted for a time specified by the Court to enable potential claimants to seek to join the
claim. This was done by the claimants’ legal representatives between 17 March 2017 and 17
November 2017. There are 557 claimants, with individual complaints that span the past two
decades. This represents a very small proportion of people who have worked in our network
using our systems during that time

The case is very complex and the Judge has ordered that it will be heard as a series of trials

The first trial, which finished on 5 December 2018, was about determining the legal
construction of the contract between Post Office and agents - the Common Issues trial. The
Judgment from this trial has not yet been handed down (made public).

The second trial, between 11 March and 11 April 2019 is about technical matters concerning
Post Office’s Horizon computer system

Neither of these trials should decide liability or the individual claimants’ cases. Further trials
are scheduled for November 2019 and March 2020.

BACKGROUND FACTS ABOUT HORIZON

Horizon is the electronic point of sale system used across all Post Office branches to record
and reconcile each transaction.

The original Horizon system was first introduced in 1995 on a pilot basis in a small number of
Post Office branches, before being introduced more widely. The current version - Horizon

On Line - was introduced in 2010.

Horizon currently has around 60,000 users and 47 million transactions are processed every
week.

using our systems during that time.

Q. How will the High Court case be finally resolved?

The litigation is very complex. The Court has decided it will be phased and heard in a series
of trials: The first trial, which finished on 5 December 2018, was about determining the legal
construction of the contract between Post Office and agents - the Common Issues trial.

The second trial, between 11 March and 11 April 2019, is about technical matters concerning
Post Office’s Horizon computer system

Neither of these trials should decide liability or the individual claimants’ cases. Further trials
are scheduled for November 2019 and March 2020.

Two further trials have been scheduled by the Court for November 2019 and March 2020.
The content of those trials is still being determined by the Court.

General

Q. Ihave seen media reports with some former postmasters commenting while Post
Office is not — why are we not providing media with comment?

A. We do not believe it is fair or appropriate to comment about individual cases outside of
public Court hearings but we’re working hard to ensure our overall position - that we dispute
and are vigorously defending the allegations being made - is reflected in the media. It’s

regrettable that some media reporting and online commenting can be partial but we believe
that the Court’s process provides the best opportunity for the complex matters in dispute to

be heard and resolved.
Q. I have been approached by the media, what should I do?

As usual, please simply provide them with the details of Post Office press office
(pressoffice: ‘or telephone: The press office can be
contacted 24 hours a day.

Q. I have been asked questions that I cannot answer from the information provided.
Who can I contact?

A. Please advise the person asking you the questions that you will seek a response. Send
their contact details and questions to the communications team and we will respond

Q. Is there any change to how branches should obtain help and support?

A. No. Help and support should be sought through our usual channels.
