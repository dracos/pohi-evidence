MP No, but other people on occasions have come in collect them for him like
his daughter did I think and his brother in Law

cP Um hah
MP Right
cP Yep
MP Explain to us what a reversal is please
cP You're just reversing the transaction, that's all ‘
MP" Right, what would the reasons be for reversing it
cP Maybe I put it in twice or I'm showing a loss or gain, as I said I might
‘ have put it in twice by accident
MP Right
cP Or he might have phoned me up and say......how much er are 36 euros

what's the best rate and the way you have ? probably one point
whatever it was

MP Right

cP And I give him that and come in next morning to balance of, is the 9" of
May a Wednesday or a Thursday moming

MP I think you'll find it's a Thursday

cP Well I come in to balance the till off on the Thursday morning and I've

‘ just reversed the cheque
MP Is ita Thursday
Colin Thursday yeah

cP It's very rare that he comes in at that time, that's all I can say

Colin If that was a Wednesday, the transaction was done
cP I'd have balance the till on the Thursday morning before everyone
opened up
Colin Is that what you do
cP Yeah .
Colin So that
cp It’s the work loading
Colin “Would have been done before you actually balanced
cP That's right yeah, see it would have made difference to the till
Colin Because you can't do reversals in different weeks can you
.I CP. Well I haven't rolled over have I

Colin That's what I'm saying

cP Cause on'the Wednesday we do all, you know main majority of the
