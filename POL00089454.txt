In my opinion the evidence is sufficient to afford a realistic prospect of conviction. The
draft charge is attached. In light of his admissions in interview, the prospects of success

are good.

In view of the nature of the charge, amount involved and breach of trust element, this is

not a case suitable for caution.

The case is borderline not suitable for trial in the Magistrates Court, given sentencing

powers of 6 months for the single offence.

Please the attached charging advice for further information.

enclose for your attention your original file of papers.

Should you have any queries then please do not hesitate to contact me at this office.

Yours sincerely
