Jonathan,
Following on from our conversation earlier today, I attach:

-  Deloitte’s (draft) Board Update, which preceded the full (draft) Report you have seen; and

- A “FactFile” prepared by POL, which provides an overview of the Horizon system and Post Office's branch

trading practices, and may assist in describing the system which Deloitte was asked to review.

Our CEO is concerned about the time available to knock Deloitte’s work into shape. Can you please therefore get to us
by close of play today the structure/outline you would like it to take, so as to maximise the time available to Deloitte to
repackage their findings.
With thanks for your assistance,

Rod
