Dear Jocq uw
Thank you for your letter of 9 January on behalf of vour constituent, Mr Julian

Wilson of , about
financial discrepancies at the Astwood Bank Post Office.

Since March 2001, Government's role in Royal Mail Group - which includes
Post Office Ltd (POL) - is that of a shareholder in a public limited company.
Under the Postal Services Act 2000, Parliament gave Royal Mail greater
commercial freedom and Government established an arm's length relationship
with the company so that the Board could run the business as it decides best
to meet the market developments and changing customer needs. Operational
decisions, which include decisions relating to the running of individual Post
Office branches are a matter for Post Office Ltd.

I understand that Glenn Chester of POL has written to you regarding the
investigations at the Astwood Bank branch. As you are aware, POL have
procedures in place to deal with issues of this nature and I am assured that
the appropriate action has been taken.

I am informed that Mr Wilson resigned from his position in September 2008
and was, therefore, not invited to be interviewed by POL regarding this matter.
In the circumstances I do not believe there is anything more that I can usefully
add.
