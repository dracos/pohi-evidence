Dear All

Papers are now available on Board Pad for the Board and Mutualisation Committee Meetings on 16 July and are
attached to this email.

Because of timing issues there will be 3 further papers on Friday:

The Horizon update is delayed because of a meeting with James Arbuthnot and JFSA tomorrow morning, and related to
this the significant litigation paper is being rechecked to ensure it incorporates all issues from the Horizon review

The papers include the period 2 financial papers, but because this Board is early this month Chris will also circulate P3
flash results which will not be available until Friday.

The Progress Report on Government Funding and Strategic Plan and the Pensions Valuation items will be presented as
verbal updates.
You will also find Board dates for 2014/15 under any other business for your feedback.

Finally Alice has asked that you bring to the Board your view of the 5 top Business risks, (prioritised 1-5 1 being the
greatest risk).

These are not for discussion but will be collected to feed into the ARC session in September.

lam also expecting an email and slides from Sue to be circulated this evening before the Vince and Jo meeting
tomorrow, setting out the mandated exit option discussed yesterday.

Thanks
Alwen
