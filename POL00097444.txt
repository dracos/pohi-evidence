Helen,
Attached are the transactions and events for 4" October 2012 from 09:30 to 09:40 GMT (ie 10:30 to 10:40 BST).

This shows that Session 537803 was successfully saved to the BRDB, but when the user JAROO1 Logged On again
Recovery reversed the session in session 537805.

It isn’t clear what failed, but if it was a comms error, then the system would have printed a disconnected session receipt
and the Clerk should have given the customer £80 and told him his Bill was unpaid. The fact that there js no indication
of such a receipt in the events table suggests the counter may have been rebooted and so perhaps may have crashed in
which case the clerk may not have been told exactly what to do.

The reversal was due to recovery (Counter Mode Id = 118} so this was not an explicit reversal by the clerk.

This scenario is fairly rare so it is certainly quite easy for the clerk to have made a mistake and either he or the customer
could be in pocket / out of pocket (depending on exactly what happened!).

The system is behaving as it should.

Helen,

Can you give me a more precise Date and Time (say with 10 mins} for the problem? I can look at data up to 6 months
old and October 2012 is within that 6 month window. (I don’t want to try and trawl through a month’s worth of data!)

Subject: RE: transaction log

Thanks Gareth, that sounds great.

From the credence data it just looks like an AP transaction and 5 minutes [ater a reversal, however the banking withdrawal
went through for £80 and was debited from the customers account. PMR did a banking withdrawal rather than payment
by debit card. From the data I can see, I would have just said that this was a reversal at the counter,

He denies transacting the reversal and has involved a forensic accountant to prove horizon fault.

{ would have expected the office to be £76 up due to the reversal but it wasn’t. (Customer was give the change for £3.61
for the difference from the withdrawal and the BT bill)

Helen,

I’ve tracked it down and it has been received here but not processed. I’ve asked if the raw lag can be returned as well as
the normal stuff so that I can confirm exactly what happened.

If you can show what you need from the normal extract then fine. If not I can probably help you find the info in the raw
fog.
Regards

Hi

Could I please order the fujitsu transaction log for Lepton 191320 for 4" October 2012 to 25" October 2012. (please let
me know if these dates fall outside one disc)

Could we please request that all session numbers are included not just sales and transactions - including any reason for
those not showing in sales, i.e. background comments, error messages, receipt printed or receipt not printed ete

POS, could you please let me know roughly the timescales on ordering these (as you know it’s a long time since I needed
one).

Many thanks
