Post Office accounting systems and procedures

Accounting procedures ~ Horizon

Lhave set out below certain deta:ls of the Post Office accounting systems and procedures
that were in place duriny theindictment period. This understanding is based on a review
ofa nurmber of Post Office operation manuals and user guides provided to. me, details of
which-have been set out in Section 4 below.

During the indictment periud the Posi Office used a computerised accounting sysiem
know as Horizon which kept a record of transactions undertaken during each week

‘The Weekly Horizon Cash. Acocuntwes structured as follows:

© Opening balance due to Past Office (stock and cash brought forward from
previous week) +X

» — Recetpts of cush and stock in week « X

Total ‘receipts’ ” ¥

* Payments and remittances in week -X

© Closing balance duc to Post Office (elesiny stock and:cash carried forward) - %

‘Total ‘payments" -~M

For each transaction carried out cash, a cheque, d debit. card payment or equivalent would
either be reecived from or paid to 2 customer. with the Pust Office providing something in
exchange e.g, cash in exchange for a voucher such as.a pension or benefit foil,

of the “bosk* casli und stock that’ should be on hard afier taking inte account all
transactions.

‘The individual who undertook the process of balancing the accounts at the end of each
week would verify the cash and stock on hand for each siock-unit and iiput these into
Horizon.

A balance would beachieved if the verified cach and stock en hand agreed with the book
eash and stock according ta the Horizoti snapshot. Ainy diserepaney cheuld be declared
as a shortfall or surplus in the Post Office’s Weekly Cash Account,

Tn effect, the “Balance due to Post Office’ would be a net balancitig figure. If all
transactions, including foreign: currency transactions drom the’ Forde Moneychanget had
been correctly entered in‘Harizon. then Horizon should balance.

Bureau de change and Forde Moneychanger system

The Forde Moneychanger (“1M”) isa -stahd alone foreign currency calculator that
operates indupendently fiom Horizon, {t performs a vatiety of functions including:

# calculating the sterling value of foreign purrency held,
® keeping a running check on stuck levels; and

# providing information for da:ly and weekly accounting reporting. details of which
are required to be entered manually inte Horizon,

Horizon and the Forde Moneychanger system operated. independently, and it was
necessary for foreign currency transferred into or avi of the: post office to be entered
separately into the Forde Moneychanger arid Horizon.

This iiputting would be’ performed independently and could be done at different times,
resulting in the potential for differences to arse between the tivo systems.

Calculation of the alleged theft

Background

As noted al paragraph 1.12 Mr Page has been charged with the theft of £262,000 in
sterling from Post Office Limited between March 2002 and January 2003.

Summary of alleged theft - 14 January 2003 audit report

An internal audit was undertaken at Rugeley Post-Office on 14 Jenvary 2003 and a
shortfull of £282,000 was eventually identified by the Post Office audit team,

The alleged theft of £282,000 r¢ lates to a shortfall identified specifically in the “Formgn
Currency Sterling Equivalent” figure recorded in the "AM" stock uait of Horizon. No
such curtency was found by the audit team during their audit. I undetvtand that Mr Page
accepts that no such amount of forcign currenvy was fuund at that time m:Rugeley Post
Office.

Mr Page demes thai the deficiency arase as:2 tesuit of theft by tum.

‘Inflation’ of the ‘Foreign Currency Sterling Equivalent’ figure in
Horizon

Pahibit MP/6.entiibiied by Mr Patel illusuates kow the alleged deficiency (or ‘inflation’
per Mr Patel) of £282,000 accumulatid over ime.

‘The inflation referred to by Mr Patel is simply the difference beween the “Forsign

Currency on Hand’ figure.as recorded in Horizany by Rugeley Post Office and. the *ster!ing

eynivalent foreign currency on hand’ figure as identified from the weekly Forde
Moneyvhanger*Command 10” printouts.

Exhibit MP/6..shows that the first period where there was a Significant inflation in the
“Foreign Currency Sterling Equivalent” figure in Horizon was in the weck unded 26 Junie
2002 (Week 13) when ihe amount Is said to be indlated by £53.378.03.

In the two weeks ended 3 and.17 fuly 2902 (Weeks 14 and 16) the infation figure is
negative, One of the negative ‘inflation’ figures is explained.as‘being the result of typing

an incorrect revaluation figure into Horizon but there is to apparent explanation for the
other negative inflation flyure iv. the week ended 3 July 2002 (Weel: 14). This
demonstrates that as’ Hotizon and the Forde. Moneychanger were not integrated,
differences could arise a3 a fesult Of manual inpulting errors.

The next significant inflation in the ‘Foreign Currency Stérling Equivalent’ figwe is
shown in the week ended 31 July 2002 (Week 18) when the inflated figiire per MP/6 is
£177,500, T have not seen a copy of the ‘Command 10’ printout for this period. It is not
clear to me wiiether it 1s alleged by the Prosecution that the theft by Mr Page had reached
£177,500 by this date.

Exhibit MP/6 indicatcs. that, from the week crided 28 August 2002 (Werk 22), the
Horizon “Forcign Currency Storing Eguivalent’ figure was inflated. initially’ by
£188,000. and increasing to £282,060 by the date pf the intemal audit on 14 January 2003
(Week 41),

How was the alleged theft concealed?

‘the Prosecution’s. Qpening Note states that cash, in sterling, was stolen by Mi Page over
a period of time and, from the week ended 25 August 209? (Week 22). this was conceaivd
by Mr Page routinely inflating the Horizon computer records in -relation. to fereign
currency Feld inthe Rugeley Post Oflice “AM” stock unit.

I also note from the Prosecution’s Opening Note. that, some lime prior ta Week 22. the
alleged thei: by Mr Page is allyged to have been concealed by overstating the amount of
“Overnight Cash Holdings’ (*ONCII") ‘hicid at Rugeley as. opposed jo: the “Foreign
Currency Sterling Equivalent’ figure in Horizon,

Thave seen no evidence regarding the alleged theft concealment via the “ONCH” digure,
including as to how and whén any such concealment was undertaken prior 16 the -week
ended 28 August 2002 (Week.22). Lriote that the Roval Mail Icicy dated 22 February
2006 to ty instructing soliviters states That there are“... difficultics im assessing tte true

position of the cash? stock held when aciipnlared aevounts are presented”.

Prior to Week 22

Tf it is alleged that by the week. ended 31 Siily 2002 (Week 12) the thef hud reached
£177,300, and that it was beng concealed ither by overstating the trve.toreign currency
balance or the ‘ONCH! figure. thea. in my opmuion, there is an uncaplained meonststerty
in the Prosecutions case as set out below.

Firstly I note that in the two weeks ended 14 and 2] August 2002 {Weeks 20 and 21), the
inflation figures as stated by Mr Patel (see Exhibit. MP/6) are ml, end therefore no
concealment is attributed 10 this item,

Secondly J note thai the recorded “ONCH" figure (see Weekly Cash Accoumts) for the.two.
weeks ended 14 and 21 August 2002 was only £79,810.00.and £91,240.69 respectively.
afd therefore they could not be overstated by £177,590

regarding methods of concealment other than {he overstatement of the “ONCH* or

‘Foreign Cunency Sterling Pquivalent’ figures m Horzon,

Sheek 22 onwards

1 agree with Mr Patel that as fiom. the week ended 28 August 2002 (Week 22) the
Horizon ‘Foreign: Currency Sterling .Fquivelent® figure was inflated, imally by
£188,000, and jnerecsing t@ £222,000 by the date of the dudit on 14 January 2603 (Week

the ‘Command 10° prints have not been made available (and where according to Mi Patel,
the figurés were obtained from Chesterfield).

Audit process

Thave reviewed a copy of the edit of Accounts” section fromthe Audit Process Manual
(version dated 4’ May 2002).

appear that rione of the other figures in ihe Weekly Horizon Cash Accounts would have
heen checked or verified to any other source documentation as port of the audit. La
addition & number of “Cempliance Tests” may also be undertaken in relatiun io Post
Office procedures and cuntrals,

The Post Office avdit team would firstly ascertain the number of individual stuck units
operated at the sub-post office and obtain an overall. “snapshot for the whele post office
and a ‘snapshot’ for each individual stack unit. The sub-postmasicr would be asked to
make all cash and stock on hand available which would be checked against amounts
revorded in Horizon,

Wher vouchers had been despatelied by the sub-post office these would not be checked
at the time of the audit. Any errors jound subscyuently m the documentation despatched
‘by the post office prior to. the audit would be dealt with by way of ar ‘ortor notice’.

to the concealment of an alleged theft, This difference appears to have urisen as a resuit

Farther evidence of Mr Robert Davies — witness statentent dated 18 February 2006

Lnoie that the Prosecution have now provided further evicence in respect ef the June
2002 audit,

‘The shortfall identified at the time is analysed as follows.

* “BU" bureau stock unit surplus reporied £191,192.95

» “AM” stock unit shortfall teported (£145.873 74)
® Shortfall im the bureau cash and stock held (£ 54,285, 40)
e Other difterences (£369 38)
Total (£._8,335,63)

Mr Davies now states that three cheques totalling £139400.00 (emg cheques for
£80,124.22, £49,.689.44 and £9,586,24 respectively) were included in the Week 13 Cash
Account figures, being the week ended 26 June 2002

Qn the basis «f' the accounting evidence made available to me, 1 agree with Mr Davies”
conclusions that the tao larger of the three- cheques which he refers to should not have
heen inchided m the Horizon account for the weck ended 26 June.2002 and henec the
shortage as calculated by the audit team should be mereazed by £129,812.66 (480,124.22
plus £49,689.44),

‘| would however note that it is not possible for me now to check whether or not the
amounts ‘verified” at thé audi( were correet as the audii process is largely one of simple

asset verification.

However, if the above rater was the oaly ‘error’ in the June 2062 audit then the revised
deficit in the Weekly Cash Account should, as Mr Davies states, be inareased to
£138,149,29.

5.8.1 Based on-a review of the evidence provided it -has not been possible for me to confirin
whether a shortfall.as alleged was concealed in the ‘ONCH* figure in Horizon as these
figures were never (other than in the two audits noied above) the subject of an audit,

of the other figares ia Morizon. They siniply indicate that ‘the figures set out in the

Summary and conclusions

My overall conclusions

In summary I note the following:

ip

Tayree with Mr Patel that as trom the week ended 22 August 2002 (Week 22) the
Horizon “Foreign Currency Sterling Lqutyalent’ figure was inflated, initially by
£188.00, and increasing to £282,090 by tho date of the audit on 14 January 2003
(Week 41),

Tagree with Mr Davies (witness statement duted 18 February 2036) that, on the
basis of the accounting evidence ayailable, the shortage in the audit of 27 June
2002 should be increased by £129.813.66, aid possibly by a further £9 886.34;

‘The alleged deficiency of £282,500 in the AM” siock unit at 14 January 2003
docs not necessarily indicate theft by Mr Fage - any such shortfall could in
practice be the result of other unidentified criors or differences in Monzon,

It is implictt in the Prosecution’s case that, by. simply stating that the £282,000
shortfall in, the “AM stovk urit equates to-4 theft of the saise amount, all other

figures in Horizon (except for the differences identified at the audit) were correct.
Thave' seen a0 evidence that this us‘ fhe case and would ‘also note the bigh

incidence of ‘errors’ as set out in Section 5.7.
‘The Prosecution rely on the assumption that the figures in Horizon we these

reourded by Rugeley Post Orfice staff themselves and that the Horizon system
was working correctly throughout the indictment period:

It is now not possible to establish whether the declared. ‘ONCH* figures were
coitectly recorded im Horizon as they were not independently checked at the time
other than at the two audits;

{f it is alleged that by the week ended 31 July 2002 (Week 18) the theft had
reached £177,500, and thot it was being concealed cither by overstatmg the-tiue
foreign currency balance or the "ONCH’ figure, then, in my opinion. there is ar:

unexplained inconsistency if the Prosecution’s ease, This is because jn the two
weeks ended 14 and 21 August 2002 (Weeks'20 and 21). the inflation. figures a8
stateed by Mr Patel are nil and the recorded ‘OINCH' figures were only £79.810.60
and £91,240,69 respectively, and therefore they vould not be overstated by
£477,500,
