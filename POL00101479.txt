Subject: RE: Call with Paula

Left a message today. Paula is out on GRO} this week. They're going to see
whether she can fit ina call with me some time next week (!). The Defence Team
Representative (Belinda Crowe) wanted to know what I wanted to speak to Paula
about (the weather maybe?). I gave her a broad outline but obviously I want to
have a person-to-person quick call with Paula not to have some intermediary

intercept/interpret/dilute/relay. Will persevere.

Best regards, Ron

Thanks Ron ~ this is important, and we’re grateful to you.

Subject: Call with Paula

Hi Ron
Things here are starting to speed up and I wonder whether you had managed to have a word with Paula yet. We are

getting calls from journalists and James will need to say something soon, but wants to talk to Paula first. Can you let me
know when you have scheduled a phone call with her please?
