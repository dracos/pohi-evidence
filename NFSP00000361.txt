Dear Colin
Losses & gains

Thank you for your letter in respect of the above, I look forward to receiving the views of the
National Executive when they are available.

As discussed over the phone the policy should have been amended to cover how we deal
with subsequent losses as the current policy could be deemed punitive.

My proposal for secondary losses is as follows. If a subpostmaster has a subsequent loss then
they shall make good the subsequent loss immediately, However if the subpostmaster is not
ina position to repay the sum immediately they have the following options :

* Make good the previous loss and re-pay the subsequent loss over a 12 month period

* Amalgamate the remainder of the first loss art total of the second loss and repay an
increased amount over the remaining term of the first loss.

* Inextreme hardship cases the two losses can be amalgamated and re-paid over a 12 month
period.

The retail network manager is the final arbiter of repayment terms for subsequent losses. If
there is a further loss during this period this must be re-paid immediately.

Lhope the above helps to clarifies this issue.

_ Yours sincerely
