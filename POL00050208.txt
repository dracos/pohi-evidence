in looking at the line and eventually we had to take the fax machine out throw it
away and get a new one in provided by Mr. Khanna and now it seemed to work but
there was a time there when it wasn't so slow, it wasn't so good. People using

cards just weren't getting through.

RD What period was that?
PH | suppose 9 month ago for 3 month.
RD So we're talking about the beginning of this year, December?
PH Yeah I'm not very good with times but yes possibly.

RD Ok so what does typically Doreen do?

PH Everything until we get to the point where there's only the paperwork to be printed

by the computer, all the forms, all the reports are done between us.

RD So who would declare the cash?

PH Whoever's there really it doesn’t necessarily have to be me but it could well be
Doreen.

RD Right what about stock?

PH | declare the stock | spend the afternoon working my way through that until it’s all
on.

RD And what about the rest of, all the bits of paperwork weekly reports etc who does
that?

PH Well that’s done between us until they're all finished and when you press the button

on the computer you sit and wait for a while until it does what it's doing with the

little egg timer turning and eventually it prints the reports.

14,50 PH explains the computer program is really slow at the end of the day taking up to
1 and half hours. He continued that Doreen leaves about 6.30pm with him staying

PH No I'm a simple guy | can only remember one number and it's a number I've used for

PH No.

RD But if you didn’t realise how much it was up why is there a second cash declaration
for 46,400?

hoped it was something that the computer had done or hadn't done and | was waiting
for error notices and it got out of hand.
RD They'd have been back long before now Peter you're an experienced Subpostmaster

so you know they'd have been back

PH You're still getting error notices a year back they don't come back as quick as that.

‘on every month?
PH Erm I've done cash variances every so often and there’s been 3 or 4,000 maybe and |

still keep hoping that it was going to be something coming back from Horizon with an

error notice,
RD Why didn’t you tell Sunil about these?
PH Basically because if you tell them the shit's going to hit, | know the shit's hit the fan

already but they're not the easiest guys to talk to. His elder brother is a, | mean!
