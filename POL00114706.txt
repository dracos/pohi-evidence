Subject: MR JULIAN WILSON, ASTWWOD BANK, FAD 346 246
Dear Both,

I noticed in the letter from Shoosmith’s that there was a remark about having the Horizon Kit replaced.
However on everything that I have looked at, this is not apparent.

I know the channel to go through for this information but I suspect that Investigations may have already
got this information because of their own enquiries at the time of the prosecution.

Do you want me to follow this up?

Please advise.

Regards,
