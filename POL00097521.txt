All

You have received an invitation for a meeting next Thursday, 3pm in 148, where we will kick of our response to the
Second Sight Spot reviews. It is important that that everyone makes it to the meeting in person. (Rod, I still need a
P&BA representative — for the meantime I have invited Alison, but wait confirmation on who this should be)

I will reiterate these points at the meeting, but some ground rules we need to follow:
1. The information we are dealing with is confidential. Please do not communicate the content of the work
outside our working group — if you need others in your department to help you, please run it by me first.
2. We need to take each allegation seriously and respond in a fact based manner. You may feel that some of the
allegations are wild, emotive and unfounded, none the less, we need to provide a measured, factual response.

3. We need to approach these reviews with an open mind, if we (Post Office or our systems) are at fault or have
weaknesses, we need to be open and transparent. Taking a defensive stand will not help us.

I have only received one spot review from the investigators to date. I am expecting several more by Friday. I will email
them out in advance of next Thursday to give you time to think about the best way of responding to them.

Look forward to meeting you all next Thursday.

Regards, Simon
