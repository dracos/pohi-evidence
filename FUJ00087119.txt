Pete,
Could you pick this up please?

Bill should start to get involved I feel as this is developing into a audit by drop feed which we should discuss separately as
need to get some additional funds and a cr to cover.

Another query:
Based on your response below:

“Once created, branch transaction data cannot be changed, only additional data can be inserted. If this is required,
the additional transactions would be visible on the trading statements but would not require acknowledgement /
approval by a sub-postmaster, the approval is given by Post Office via the change process. In response to a previous
query Fujitsu checked last year when this was done on Horizon Online and we found only one occurrence in March
2010 which was early in the pilot for Horizon Online and was covered by an appropriate change request from Post
Office and an auditable log. For Old Horizon, a detailed examination of archived data would have to be undertaken
to look into this across the lifetime of use. This would be a significant and complex exercise to undertake and
discussed previously with Post Office but discounted as too costly and impractical.”

¢ Who from POL raised the change request?;

¢ Could any further documentation/evidence be provided to give context for what process was followed in this
instance of the balancing transactions tool being used in this instance? This may include change management
evidence such as scoping, testing, sign off/approvals etc.

Regards,
Sean

Subject: RE: Strictly Private & Confidential - Subject to Privilege

Rodric,
Please see Fujitsu’s response below.
Summary:
e There is no ability to delete or change records a branch creates in either old Horizon or Horizon online.
Transactions in both systems are created in a secure and auditable way to assure integrity, and have either
a checksum (Old Horizon) or a digital signature (Horizon Online), are time stamped, have a unique sequential

number and are securely stored via the core audit process in the audit vault
e Whilst a facility exists to ‘inject’ additional transactions in the event of a system error, these transactions
FUJ00087119
FUJ00087119

would have a signature that is unique, sub-postmaster id’s are not used and the audit log would house a
record of these. As above, this does not delete or amend original transactions but creates a new and
additional transactions

This facility is built into the system to enable corrections to be made if a system error / bug is identified and
the master database needs updating as a result, this is not a unique feature of Horizon

Approvals to ‘inject’ new transactions are governed by the change process, 2 factor authentications and a
‘four eyes’ process. A unique identifier is created and can be audited for this type of transaction within HNGX,
Horizon would require more extensive work to investigate as explained below.

1. Can Post Office change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change? No

2. Can Fujitsu change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change? Once
created, branch transaction data cannot be changed, only additional data can be inserted. If this is required,
the additional transactions would be visible on the trading statements but would not require
acknowledgement / approval by a sub-postmaster, the approval is given by Post Office via the change
process. In response to a previous query Fujitsu checked last year when this was done on Horizon Online and
we found only one occurrence in March 2010 which was early in the pilot for Horizon Online and was covered
by an appropriate change request from Post Office and an auditable log. For Old Horizon, a detailed
examination of archived data would have to be undertaken to look into this across the lifetime of use. This
would be a significant and complex exercise to undertake and discussed previously with Post Office but
discounted as too costly and impractical.

3. If not, where is the evidence for this conclusion? See Answer 2

4. If so:

a) Howdoes this happen? See above

b) Why was this functionality built into the system design? To allow for data to be corrected if there
were any defects found in the system

c) Why would Fujitsu need to use this functionality? As above and under instructions from Post Office
Ltd.

d) What controls are in place to prevent the unauthorised use of this method of access? This is achieved
through a number of industry standard controls (RBAC, 2 factor authentication etc) which are
robustly audited under ISO 27001 / IAS 3402, Link, PCI.

e) When has branch data been accessed in this way in the past? See above

5. In relation to the Winn/Lusher email:

a) What is "message store"?This is the repository (or database) where all transactions were written to
in the old Horizon system

b) Can this be used to access and change branch records? /t can be used to access the records. Data
cannot be changed, but new data could be inserted into it. Any such inserted data would be tightly
controlled by operational processes explained above.

c) What is the "impact" of this change on branch records? The impact would depend on exactly what
records were inserted.

d) Would the subpostmaster be aware of this change? Yes, via the trading statement but spm’s are not
required to approve the change, this is provided by Post Office.

e) Why would this method of access be used? To correct errors if a software defect is identified.
f) What controls are in place to prevent misuse of this method of access? As above.

Subject: Strictly Private & Confidential - Subject to Privilege

James,

Could Fujitsu please answer the questions below so that we can respond to a specific challenge put to us by Second
Sight in connection with a Mediation Scheme complaint, namely that:

"the Andy Winn/Alan Lusher email in the case of Ward [...] explicitly states that Fujitsu can remotely change the
figures in the branches without the SPMs’ knowledge or authority".

The Winn/Lusher email is attached. The part of the email in question is:

“Fujitsu have the ability to impact branch records via the message store but have extremely rigorous procedures in
place to prevent adjustments being made without prior authorisation - within POL and Fujitsu these controls form the
core of our court defence if we get to that stage.”

Questions:

6. Can Post Office change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change?

7. Can Fujitsu change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change?

8. If not, where is the evidence for this conclusion?

9. If so:

a) How does this happen?
b) Why was this functionality built into the system design?
c) Why would Fujitsu need to use this functionality?
FUJ00087119
FUJ00087119

d) What controls are in place to prevent the unauthorised use of this method of access?

e) When has branch data been accessed in this way in the past?

10. In relation to the Winn/Lusher email:

a) What is "message store"?

b) Can this be used to access and change branch records?

c) What is the "impact" of this change on branch records?

d) Would the subpostmaster be aware of this change?

e) Why would this method of access be used?

f) What controls are in place to prevent misuse of this method of access?

Please let me know if it would be easier to address these in a phone call in the first instance.
Kind regards, Rodric
