Subject: Cartwright King Training
Helen,

I’ve spoken with Martin and he would like to deliver some training around awkward interviewees, significant
statements, points to prove, interviewing techniques, etc.

Can you raise as AOB at next weeks SOLT meeting ... I'm looking at you, Keith and Darrell nominating
those in your teams that would benefit from this piece of activity.

I suggest this is applicable mainly to our recent starters and perhaps those who are relatively
inexperienced or those that Team Leaders feel would benefit.

If you can collate names and I'll then liaise with Martin for some suitable dates.
Probably looking at central England again, depending on the names put forward.

Regards,

Dave Posnett I Accredited Financial Investigator
