Subject: Meeting with Brian Altman QC [BD-4A.FID20472253]

Chris

I look forward to meeting you tomorrow at the meeting with Brian Altman QC which will take place at 16.00 hrs at his
chambers at 2 Bedford Row. I have sent a link of the location to Amanda for your benefit.

I also attach a draft copy of Brian's forward looking report dealing with a review of POL's prosecution role. Whilst this
is still marked "draft" it is in effect his final form report. I have been liaising with him today over a few issues which he
has now addressed.

Could I please ask you not to circulate this report internally at POL. After the meeting with Brian I will send the final
report to you.

Kind regards
