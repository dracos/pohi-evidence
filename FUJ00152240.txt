[the transfer causing the problem was started while the user was attached to
lsu BDC. The user then managed to attach to SU MC before completing the
transfer (I think this is probably another result of a known problem whereby
lyou can get out of the foreign currency pick list without being forced to
settle the transfer - being fixed at $60).

so the transfer was really from BDC to MM, but the EPOSSTransfers object
thinks it is from MC to MM. This inconsistency is preventing the transfer
from completing and from being reversed.

I've spoken to the PM and asked him not to balance stock units BDC, MM or MC
jantil we have sorted out the problem. I'm loading up the messagestore on a
test counter and hope that by amending the EPOSSTransfers object it will then
be possible to reverse the transfer.

i've made a messagestore correction (OCR AChambers31310) to remove the
transfer. Before and after messages attached. Have spoken to PM and informed
him he should be able to continue with the balance now.

ffice last rolled over 2 weeks ago so it is likely to take him several hours
I please contact him in the morning and make sure it went ok.
