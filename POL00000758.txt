Abstract
This document:
e was jointly produced by ICL Pathway and POCL;

e was reviewed, validated and approved by the EPOSS
Reconciliation Panel;

e describes the results of work that was carried out during the
period December 1998 to April 1999;

e focuses on:

e observed EPOSS exceptions which could affect the accounting
processes carried out within post office outlets and POCL
central functions;

e the local resolution of exceptions;

e the raising of incidents when exceptions cannot be resolved
locally;

¢ resolution of the incidents.

Exceptions may be caused by user error, reference data error ,
hardware failure, communications failure or software error.

Process definitions for automated payment reconciliation and
reference data error management are detailed in separate
documents (see associated documents in section 0.3). This
document concentrates on EPOSS products, stock unit balancing
and cash account production at Horizon enabled offices using
release NR2 software. For completeness some information is
provided for OBCS.

In most situations the ability to reverse transactions facilitates
the resolution of accounting exceptions at the outlet.

This document includes all EPOSS related exceptions which have
been identified to date and the planned method of handling
them. It is recognised that other incidents may arise during live
trial. If any new unexpected incidents occur in the future they
will be investigated by the appropriate authorities and the
relevant processes will be amended to accommodate the new
incident types.

Stock unit and cash account balancing at the outlet provides an
opportunity to reconcile cash, stock and receipts with the Horizon
system (electronic) view of the outlet’s financial accounts.
Wherever possible exceptions relating to differences between the
electronic records held within the Horizon system and the
supporting documentation are resolved locally at the outlet. This
action is expected to eliminate the vast majority of identified
exceptions.

Management & Resolution 16/06/99

Date:

Reconciliation also occurs within POCL Transaction Processing
when the electronic cash account information is compared with
supporting documentation.

Other levels of reconciliation exist, e.g.:

e within POCL Client organisations - comparisons between
settlement information provided by POCL and information held
within the client organisation;

e by customers of POCL clients - observed missing payment on bill.

The existence of the POCL client and customer “reconciliation”
processes is recognised within this document, in so far as calls
made by POCL Clients to the Transaction Processing Error Team.
However, no detail is provided on the POCL Client internal
processes.

Exceptions which cannot be resolved locally within outlets are
raised as incidents with the appropriate helpdesk. At release NR2
Horizon enabled outlets will be supported by the existing ICL
Pathway Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH) and the new POCL
Network Business Support Centre (NBSC). A set of principles are
included in this document which describe the scope of each help
desk and the key help desk interactions at NR2.

Within this document exceptions and incidents that are directly
related to the reconciliation of accounting information are described
in detail. Summary information is provided for incidents that relate
to (a) help desk advice and guidance, (b) incorrect operation of
hardware, comms. or software, (c) file transfer errors and (d)
reference data errors.

This document will be maintained under change control for the life
of release NR2 and updated when appropriate to reflect information
gained from live trial.

5 Principles for EPOSS Reconciliation Incident
Management and Resolution

The following principles were used in the development of the
Release NR2 EPOSS end-to-end reconciliation process. Changes to
the principles may necessitate the review and revision of the
processes detailed within this document.

Note 1: Within this document the term “exception” is used to
describe an exceptional situation that occurs locally within an outlet
or within the POCL TP (Transaction Processing) organisation.

Note 2: Within this document an “incident” is deemed to have
occurred when an exceptional situation is reported to and recorded
by either the ICL Pathway HSH (Horizon System Helpdesk), the
POCL NBSC (Network Business Support Centre) or the Incident
Management Point within POCL TP.

Note 3: The general principles below include the initial handling of
reference data errors because there is a significant interaction
between reference data and EPOSS system functionality. In
exceptional circumstances an incident may be initially thought to be
a POCL reference data error but later found to be an error within the
ICL Pathway domain. It is also possible that an incident may
initially be thought to have been caused by an error within the ICL
Pathway domain but later found to be a POCL reference data error.
Both these situations require secondary routing of the initial
incident. Details of this is provided within the Reference Data Error
Management process - ref. CS/PRD/046.

5.1 EPOSS Reconciliation Process Design Principles

P1 Outlets will, wherever possible, eliminate user errors before
raising an incident.

P2 POCL TP Incident Management will, wherever possible, eliminate
human error and errors within POCL systems before raising an
incident with ICL Pathway.

P3 Wherever possible, EPOSS related incidents that have accounting
reconciliation implications or an impact on the outlet business
processes will be predefined so that they can be easily identified
and routed to the correct resolution point.

P4 For each predefined incident category there will be an agreed
“initial incident management contact point”. In the case of
outlets this will either be the ICL Pathway HSH or the POCL
NBSC. Outlets will not be advised to contact both. In the case
of POCL TP the initial contact point will be POCL TP Incident
Management.

Management & Resolution 16/06/99

Date:

P5 Incidents reported to the HSH that are defined as “EPOSS
Predefined Business Incidents”, indicating that there are ICL
Pathway reconciliation implications, will be routed to the ICL
Pathway BSU (Business Support Unit). A category of “new” will
be used for unexpected incidents that are shown to have EPOSS
reconciliation implications. Following investigation, valid new
incidents will be added to the list of EPOSS Predefined Business
Incidents. NB: There are currently no EPOSS Predefined
Business Incidents identified. However, if any are identified
during live trial they will be investigated and if valid added to
the list of predefined business incidents. This principle and
principles P6, P7 and P8 will then apply.

P6 The BSU will investigate EPOSS predefined business incidents
and report findings on an EPOSS RED (Reconciliation Exception
Database) Report (see NB in P5).

P7 EPOSS RED reports will be distributed to a defined single point
within POCL (see NB in P5).

P8 POCL will define a single point for the receipt of EPOSS RED
reports (see NB in P5).

PQ Outlets will be advised to report detected Horizon system
hardware or communications incidents directly to the ICL
Pathway HSH.

P10 Outlets will be advised to report incidents that are likely to have
been caused by a Horizon system software error directly to the
ICL Pathway HSH.

P11(a) Outlets will be advised to report incidents that are likely to
have been caused by an error in the POCL reference data
(regardless of where the source of the error actually is) directly
to the POCL NBSC.

P11(b) Outlets will be advised to report incidents that are likely to
have been caused by an error in the ICL Pathway reference data
(regardless of where the source of the error actually is) directly
to the HSH.

P12 In situations where an incident could have been caused by
either a POCL reference data error or a Horizon system software
error, the incident will initially be treated as a potential POCL
reference data error, i.e. incident raised with the POCL NBSC.

P13 In situations where a key outlet business process is impacted
by an unresolved incident of any type, the outlet will be advised
to contact the POCL NBSC for advice and guidance.

P14 ICL Pathway and POCL will work together to ensure that the
advice and guidance information provided by the HSH and the
POCL NBSC is compatible with the knowledge and culture within
the outlet.

Management & Resolution 16/06/99

Date:

P15 Where appropriate, ICL Pathway technical domains will trigger

the raising of an EPOSS predefined business incident, e.g. when
an ICL Pathway technical incident is shown to have caused
EPOSS reconciliation implications.

P16 Where appropriate, the ICL Pathway BSU will trigger the raising

of a technical incident, e.g. when an EPOSS predefined business
incident suggests that there might be an underlying ICL Pathway
software error.

P17 Both the HSH and NBSC will conform to the principles described

above. If an outlet makes a call to the HSH which relates to
P11(a), P12 or P13, the call will be treated as inappropriate and
the outlet will be advised by the HSH to call the NBSC. If an
outlet makes a call to the NBSC which relates to P9, P10 or
P11(b), the call will be treated as inappropriate and the outlet
will be advised to call the HSH. If either help desk starts
handling a call because it initially appears to be appropriate, but
then finds that it is the responsibility of the other desk, then the
help desk handling the call will inform the outlet that they are
referring the call to the other help desk, terminate the call with
the outlet and inform the other desk. The other desk will
contact the outlet and continue advice and guidance and/or
resolution.

P18 Both the HSH and NBSC will take action to avoid outlets being

passed backwards and forwards between the two help desks. If
when calling a help desk the outlet mentions that they have
already been referred from the other help desk, then the help
desk taking the call second will take control of the call and
interact with the other desk to agree how the incident will be
progressed.

OBCS Incident Management

Some information on OBCS is included in this document because:
¢ OBCS is accounted for within EPOSS;
e information on OBCS is not included in any other reconciliation

related documentation.

Incidents related to OBCS have been included in this document
where they are detected by the user. OBCS related incidents are
present in section 9.1.3.

Summary

7.1 EPOSS Reconciliation Related Exceptions Detected
Within Post Office Outlets

The following provides a summary of the categories of exception
which may be detected within a post office outlet and the action
taken. Specific exceptions are discussed later in this document.
Exceptions become incidents when they are reported to and
recorded on either the POCL incident management system (TP
Incident Management at Chesterfield or NBSC at Leeds) or the ICL
Pathway HSH. The handling of EPOSS reconciliation related
incidents within POCL and ICL Pathway is described in sections
entitled POCL Incident Management and ICL Pathway Incident
Management at the rear of this document.

7.1.LImpacted Accounting Processes

8.2 Process Descriptions

NB: References 1, 2 and 3 were previously used for BPS processes,
which are now no longer relevant.

Processes 4, , 5 and 6 - Reference data processes

These processes describe how product and outlet reference data is
manage - see ICL Pathway documents CS/PRD/030 (product) and
CS/PRD/050 (outlet). References data error management is
described in CS/PRD/046.

Process 7 - Control APS

Includes the APS functionality provided within the Horizon system -
see ICL Pathway document CS/PRD/044 for further information.

Process 8 - Control OBCS
Includes the OCBS functionality provided within the Horizon system.
Event A - Customer requests service

Includes requests for automated payment and/or EPOSS
transactions. Also includes enquiries relating to automated
payment and/or EPOSS transactions.

Process 9 - Complete customer session (OBCS/APS/EPOSS)

A session comprises one or more OBCS, APS or EPOSS transactions.
Included are transactions completed using the automated features
of the Horizon system, e.g. card reader, bar code reader, receipt
printer, etc.. Also included are transactions completed when
peripheral equipment is temporarily unavailable. In these
situations the outlet enters transaction details via the keyboard,
prepares manual receipts, etc.

An expanded view of the Complete Customer Session process is
provided within this document in section entitled Lower Level
Models.

Further details are available in POCL business process diagrams :

APS - 1/8/16

OBCS - 10/9/11/6/4&5/1&2

Process 10 - Complete customer session (fallback)

If the Horizon system is unavailable, e.g. PC hardware failure, the
outlet reverts to manual operation. The manual receipts and
counter-foils used during fallback are used later when recovery
(process 11) is carried out.

Event B - Outlet triggers recovery

Transactions completed in fallback need to be entered into the
Horizon system when the system returns to normal operation.
Recovery can be completed as soon as the system is available or
when the user has time to enter the transactions. However,
recovery must be completed before the end of the Cash Account
Period.

Process 11 - Recover fallback transactions

Transactions processed during fallback are entered to the system as
part of the recovery process. AP has a recovery modes for this
purpose. EPOSS transactions are entered in bulk or individually.

An expanded view of the Recover Fallback Transactions process is
provided within this document in section entitled Lower Level
Models.

Further details available in POCL business process diagrams :
Integrated Service - 48
Process 12 - Maintain EPOSS records

The system maintains a log of all the transactions performed in the
outlet which is updated as the transactions are entered to the
system. The transaction log can be accessed at any time to assist
with enquiries or to perform other activities in the stock unit, e.g.
reports, balancing, transaction reversals, etc.

Event C - Automatic end of day marker set

At the end of the trading day (either 30mins after office closing or
7pm) an accounting marker is set which indicates the end of the
trading day for the outlet - see ICL Pathway document CS/PRD/044
for further information.

Process 13 - Manage end of day

The end of day marker indicates the end of the outlet trading day.
The setting of the end of day marker prevents the reversal of
automated payment transactions performed during the day. A
manual end of day activities facility can be selected by the user.
This displays the outstanding mandatory daily activities for the
stock unit.

Date:

This process includes the communication of transaction details from
post office outlets to the ICL Pathway correspondence servers,
onward communication to the central ICL Pathway systems and
then on to the POCL TIP and HAPS system interfaces.

An expanded view of the Maintain/Communicate EPOSS and APS
Records process is provided within this document in section entitled
Lower Level Models.

Process 15 - Reconcile and settle

This process includes the receipt of the information which makes up
the Cash Account, validation against volume/value and storage for
various purposes (e.g. RMMI (Royal Mail Management Information)).
When the full week’s data has been received it is then reported to
CBDB.

TIP receives the cash declaration from the outlets which forms part
of the snapshot balance and supports the information which
appears on the Cash Account. TIP does not receive daily/weekly
reports or stock unit balances. TIP only receives the outlet cash
account.

TIP also receives STX records which are stock holdings per item on
hand at the end of the accounting week. The information is used to
reconcile and settle with each client.

The information is received on a daily basis (between 8.00am and
15.00) by File Transfer Protocol (FTP) from the gateway PC.

An expanded view of the Reconcile and Settle process is provided
within this document in section entitled Lower Level Models.

Process 16 - Consolidate and reconcile automated payment
records

AP transactions accepted at the outlet are polled on a daily basis
after the end of day marker has been set. The information is sent
via HAPS to Farnborough who sort the data into clients. The
information is forwarded to settlements so that payment can be
made to the client.

Further details are available in POCL business process diagrams :
APS - 3

The information received from Farnborough updates APACHI and is
compared to the entry on cash account by outlet. Discrepancies
discovered are investigated and corrected within Transaction
Processing.

See ICL Pathway document CS/PRD/044 for further information.
Process 17 - Maintain automated payment records

POCL clients receive automated payment transaction information
from Farnborough. Clients use this information to support
settlement processes.

mandatory daily reports. The user checks that the report agrees
with the actual documents, amends if necessary and despatches
the documents with the supporting report.

Event G - End of balance period for stock unit

On transfer of accountability of a stock unit or at the end of the
cash account period (CAP) all stock units have to be balanced.

Process 21 and 22 - Balance stock unit and roll-over

The purpose of balancing is to assess the state of the stock unit by
confirming the entries on the Horizon system against the
documents, cash and stock on hand. Once the user confirms that
the balance is accurate the stock unit is rolled into the next BP or
CAP depending on what is required by the user/outlet. The impact
of rolling the stock unit removes the transaction information from
the stock unit, carrying forward the cash and stock on hand to the
next accounting period.

Stock units may be individual stock units or shared stock units.

An expanded view of the Balance Stock Unit and Roll-over process
is provided within this document in section entitled Lower Level
Models.

Further details are available in the POCL business process
diagrams :

EPOSS - 37/59/39/58
Event H - End of cash account period

The cash account is a summary of all the transactions performed
within the outlet during the accounting week and a declaration of
cash and stock on hand at the close of the accounting period. The
accounting period is usually one week and the account is therefore
produced weekly.

Process 23, 24, 25 and 26 - Balance cash account and roll
over

The cash account is an amalgamation of all the stock unit balances
for the outlet. When the cash account is completed and produced
the outlet moves forward to the next cash account period (CAP).

Cash accounts usually cover one week. However, by exception
cash accounts may cover two or three weeks. A final cash account
is produced when an outlet changes ownership or when an outlet is
temporarily or permanently closed. An initial cash account is used
when an outlet migrates to the Horizon system.

process is provided within this document in section entitled Lower

Cash Accounts can span a period of more than the Cash Account
Period. This occurs when the sub-postmaster is absent and unable
to complete the account this could be for various reasons (e.g.
holidays) but is planned with permission from the Retail Network
Manager and Transaction Processing. There are occasions however
when this may occur without being planned (e.g. urgent domestic
distress) although permission is still required.

Final Accounts are the last Cash Account that an outgoing sub-
postmaster completes before the business is transferred to the
incoming sub-postmaster. The transfer can happen at the end of
the Cash Account Period (CAP) and will therefore mean only one
Cash Account is produced in the CAP. If the transfer occurs mid-CAP
then 2 Cash Accounts will be produced for one outlet during the

CAP.

error. If this does not resolve the
incident NBSC raises an incident with
HSH.

This could be reference data or

EPOSS should not omit figures where
there is a volume/value check set up.

Not expected under EPOSS. TP would
not expect any value amounts to be

would clear any user error. If this did
not resolve the error an incident will
be raised via the TP Incident Manager

raises an incident with HSH.

This is expected under EPOSS e.g. a

9.13 Maintain Payment Records (POCL Client) - Process
17 on End-to-end Model

This section is included for completeness. The processes used by
POCL clients are not affected by the introduction of Release NR2.

POCL clients compare transaction level information provided by
POCL with settlement information. If there are differences the POCL
client would raise a query with the POCL Error Management Team in
Chesterfield. Valid queries would trigger an adjustment to
settlement. This is shown in section 9.12.1 (expansion of process
15) where client queries are received by process 15.3 (manage
errors) and error notifications are sent to process 15.2 (settle with
clients). Valid POCL client queries would lead to an incident being
raised by POCL TP Incident Management. If the POCL investigation
showed that the incident was caused by an underlying error within
the ICL Pathway domain, then POCL TP Incident Management would
raise an incident with the ICL Pathway HSH.

In addition. a customer could raise a query with a POCL client if a
difference was observed between their personal records and the
bill/statement provided by the POCL client. If an investigation by
the POCL client indicated that the root cause was within the POCL
domain, then the POCL client would raise an incident with the POCL
Error Management Team in Chesterfield. The process would then
progress as described in the paragraph above.

10 POCL Incident Management and Resolution
Processes for EPOSS Related Incidents

EPOSS incidents are handled by two organisations:
e NBSC (Leeds);
e TP Incident Management Point (Chesterfield) linked to the NBSC.

The NBSC provides advice and guidance for business issues, e.g. for
situations where outlet business process are impacted by an
unresolved incident of any type. The NBSC also handles POCL
reference data related incidents raised by outlets or POCL TP.

The TP Incident Management Point records incidents occurring
within TP and raises incidents with the ICL Pathway HSH or the
NBSC.

process while awaiting resolution of incident

If the down time exceeds one day the

Daily Summaries

When the system is down at end of day the
outlet must complete manual versions of the
required daily summaries. On resumption of
the service, the outlet must, if applicable,
recover those transactions necessary and
complete a system summary and cut off. This
system produced summary can then be
discarded.

Weekly Summaries

As part of the fallback process for Cash
Account production, the outlet in the case of
system / power failure will not be required to
complete a Cash Account until the following
week. In this Scenario, no weekly reports will
be required.

In the event of printer failure, the outlet must
preview the reports on screen until the printer
service is restored. On resumption of the
service, the outlet must select the reprint
functionality and forward the reports
immediately to TP.

1. In the event of printer failure, the user
should preview the stock unit balance. On

report in the outlet.

2. In the event of system / power failure then
the outlet will be asked by the NBSC whether
they have balanced sufficient SUs to operate a
service on the following day. If they have then
there is no issue. The outlet simply continues
in fallback mode, and on restoration of the
service completes fallback recovery of any
outstanding transactions. When operationally
feasible, the outlet will then balance any
outstanding SUs from the previous CAP.

If however, no SUs have been balanced then
the outlet will be instructed to suspend

Pathway _— Process For Release NR2 - Incident Version 1.0

Management & Resolution 16/06/99

Date:

The vast majority of EPOSS related incidents handled by ICL
Pathway concern the operation of the EPOSS service, e.g. Horizon
system advice and guidance, hardware incidents, communications
incidents, software incidents. These types of incidents do not
normally have accounting reconciliation implications.

The main focus of this section is the management of incidents that:
¢ have accounting reconciliation implications;
e require ICL Pathway BSU involvement in resolution.

The preceding diagram shows four categories of incidents. Each of
these is discussed below.

11.1.1 EPOSS predefined business incidents

NB: No incidents of this type are currently identified. However, the
capability of handling EPOSS predefined business incidents is
included in the Pathway NR2 incident management processes.

Wherever possible EPOSS incidents that involve reconciliation of
accounting information by the BSU are predefined so that they can
be easily separated from other incidents, clearly labelled and
routed to the BSU by the most direct route. Within ICL Pathway
EPOSS incidents that have accounting reconciliation implications
are known as “EPOSS Predefined Business Incidents”. These
incidents include a category of “other” which can be used if new
unexpected incidents are encountered. Following investigation and
resolution, the new incident is added to the list of predefined
business incidents so that it can be dealt with effectively if/when it
is encountered again.

Predefined business incidents may be reported to the HSH by post
office outlets, POCL TP incident management or ICL Pathway
organisations. The HSH routes predefined business incidents to the
BSU via the SMC.

All predefined business incidents are added to the RED
(Reconciliation Exception Database) by the BSU. The BSU
investigates the incident and reports findings via a RED report.

11.1.2 General Horizon system advice and guidance,

hardware, communications, software and file transfer
related incidents

These incidents form the majority of incidents handled by the HSH.
Incidents are either resolved by the HSH during the initial call, e.g.
Horizon system advice and guidance, or routed to the appropriate
technical expert domain for resolution. The SMC filters known
errors.

Advice and guidance associated with the operation of the Horizon
system is provided by the HSH at the request to post office outlets.
Hardware, comms. and software incidents associated with the

Date:

counter systems are reported by the post office outlet directly to
the HSH. Incidents associated with the operation of Interim TIP
interface are reported to the HSH by TP Incident Management
(Chesterfield).

11.1.3 Reference data errors

Post office outlet queries relating to prices, product information, and
other POCL reference data type information are initially handled by
the POCL NBSC. The NBSC checks reference data and resolves any
errors that have occurred within POCL domain. If POCL perceive
that the reference data error was caused by an underlying error
within the ICL Pathway domain, the NBSC raises a reference data
incident with the HSH. The HSH routes the incident to the SMC
where checks are made to see if the error was cause by a “transient
known error” e.g. late delivery of reference data or a
communications problems. If this does not explain why a reference
data incident has occurred the incident is routed to the ICL Pathway
expert domain (System Support Centre) for further investigation.
The further investigation, where appropriate, involves the ICL
Pathway Reference Data Team. A detailed description is provided in
ICL Pathway process definition document CS/PRD/046.

11.1.4 BSU raised system incidents

The BSU raise a system incident with the HSH if they perceive that
a specific system error has occurred. They raise a problem is a
trend is observed.

11.2Inappropriate calls from outlets

The HSH will consider the following calls to be inappropriate:

e calls relating to situations where a key outlet business processes,
e.g. cash account rollover, is impacted by an incident of any
type;

e calls relating to price, product or other POCL reference data type
queries.

The HSH will advise the outlet to contact the NBSC.

NB: If the HSH starts to provide advice and guidance to an outlet or
starts to diagnose an incident raised by an outlet, but then
discovers that it is an incident that is normally dealt with by the
NBSC, the HSH will inform the outlet that it is referring the incident
to the NBSC, terminate the call with the outlet and inform the NBSC.
