POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF ROBERT IAN PEAPLE

|, ROBERT IAN PEAPLE, will say as follows:
INTRODUCTION
1. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the
“Inquiry”) with the matters set outin the Rule 9 Requestdated 7 July 2022 (the
“Request’). It primarily relates to the initial procurement process for
computerization of Post Office counters. There is also a section relating to Royal

Mail's prosecution policy.

PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND

2. | joined Royal Mail as a graduate entrantin 1967. After spellsin operations and
planning in the field together with a posting to HQ Training Division (where Iled
the team devising and implementing Decimalisation training). In 1972 | was
awarded a Post Office Scholarship to study for a MBA at Manchester Business
School. Subsequently had roles in Finance, Tariff Pricing, Marketing, and

Personnel.

In 1982 1 was promoted to the newly formed Counters Division. This subsequently
became Post Office Counters Ltd (POCL). My initial remit was Finance Director.

In that role | introduced financial accounting consistent with company status for
the newly created POCL: established a management accounting process enabling
the profitability of individual outlets and revenue streams to be determined; and
led on negotiations with the Treasury and Govemment Departments to move from
cost-plus pricing to more commercial, arms-length, relationships. Atmy own
request | then moved across to become Personnel and Industrial Relations

Director.

. Around 1993! was asked to lead for POCL in negotiations with the Benefits

Agency to establish a joint approach to procuring technology at Post Office
counters; to Chair the Evaluation Board considering Supplier options; and,
subsequently, to set up a joint POCL BA implementation team.

In 1997 | was asked to retum to Royal Mail as their Director Personnel and

Industrial Relations. At this pointmy involvementwith the project ceased.

PROCUREMENT

6.

In this section | address the questions raised by the Inquiry solicitors. My

responses are based on the 26 documents supplied.

. The initial impetus for this project arose from the decision of the BA to cease

paper-based Welfare payments. The BA had determined that this would reduce
fraud and costs. For POCL, this threatened their major revenue stream. For

Subpostmasters ,this would potentially mean loss not only of income from POCL

but also in their private businesses due to reduced customer footfall and
customers having reduced cash in hand.

8. At this time it was considered that a card based payment system could meet all
the parties’ objectives.

9. Against this background | was asked to lead for POCL in discussions and
negotiations with BA to establish a joint understanding of the means by which the
separate objectives could be achieved. (Throughout the Subpostmasters’
representative body — the NFSP- was informally kept abreast of the approach and
progress).

10.The process of reaching an understanding was constructive but, given the
complexity of the issues involved, took considerable time. However, by April 1995
the parties had reached agreement as set outin DWP00000001
[WITN0402_01/1] Memorandum of Understanding between BA and POCL.

11.In accordance with Government policy at this time the procurement was to be
made ona _ PFi basis.

12. From the early stages, it was determined that implementation of the project would
require a dedicated team. It was further determined that this should be a joint
BA/POCL team drawing in staff with appropriate skills from both organisations.
The appointed joint team leader reported to me on the POCL side whilst, in tum,
reported to a joint BA/POCL Steering Group co-chaired by the Chief executives of
the two organisations.

13. This was a major project involving many issues. The documents supplied by the

Inquiry demonstrate the careful, and extremely thorough, approach adopted. They

also demonstrate the use of extemal expertise in the financial , technological and

legal aspects of the project.

14. This Inquiry relates to events nearly 30 years ago. It would be irresponsible to
pretend to remember all the detail from that time. However, and based upon the
documents supplied, | make the following observations :

(a) Clear evaluation criteria were drawn up relating to technical efficacy, financial
robustness (potential Suppliers and intemal business cases),commercial risk,
operational ease, customer acceptability and longer term system development
potential;

(b) Inevitability in a project of this size issues did arise but there were clear
processes for resolving these;

(c) Potential suppliers were kept fully informed of the project requirements and the
aspects of their bids that did not meet these. This allowed suppliers to alter
their proposed approach before final bidding. It enabled “sticking point” issues,
eg the Pathway proposed funding structure, to be satisfactorily resolved;

(d) My role as Evaluation Board Chairwas to ensure that the Evaluation criteria
were comprehensive and soundly based; and that the final recommendation
could be demonstrably justified against these criteria:

(e) The final recommendation of the Evaluation Board in the choice of supplier
was unanimous (see POL00031153 [WITN0402_01/2)):

(f) The Business case to proceed was then subjectto detailed scrutiny by
Authorising Authorities in POCL, Post Office Group, BA , and the DHSS (

including clearance by the Treasury).

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
15.1 cannotfully comment on this aspect as | do not recall the detail. However, as
stated in POL00031271 [WITN0402_01/3] a formal structure for organisation and
control of the change programme was established. Standard change
management practice at that time included Risk Registers and how these were to

be addressed.

PROSECUTION POLICY
16. The documents supplied relate primarily to the Royal Mail policy. This policy had
been carefully worked up by my Deputy Director and, as such, itis probable that |
cleared the approach and delegated its implementation to him.
17.1 do not know how the Royal Mail approach was modified and implemented in

other Business units within the Post Office Group.

SUMMARY.
18. The Evaluation process for this initiative was exhaustive and based upon best
practice at the time as deployed in Govemment and The Post Office Group.
Extensive use was made of external consultants to ensure that approach adopted
was robust and that all aspects of the evaluation had been properly considered.
19. | have not been able to find any evidence thateither the evaluation process was

flawed or that the criteria laid down within itwere not rigorously evaluated.

CONCLUSION

20. This is my witness statement.
