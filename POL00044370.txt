Statement of Information

1) I, Michael Francis Matthews a financial investigator currently employed by Post Office
Ltd, am accredited under Part 8 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 but I am not accredited
under Part 2 of the act so I rely on the Prosecutor to tender this statement. This statement
of information is further to the statement of information made by Robert George Wilson,
Solicitor in this matter, in accordance with Section 16(5) of the Proceeds of Crime Act

2002. I say as follows:-

2) Iam duly authorised to make this statement of information on behalf of the prosecutor,
who is the Solicitor to Royal Mail Group Plc, Criminal Law Team and who has conduct of
the proceedings in this matter. I make this statement of information in accordance with

Section 16 (6) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.

3) Oyeteju ADEDAYO, hereinafter call the defendant has accepted that she has benefited

from her particular criminal conduct, however disputes the amount of benefit.

4) On the 5" of September 2005 an audit was undertaken at Rainham Road Post Office,
which identified a shortage of £52,864.08. The shortage was due to the fact that the branch
should have had cash and stock on hand to the value of £100,546.44. It actually had cash
to the value of £41,611.35 and stock to the value of £6,071.01 a total of £47,682.36.

Total cash and stock due to Post Office Ltd £100,546.44
Actual cash at branch £41,611.35
Actual stock at the branch £6,071 .01
Shortage £52,864.08

5) After the audit the branch was closed and the cash was dispatched to a Post Office Ltd
Cash Centre and the stock was dispatched to a Post Office Ltd Stock centre to be
accounted for. Unfortunately the cash dispatched to Cash centre was not accounted for a
period of some months, as it should have been. As a result a notice was sent to the
Rainham Road Post Office branch requesting that they check their records as the Cash
Centre were querying a discrepancy of the sum of £41,611.35. This matter has now been

rectified but the defendant seems to have confused this discrepancy of £41,611.35 with

her audit shortage. This administration error does not detract from the fact that the Branch

was short at audit by the figure of £52,864.08.

6) Following the audit The Defendant was interviewed on the 5" of September 2005 and
admitted that between June and August 2005 she had removed £50,000 from the Post
Office. She indicated that the money had been used to pay her creditors until she had
arranged the remortgage of her property. She admitted inflating the cash figure on her cash

accounts.

7) The Defendant has pleaded guilty to offences of False Accounting. The benefit to the
Defendant as a result of the fraud is £52,864.08. This is the amount of the audit shortage
additionally It may be agreed that the defendant would have had to pay interest on a
commercial loan of £50,000 a sum similar to the additional shortage of £2,864 .08

between June 2005 and today’s date from the money that she took.
