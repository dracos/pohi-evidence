Dear Sir

REGINA v SEEMA MISRA
GUILDFORD CROWN COURT
TRIAL - W/L 1°" - 12" JUNE 2009

I have received a telephone call from Jon Longman the Investigating Officer who:
took over this case from Adrian Morris. Counsel will recall the Defence letter
dated the 16" March 2009 which advised that the Defendant would plead Guilty
to all counts relating to false accounting but Not Guilty to theft.

Counsel will also recall that subsequent to that by letter dated 9" April 2009 the
names and addresses of 3 people who worked at the Sub Post Office at various
times were notified to the prosecution. Jon Longman has attempted to contact
these people and has attended their addresses. None of them now live at the
addresses given and one is believed to now be living in India.

Bearing in mind the matters which the Defendant set out on pages 13 and 14
(Exhibit bundle) Jon has asked whether it would be in the public interest to
continue with the prosecution.

Myself (or Jarnail who is also aware of this) would appreciate Counsel's advice
as to whether or not it would be sensible to continue with the prosecution or to
accept the false accounting charges.

I look forward to hearing from Counsel.

Yours faithfully

Phil Taylor
Legal Executive
Criminal Law Division
