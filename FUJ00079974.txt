Fujitsu POA Customer Service Policy Manual Ref: CS/QMS/oo1
Version: 2.0
Company In Confidence Date: 14/09/05

1 Introduction

This document forms part of the Fujitsu POA CS Quality Management System.
It provides policy guidelines to support the definition of the CS business
processes.

The CS business is considered to be divided into a number of key process areas,
see Process Blueprint [ref. 1] for detail. The information contained within this
document defines the policy guidelines that relate to the operation of the CS
business processes and the CS external interfaces.

2 Scope

The scope of this document mirrors that defined in the CS Process Manual, see
[ref. 1] for detail.

3 CS Process Policy

The CS process policy distinguishes between policy guidelines, business process
definitions and operational procedures.

3.1 CS policy guidelines

Policy

a) CS will record and maintain the policy guidelines that are required to
support the development and maintenance of CS business process
definitions in a CS Policy Manual.

b) The CS Policy Manual will be recorded on PVCS.

3.2 CS businesy procesy definitiony

CS business process definitions have the following characteristics:

a) they are owned and authorised by nominated members of the CS
Management Team;

b) they show the inputs to and the outputs from the CS business;

c) they show how the process inputs, e.g. incidents, problems, complaints, etc.
flow through the CS business and describe the major activities performed;

d) they provide a maintained framework to support the evolution and
optimisation of the CS organisational structure, roles, responsibilities and
business effectiveness.

e) they provide a maintained framework for the development of operational
procedures.

f) they define the current (as is) situation or a planned future position.

Policy

a) CS will develop and maintain a CS Process Blueprint. The CS Process
Blueprint will contain high-level definitions of the key CS business
processes. The CS Process Manual will be recorded on PVCS but is
primarily accessed via a Web page on the CS Intranet.

b) Where there is a business case for holding additional process information,
CS will develop and maintain additional cross-referred lower-level business
process definitions. These will also be recorded on PVCS.

3.3 CS operational procedurey

CS operational procedures have the following characteristics:
a) they relate to a particular CS organisational unit;

b) they are owned and authorised by the CS line manager responsible for a
particular CS operational unit;

c) they describe how activities are currently carried out within a particular CS
operational unit;

d) they include exception handling and escalation procedures.

In the context of this document operational procedures also includes CS work
instructions.

Policy

a) CS line managers will develop, implement and maintain operational
procedures and / or work instructions for all business activities that are
carried out within the business area they are responsible for.

b) CS operational procedures and / or work instructions will be recorded on
PVCS. Alternatively, they may be recorded on a CS Intranet site. However,
if this option is chosen, CS line managers must put in place local procedures
to ensure that:

~ current versions of operational procedures and / or work instructions are
published on the CS Intranet site;

— their staff know how to access current versions of operational procedures
and / or work instructions;

— security is in place to safeguard the procedural information published on
the CS Intranet site;

— a capability exists to quickly access (within 1 hour) the procedural
information from an alternative source, if the electronic data on the
Intranet site is lost.

7 Incident Management

Incident Management provides a controlled environment for the resolution of
day to day events that interrupt normal operation of the systems, services and
procedures within the live operational environment. Incident Management
also provides:

a) triggers for problem management;

b) triggers for the application of business continuity plans;
c) onward routing of unresolved complaints;

d) service data for reports.

A large part of incident management is subcontracted to Core Services. The
exceptions are third line software support, which is handled by the Fujitsu POA
CS System Support Centre (SSC) and the handling of business incidents, which
is managed by the Fujitsu POA CS Management Support Unit (MSU).

Incident

An incident is an individual day to day event, within the live environment,
which is reported to the Fujitsu POA single-point-of-contact, ie. the HSD.
Incidents may also be reported to the POL single-point-of-contact, i.e. the
NBSC. Incidents may be transferred between the HSD and the NBSC.

Where there is any chance of confusion, incidents are more tightly defined as
“live incidents”.

To avoid confusion, “incidents” that occur in the pre-live environment are
always referred to as “pre-live incidents”.

The main incident types include:

a) requests for advice and guidance;

b) reported faults or failures in equipment, software, services or procedures;
c) reported user errors;

d) reported complaints;

e) situations which need to be recorded for audit trail purposes.

Temporary procedure (TP

A TP describes the actions to be taken when specified types of incident are
encountered. TPs are developed by the appropriate expert domain within
Incident Management and are recorded on a Known Error Log.

incident and communicate the incident to the NBSC.

7.3 Linking incidents passed between desky

Policy

a) If the HSD wishes to transfer an incident to the NBSC, the HSD will retain
ownership of the incident until the NBSC accepts the incident.

Problem
Problem is the term used for an adverse situation that is:

(a) caused by a defect in the specification, design, production, implementation
or use of any of the service components

(b) substantial enough to warrant action to eradicate it. A problem may be
indicated by a trend of incidents. Problems are deemed to exist when they are
recorded on the Fujitsu POA CS or POL Problem Management Databases.

Managers.

b) Problem notifications will result in a problem being raised, the assignment
of an unique reference number and the logging of the problem on the
Fujitsu POA CS Problem Management database.

c) Cross-domain problems, i.e. problems that require the involvement of both
Fujitsu POA CS and POL, will be logged on both the Fujitsu POA CS and
POL Problem Management databases. The Fujitsu POA CS and POL
problem references will be cross-referred.

d) All problems reported by POL will be recorded on the Fujitsu POA CS
Problem Management database, irrespective of any initial judgement
relating to Fujitsu POA’s required involvement.

Business continuity plans detail the actions to be taken when the end-to-end
service is interrupted.

Major Business Continuity Incident (MBCI)

MBCIs are a special type of incident, which are raised in response to the
reporting to the HSD of a major failure or disruption in the end-to-end service.
MBCIs are routed to the Fujitsu POA CS Business Continuity Manager and act
as a trigger for the application of pre-defined business continuity plans.

changes to current systems / services, the results of which will be used to
identify the level of contingency required.

e) develop business continuity plans to meet the contingency requirements.

10 Service and Performance Reporting

Service and performance reporting identifies the level of performance of
systems and services in the live operational environment. Until the roll-out
programme is completed it also includes implementation reporting.

12 Change Management

There are two main types of change, i.e. ad hoc change and predefined change.

Ad hoc change uses POL raised Change Requests (CRs), Fujitsu POA raised
Change Proposals (CPs) and Fujitsu POA raised Contract Change Notices
(CCNs). The ad hoc change process is well established and managed within
Fujitsu POA by the Programme Office.

Pre-defined change uses agreed change mechanisms, i.e. Operational Business
Change, to make changes without the requirement for POL to raisea CR. There
are two types of OBC, i.e. product change and outlet changes.

13 Software Release Management

Policy

a) Planned software releases will be communicated to POL via a weekly
release schedule and daily release notifications.

b) Software release to the live environment will be controlled by Fujitsu POA
CS authorised Release Notes.
