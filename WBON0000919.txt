Amended statement attached. Having re-read the statement, this looks like a pure typo to me.

Kind regards

I think Ron is right. The double negative doesn’t make much sense. Can we get it amended?

Thanks Simon.

Looks as though there's a typo in the final sentence of the following para:

The programme that was being tested at the time would also not have generated any REMs. This is used
where there is a transfer of stock to or from head office. This was not relevant to the current project and so I
do not believe there would not have been any test REMs generated.

I don't think there should be a double negative there.

Best regards. Ron.
