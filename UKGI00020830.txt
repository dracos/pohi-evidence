toll Was my first victory though ;)

Exactly. There’s probably 10 or so we can think of and fill an hour. Even I couldn’t stretch ATMs and VOA to an hour!

I was trying to think about that but drew a blank after State aid and sparrow. Not sure the things below warrant a whole
meeting but agree these are good bite size chunks we could put in to a longer meeting along with say community
branches, stakeholders viewpoints, etc

Ideas welcome.

Also it might be good for us to put our heads together and have a chat about other issues Tom should be aware of...
such as VOA and ATMs, POca and DWP relationship, etc. I’m sure there are a few more but this is good colour to some of
the challenges and dynamics POL has to face.

Marcus — can you put an hour in the diary for the four of us to talk. We can call it “Other POL Issues” or something
suitable ominous!

OK, thanks.

You'd benefit from a state aid meeting then (from Tim assisted by Nick). Laura and I are scheduling a sparrow meeting.
Otherwise I think the meetings below do the trick, although I would get the NED meetings scheduled reasonably sooner
simply because they are always busy on other parts of their portfolio.

Please could Marcus arrange the state aid meeting with Tim pls?

Tom
Where are you up to on your induction re POL? It occurred to me yesterday that we probably need to brief you on state
aid and how that impacts on POL and what it can and can’t do, but have you had sessions on Mails, Government

Services, Telco, supply chain and the like over at POL?
