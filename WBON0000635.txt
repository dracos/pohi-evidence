Gideon - These are fine.

Dave / Victoria — between you, please can you let the witnesses know the general nature of the questions they will
get.

Gideon - two other points.

What are we doing about the Stubbs defence that refers to docs from Paul Williams that Paul did not send? This is not
a problem with Paul's evidence but a mistake by the legal team in preparing the Defence so I think we need to own up
to this.

I'm really not comfortable that the Judge has a clear understanding of how SPMRs can dispute either transactions
corrections or end of trading period shortfalls. We could pick this up with Angela?

Thoughts?

Subject: Examination in chief

All,

Please see attached the 2 documents we are currently intending to present as typo-corrections for our
witnesses.

There are a number of other points which will be canvassed in examination in chief rather than by written
correction, because they are (a) new evidence and/or (b) more involved than a typo correction. Currently, we
have questions for Beal (clarifying which hotline was 24 hr); Haworth (clarifying which checklist he used,
and mentioning the CoA for the Crossflatts branch); Trotter (explaining why he didn’t go through the
contract in his first interview with Dar); and Van Den Bogerd (giving figures on how many branches, both
generally and of the Cs in this case, are run by (a) companies and/or (b) multiples).

The additional points for examination in chief which arose today were for Longbottom (explaining the nature
of the 2 page balancing guide, and that it was not a replacement for the manuals) and Ridge (explaining that
there were 2 different Christines with different jobs).

Please let me know if there are any queries, internally or from the witnesses, on what will be covered.

Thanks

Gideon
