RMGA Operations Incident Management Procedure

Fe)
FUJITSU

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

1 Introduction

1.1. Owner

The owner of the Incident Management process at the local RMGA account level is the Fujitsu RMGA
Service Delivery Manager responsible for Incident Management within the RMGA account.

1.2 Objective

The objective of this document is to define the procedure for Incident Management in the RMGA
environment. The procedure is the local implementation of the Fujitsu corporate Incident Management
process (C-MSv1.3). Reference to process in this document is within the contet of the corporate
document C-MSv1.3. For the purpose of this document an Incident is defined as:

“Any event which is not part of the standard operation of a service and which causes, or may cause, an
interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that service.”

The quality of the service includes the protection of the confidentiality of business, personal and card
data as defined by the RMGA Information Security Policy (SVM/SEC/POL/0003).

The document applies to all Incidents raised by the RMGA HSD or by SMC (out of hours or from
systems monitoring tools), where they are related to the Fujitsu outsourcing contract. N.B calls presented
to RMGA HSD / SMC that should be placed with the NBSC are transferred/ referred from RMGA HSD /
SMC to NBSC.

The scope of the process is from the receipt of an incident by the HSD / SMC, through to the successful
workaround or resolution of the incident.

For clarity, it should be noted that the HSD / IMT are responsible for managing/owning Incidents during
business hours, while SMC assume this responsibility out of hours.

The key objectives of the process are (C-MSv1.3)

Log, track and close all types of incident requests

Respond to all types of incident requests

Restore agreed service to the business as soon as possible

Resolve incidents within the target timescales set for each priority level within the Service Level
Agreement(s)

Resolve a high number of requests at first contact

Ensuring incident priorities are linked to business priorities

Keeping the user informed of progress

Reduced unplanned downtime

Improved Customer satisfaction

eoee

1.3 Process Rationale

The primary goal of the Incident Management process is to restore normal service operation as quickly
as possible, thereby minimising adverse impact to the business. In turn, this ensures the highest level of
service quality and availability. Normal service operation is defined here as service operation within
Service Level Targets (SLT).

This process takes account of the requirements of improved service to be delivered to POL, through the
introduction of the HSD / SMC. The implementation of the IMT is documented and is aimed at

2 ‘Inputs

The inputs to this process are:

e All Incidents reported by Contact with the HSD / SMC. Contact is defined as voice or Tivoli Alert as
the methods of communication with the HSD / SMC and fall into the following categories:

°
°
°
°
°

°

Business process error

Hardware or software error

Request for information e.g. progress of a previously reported Incident
User complaint

Network Error

Logging via HNG-X web interface

« Severity and SLT information.

¢ Evidence of an Error.

e System Alerts received automatically from transaction monitoring tools. Due to the urgent nature of
some of these alerts, they may be dealt with directly by SSC, with an update of workaround or
resolution supplied to HSD / SMC. It should be noted that these alerts enter the process at step 3,
and are not subject to steps 1 & 2 of this process.

Risks and Dependencies

3.1 Risks

The following define the risks to the successful delivery of the process:

Break in the communications chain to third parties. Mitigation is to invoke escalation procedures.
Non-availability of the HSD / SMC Incident Management System. Mitigation is given in the HSD /
SMC Business Continuity Plan.

Non-availability of the OTI links to core & external service desk tools.

Lack of information given to the HSD / SMC regarding changes, POL Business updates, request for
changes, status of Problems etc. Processes must be followed to lessen this risk, such as the
Change Management and Problem Management Processes.

Unavailability of sufficient support unit staff

Unavailability of sufficient tools for Incident diagnosis

Non-availability of KEL or call management systems

The provision of inadequate staff training within the HSD / SMC, SDU's or 3” party suppliers
Unavailability of systems for evidence gathering.

3.2 Dependencies

This process is dependent on:

Effective Incident handling by the HSD / SMC.
The known error information being available and kept up to date with all errors as the root cause
becomes known to Problem Management

e Knowledge database kept up to date with POL business and services knowledge

e Fujitsu infrastructure support of the HSD / SMC tools

e Appropriate training plans / skills transfer of desk agents.

e Appropriate training needs to include hardware, software and networks support staff, SDU's and 3°
party suppliers

e Effective routing of calls to SDUs and third parties

« Effective escalation procedures and the maintenance thereof within Fujitsu, POL and third parties

e Governance of Incident / Problem Management procedures

« Effective feedback to POL through Service Management ORFs, contributing to end user education
and reduced Incident rates.

« Internal feedback to improve the Incident / Management Process.

e SLT and OLA knowledge and understanding across all Fujitsu and 3 party support

* RMGA, SDU and 3” party consistent co-operation in incident identification and resolution

2.2 Call Severity is assigned based on the impact and urgency as per the criteria in the table
below. Call Priority for Hardware and Network calls is assigned in accordance with the Priority
matrix as detailed in Engineering Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0002), a copy of which
each agent should have on their desk.

Severity I Importance I Definition

A Critical * BUSINESS STOPPED, a Post Office unable to trade (where engineering cover
available), unable to process any business, or central system failure which will result in
a number of Post Offices being unable to process work.

* Causes significant financial loss (as agreed between POL and RMGA Operations)

* Results in data corruption or unrecoverable data loss.

B Major + BUSINESS RESTRICTED, a Post Office restricted in its ability to transact business
€.g. 50% of counters unable to trade or trading with restricted business capability,

+ Has an adverse impact on the delivery of service to a number of end users.

+ Causes a financial loss that impacts POL and/or RMGA reputation (as agreed between
POL and RMGA Customer Services)

+ Ifa PCI Major Incident process is invoked

¢c Medium + NON-CRITICAL, a Post Office working normally but with a known disability, e.g. an
interim solution (workaround) has been provided.

* Ifa PCI Minor Incident process is invoked

+ Has a minor adverse impact upon the delivery of service to a small number of end
users

D Low + Non-urgent

‘* Insignificant and usually cosmetic error, either a trivial documentation error or spelling
error on the system

2.3. If the incident is considered a Major Incident as defined in SVM/SDM/PRO/0001 Major
Incident Process, the Major Incident Procedures are invoked.

2.4 The HSD / SMC agent then attempts to resolve the Incident using the resources available.
This starts by interrogating the HSD / SMC knowledge database to find all information related
to the Incident symptoms. If the Incident is routine, i.e. there is a predetermined route for
resolution, then the Incident is resolved on the call or referred to the relevant SDU using the
HSD / SMC Support Matrix.

2.5 If the Incident is not routine, the HSD / SMC agent checks for Known Errors listed in the SSC
KEL against records relating to the Incident symptoms. If a match is found, the agent informs
the caller of the workaround or resolution available.

2.6 If there is no match in HSD / SMC knowledge database or the SSC KEL, the HSD / SMC
Incident Management System stack is checked for current incidents outstanding. If a match is
made, the caller is then advised of the status of the incident and the master record is updated
to reflect the current occurrence.

2.7 If no match is made against the HSD / SMC Incident Management System stack, the HSD /
SMC continues with first line resolution of the Incident assisted by the Product Support
Engineers (PSE's). IMT are appraised of the position.

2.8 If the PSE’s cannot resolve the Incident, it is referred to the relevant SDU using the HSD /
SMC Support Matrix. IMT are appraised of the position. For Hardware calls, the caller is given
an indication of engineer arrival time, based on the SLA associated with the priority of the call.

2nd line support stage. The referred SDU investigates and diagnoses the Incident, based on
information already taken by the HSD / SMC, together with any new information. The SDU also
coordinates where sub-contract third parties are involved. If the Incident has no associated KEL, or
it is complex and involves multiple SDU'’s, or if it has been unresolved for an extended period, the
IMT will alert the RMGA Service Delivery Manager to the existence of a pattern likely to produce a
Problem.

Out of hours, SMC should check the OLA documentation to determine if out of hours support is
available for the Service impacted. In the event that out of hours support is available, SMC will
discuss incidents with the Duty Manager, who in turn will discuss incidents with the line of business
SDM.

4.1 A workaround or resolution is produced by the SDU.

4.2 The SDU then either applies the workaround or resolution or passes it to the HSD / SMC to
implement. The Master Incident Record (if one exists) remains open at this point

4.3 The SDU checks the workaround or resolution has been successful. HSD / SMC are
responsible for updating details recorded in HSD / SMC knowledge database, from details
supplied via the KEL created by SSC. HSD / SMC knowledge database should be identical to
SSC KEL in relation to Application Software, but may also contain additional information.

4.4 Where this Incident has a number of Calls referenced to it, or where there is a probability that
proactive action is required to prevent further occurrences of this Incident the IMT will alert the
RMGA SDM to the existence of a pattern likely to produce a Problem

5.1.5 Step 6: Ownership, Monitoring, Tracking and Communication
Responsible: HSD / SMC, SSC

Throughout the Incident, the HSD / SMC retains ownership for monitoring and keeping the call raiser
informed of progress, unless the incident is specifically software related, in which case SSC hold the
responsibility for confirming details of closure.

The HSD / SMC manages the complete end-to-end Incident process.
Activities include:

e Regularly monitoring the status and progress towards resolution of all open Incidents

e Note Incidents that move between different specialist support groups, indicative of uncertainty
and possibly a dispute between support staff

e Give priority for Incident monitoring to high-impact Incidents

e Keep affected users informed of progress without waiting for them to call, thus creating a pro-
active profile

e Monitors SLT and escalates accordingly. If an Incident has no associated KEL or, it is complex
and involves multiple SDU'’s, or if it has been unresolved for an extended period, IMT will alert
the RMGA SDM to the existence of a pattern likely to produce a Problem.

e Updating HSD / SMC ONE from information supplied from SSC KEL. This may be applied as a
direct copy or amended for use by the agents, dependant upon the technical complexity of the

update.

9 Appendix A: Security Incident Reporting

9.1 Scope

This annex outlines the process regarding the investigation, and reporting of all security incidents
concerning the HORIZON Network and all IT equipment.

9.2 Aim

The aim of these instructions is to ensure that details of all IT related security incidents are reported to
one central point and that any follow up investigations are managed in an efficient and auditable manner.

9.3 Changes

These work instructions are primarily for use by HORIZON Service Desk Staff, the RMGA Security
Team, the POL Security Team, and SSC staff. Approval from POL is to be gained before any significant
changes to the work instructions are implemented. All readers are encouraged to propose changes to
Work Instructions, in writing, to the RMGA Security Manager.

All incident documentation is subject to review and update by the business continuity and information
security teams as part of the lessons learnt process following an incident and following the annual review
of the incident process as part of business continuity.

9.4 POL Incident Handling Guidance

All POL incidents will still be handled in accordance with existing POL guidelines. This document does
not replace these, or, indeed, replace any part of the content - rather it lays down the RMGA framework
under which the work is carried out.

9.5 IT Incidents

9.5.1 Incident Definition

9.5.1.1. An information security Incident is: "an adverse event or series of events that compromises
the confidentiality, integrity or availability of Fujitsu Services Post Office Account information or
information technology assets, having an adverse impact on Fujitsu Services and/or Post Office Ltd
reputation, brand, performance or ability to meet its regulatory or legal obligations." This will also extend
to include assets entrusted to Fujitsu including data belonging to Post Office Ltd, its clients and its
customers.

9.5.2 Incident Categories

Incidents can be categorised in many ways, they can occur alone or in combination with other incident
categories and can vary significantly in severity and impact. It is important that all incidents are
recognised and acted upon.

RMGA Operations Incident Management Procedure

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

9.5.2.1 For the purpose of illustrating the impact of incidents two levels of severity have been
defined (Note: in practice the assessment may be less straightforward):

A MINOR incident will normally have limited and localised impact and be confined to one domain,
resulting in one or more of the following:

Loss or unauthorised disclosure of internal or sensitive material leading to minor
exposure, or minor damage of reputation

Loss of integrity within the system application or data, leading minimal damage of
reputation; minimal loss of customer / supplier / stakeholder confidence; negligible cost
of recovery

Loss of service availability within the domain, leading to reduced ability to conduct
business as usual; negligible loss of revenue; minimal loss of customer / supplier /
stakeholder confidence; negligible cost of recovery

Individual attempts to breach network security controls shall be treated as a minor
security breach.

Subject to discussions with the RMGA Duty manager due to high volume of calls relating
to the same type of incident it may well be a requirement to follow the RMGA Major
Incident Process (SVM/SDM/PRO/0001) following the advice from the RMGA Duty
Manager.

A MAJOR incident will have a significant impact on the Network Banking Automation Community
resulting in one of more of the following:

Loss or unauthorised disclosure of confidential or strictly confidential material, leading to
brand or reputation damage; legal action by employees, clients, customers, partners or
other external parties

Loss of integrity of the applications or data, leading to brand or reputation damage; loss
of customer / supplier / client confidence; cost of recovery

Loss of service availability for applications or communications networks, leading to an
inability to conduct business as usual; loss of revenue; loss of customer / supplier / client
confidence; cost of recovery

Aconcerted attempt or a successful breach of network security controls shall be treated
as a major security breach.

NB. For a Major Incident the RMGA Major Incident Process (SVM/SDM/PRO/0001) should be followed.

9.5.3 Examples of IT Incidents

Theft of IT equipment / property, including software
Malicious damage to IT equipment /property, including software
Theft or loss of Protectively Marked, caveat or sensitive IT Data.

Actual or suspected attacks on the Fujitsu Services RMGA Network or Information
System.

Potential compromise of systems or services at the Data Centre through evidence
retrieved and presented by Police or POL's card acquirer.

The above list is a non exhaustive list of example. Any other IT related incidents
reported, will be considered and passed to the appropriate authority for action.

9.5.4 Containment

Whenever an Incident is identified which presents a serious threat to conduct normal business it should
be contained and isolated as quickly as possible. This will mean Platforms that appear to have suffered
virus attack or other malicious code attack need to be quarantined immediately to prevent further
spread. It may also be necessary to isolate network connections that appear to be the source for Denial
of Service threats or where they have been subjected to suspected hacking attack.

If the incident relates to card data, the environment may be subject to a Forensic Investigation imposed
by POL's merchant acquirer. In this instance log data will need to be reviewed and analysed.

9.6 Reporting

9.6.1.1 Anyone reporting a security Incident should be encouraged to notify their Line Manager in
the first instance. The Line Manager will gather as much detail of the incident as possible, following
company procedures. He or she will undertake an initial local investigation into the incident, ensuring
that in the case of missing equipment or materials that they have not just been misplaced. Information
gathered will be entered into the initial case report template (ICR).

9.6.1.2 If the severity of the Incident is considered as Minor but warrants further investigation the
Line Manager should immediately log a call with the Horizon Service Desk, stating that they are
reporting a security incident, giving brief details. Please note that in certain cases there may be
circumstances where no details of a sensitive nature should appear on the call log. Having logged the
call and obtained a call reference number, the Line Manager may then continue with the investigation,
and act as a liaison between the person reporting and all concerned parties. Once logged, the
investigation will thereafter be referred to by the Call Number.

9.6.1.3 All Incidents reported to the Service Desk with a call reference and even when classified as
Minor should still be forwarded to RMGA Security Management to determine if there is a Security
Impact. It is important that for any incident investigated the correct procedures are adopted regarding
evidence, as the information collected and recorded may be used for evidential purposes at a later date

9.6.1.4 If the severity of the Incident is considered as Major the Incident details must be reported
directly to the RMGA Security Manager immediately. Contact details are available on Café VIK.
Depending on the type of Incident and the severity of the incident RMGA Security will make the decision
to escalate the details to the POL Security. In the case of Data Centre incidents specifically Security will
also inform the Data Centre Manager if this has not already been done. Regardless of the severity of the
incident, when a compromise in card data occurs the incident must be reported to POL Security so that
POL can comply with it's contractual obligations with it's card acquirer.

9.6.1.5 In all cases relevant details should only be recorded and discussed as necessary between
the person investigating or Line Manager dealing with it and any relevant parties who need to be
included in the investigation. Information on any incident must not be passed to anyone who is not
directly involved with the investigation without the authority of RMGA Security Manager and the POL
Head of Information Security.

9.6.1.6 I Once a call is raised with the SSC the call will then be placed on the call stack of the RMGA
Security Team, who will monitor the incident, assist or advise the Line Manager if required, and be
available to take over the investigation should the need arise, but always be able to respond, within 2
hours of the initial call being made. (Minor Incidents (during normal working hours of between 9am and
5pm) and Major Incidents at all times.)

9.7 Investigation

9.7.1 Policy

Although all security incidents will initially be reported to the RMGA Security Manager in order to have
one point of contact for all parties, some or all of the investigation requirements may be passed to one or
more of the following for further action. The decision of delegation will be determined by the RMGA
Security Manager in association with POL Information Security Incident Manager.

9.7.2 POL Security / Investigation Team

9.7.2.1 In the event that the reporting of an incident is passed to POL Security or the Investigation
Team, all details of the investigation, and final outcome or reference details, should be recorded on the

initial case report (ICR) and details will be recorded in the security Incident Log. It is important that for
any incident investigated the correct procedures are adopted regarding evidence, as the information
collected and recorded may be used for evidential purposes at a later date.

9.7.2.2 In the event that the RMGA Security Manager takes ownership of an investigation, he will
report the results to POL Head of Information Security and POL's Business Continuity Manager.

9.7.2.3. During any investigation the Investigator must comply with the appropriate legislation and
compliance requirements and regulatory or standard requirements.

9.7.2.4 All initial investigations should be carried out at the earliest opportunity and any queries
should be directed to RMGA Security Manager. Investigation must be reliable, stand up to scrutiny and
potential cross-examination and evidence must be properly obtained, recorded and time stamped.

9.7.3 External Investigator

9.7.3.1. Should it be considered necessary the incident might be passed to an external Investigator
or forensics team, who will ensure that any data required for evidential purposes is captured and
investigated using a systematic approach which ensures that an auditable record of evidence is
maintained and can be retrieved. In some cases, where a compromise to card data is involved, two
Forensic Investigation teams may be involved. One team operating on behalf of POL gathering the
required audit logs to use to analyse and investigate the problem. A second Forensic Investigations team
may be imposed to investigate on behalf of the card acquirer and card schemes. In all incidences where
a Forensic Investigation is involved, the Forensic Investigators will be shadowed by POL's Legal and
Security Teams.

9.7.4 Evidence Rules

9.7.4.1 Rules of Evidence

Before undertaking security incident investigation and computer forensics it is essential that investigators
have a thorough understanding of the Rules of Evidence. The submission of evidence in any type of
legal proceedings generally amounts to a significant challenge, but when computers are involved the
problems are intensified. Special knowledge is needed to locate and collect evidence, and special care is
required to preserve and transport evidence. Evidence in computer crime cases differs from traditional
forms of evidence in as much as most computer related evidence is intangible and is in the form of
electronic pulse or magnetic charge, hence the need to use specialist teams. That said the information
collected and recorded from the Operational areas is equally important and must be recorded with due
care and diligence.

9.7.4.2 Types of Evidence
Many types of evidence can be offered in court to prove the truth or falsity of a given fact.
The most common forms of evidence are Direct, Real, Documentary and Demonstrative.

Direct Evidence

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

Direct evidence is oral testimony whereby the knowledge is obtained from any of the witness's five
senses and is in itself proof or disproof of a fact in issue. Direct evidence is called to prove a specific act
such as an eye witness statement.

Real Evidence

Real evidence also known as associative or physical evidence is made up of tangible evidence that
proves or disproves guilt. Physical evidence includes such things as tools used in the crime, and
perishable evidence capable of reproduction etc. The purpose of physical evidence is to link the suspect
to the scene of the crime. It is that evidence that has material existence and can be presented to the
view of the court and jury for consideration.

Documentary Evidence

Documentary evidence is presented to the court in forms of business records, manuals, printouts etc.
Much of the evidence submitted in a computer crime case is documentary evidence.

Demonstrative Evidence

Demonstrative evidence is evidence used to aid the jury. It may be in the form of a model, experiment,
chart or an illustration offered as proof.

9.7.5 Process

In most cases response to a reported incident the initial investigation will be carried out by a nominated
investigator normally the RMGA Security Manager or his nominated deputy. RMGA and POL Security
Teams will be on hand to provide backup and assistance if required. When seizing evidence from a
computer related crime the investigator will collect any and all physical evidence such as the personnel
computer, peripherals, notepads and documentation etc., in addition to computer generated evidence.

There are four types of Computer generated evidence:
e Visual Output on a monitor
e Printed evidence on a plotter
e Printed evidence on a printer

e Film recordings on such digital media as disc, USB stick, log files, tape or cartridge, and optical
representation on either CD or DVD.

The investigator will endeavour to obtain as much original evidence as possible. In the event of a court
appearance the court prefers the original evidence rather that a copy but will accept a duplicate if the
original is lost or destroyed or is in the possession of a third party who cannot be subpoenaed.

9.7.5.1 Following the initial investigation and where considered appropriate, the investigator will
report to/ liaise with the local Police and/or other external Agencies; this will only be done following
consultation with the POL Head of security and POL Head of Information Security or substitute.

9.7.5.2 Copies of the initial and follow up reports will be submitted to relevant authorities and details
of all investigations will be held on file by the RMGA Security to aid any subsequent trend analysis.
