Jarnail,

Thanks for this. Do we take it that we "resist" defence requests in the terms of your email? I would
like formal confirmation bearing in mind the view taken by counsel. If further consultation with
Harry or otherwise would assist please let me know. I will need to reply to Kim Wylie's solicitors this
week.

Regards

Andy

Andy.

Thank you.

Tagree Defence will approach to stay the prosecution until the review by second sight is completed will
become increasingly common. Post office view is that such an approach be resisted. Review to be conducted is
limited in scope in few and isolated cases . Second sight would work with a number of MP’s(two at present) to review
cases that have been raised by their constituents. Second sights appointment is presently being agreed with the MPs and
justice for sub postmasters .There is no legal or forensic grounds to argue defendants will not get fair trial or
abuse of process. There is no reason to justify the case being stayed, The fact that the review is being carried
out is not an acknowledgment that there is an issue with Horizon .the system working properly and is being
used up and down the country. when the system has been challenged in criminal courts has been successfully
defended. There is no mileage in this position but is in fact supe

Dear Jarnail,

T enclose advice from Harry Bowyer. I know it will be unpalatable, but for what it may be worth I
share his view. In the instant case, our response must be dependent on time scales for completion of
the inspection. We are only just beginning to see these issues raised by defence solicitors and the
POL00143377
POL00143377

sooner we grasp the problem the better. If you want any more do call, otherwise I will await the
outcome of your consultations before responding to the defence.

sincerely,

CartwrightKing
