SUMMARY OF WORK:

Fujitsu work required to enable suspension of data purging (Audit and call data) and continue
for 12 months total, as requested in ROM Request CRO3170 and B& P0029. This CT provides
sufficient additional storage to increase the Audit data storage capacity from 7 years to 8 years
and associated configuration changes.

RELATED WORK PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
(the “WORK PACKAGE”)

Fujitsu will perform the following activities

1. Re-plan the work associated with CT 1490 (Audit Storage replacement) to enable suspension
of Audit data purging at earliest practicable date.

2. Liaise with Post Office Ltd to agree and confirm/amend date to suspend data purging.

3. Present early Test results to confirm readiness of new Audit storage.

4. Configure applications and TWS job schedule to cease purging old data.

5. Procure and bring into service additional storage capacity for new Audit data storage.

6. Liaise with Post Office Ltd to confirm the date to resume data purging.

7. Change TWS schedule and configure applications to recommence purging old data.

NB. As previously noted (ROM response 3170), any requirement to extend suspension of data
purging beyond a total of 12 months will require a new and separate Change Request to be
agreed by Fujitsu. Otherwise, at the end of 12 months suspension of purging, and unless Post
Office Ltd have requested it earlier, data purging will be resumed.

RELATED WORK PACKAGE OUTPUTS:

1. Plan produced and updated as required to confirm achievable timelines

2. Test results produced for new Audit data storage (Pen Test, data storage/retrieval tests)
3. Confirmation of suspension of data purging on/from agreed date

4. Reports on progress and/or testing, produced weekly/fortnightly as appropriate

5. Confirmation of commissioning of extra storage capacity

6. Confirmation of recommencement of data purging on/from agreed date.

PAYMENT PLAN/TERMS OF PAYMENT:

The man-days and man-hours (as appropriate) in respect of each activity under this CT will be
charged on an ‘actuals’ Time and Materials basis including where work is required to rectify
failures to meet any Acceptance Criteria as listed in this CT and with the Other Charges will be
invoiced monthly in arrears. Payment by Post Office Ltd is due within 30 days of receipt of
invoice.

This CT was impacted based on an activity estimate to deliver the associated Post Office Ltd
RWP/CR and no contingency provision has been included. It is possible that the actual effort
required to deliver this CT will exceed the estimate and, should this occur, Fujitsu will raise a
separate CT to cover the additional spend unless Post Office Ltd has pre-agreed funding for
likely risk elements.

Fujitsu will use reasonable endeavours to give Post Office Ltd early notification if the estimated
Time and Materials are likely to be exceeded and a further Work Order is required.

For the avoidance of doubt, the amounts estimated in respect of individual activities defined in
“Gross Price’ (above) may be exceeded, providing the total estimate in ‘Gross Price’ is not
exceeded.

Notwithstanding any rates listed in these CTs, charges will be invoiced at the rates applicable in
the Financial Year in which the service is provided.

All sums payable under these Commercial Terms are stated exclusive of VAT.
