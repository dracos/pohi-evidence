Jarnail

At the hearing on the 14th July 2009, the defence indicated that they would be seeking the services of
a forensic accountant to analyse the Horizon data as Ms Misra is now challenging the accuracy of
Horizon. I have tried to order the data for the time Ms Misra was subpostmaster (3 years) but as you
can see from the e-mail from Dave Posnett there are a number of issues.

Please could you advise counsel of these issues and inform me as to what action to take with regard
to this data.

John,

Due to the size of the ARQ request I cannot authorise Fujitsu to proceed at this stage. This equates to
approximately 31 ARQs (1 per month of data). We have an annual allowance of 670 ARGQs, so the
Defence request represents quite a chunk of our quota. Also, we can only request 60 ARQs per
month, so this Defence request could be detrimental to other Prosecution requests,

We have a contract with Fujitsu to acquire ARQs for our prosecution cases, and we pay for these. We
do asist where we can and where requests are reasonable in terms of our quota eg police, other parts
of the business, small Defence requests,etc.

For ‘lumpy’ Defence requests, we can obtain a quote from Fujitsu for the work, which will then sit
outside our quota. Defence can then 1) pay up, 2) seek Legal Aide and pay up, 3) cancel the request,
or 4) seek authority from the court to insist that the request is carried out.

Aside from the costs and our quota, another reason for this approach is because many cases plead
guilty at the eleventh hour and/or nothing is found by ‘experts’ to challenge the Fujitsu data - the usual
attempts of muddying the waters.

Can you consider and seek views/input from our Criminal Lawyer in the case. Happy to discuss if
need be.

Regards,

Dave Posnett

Can you please assist with the following three points.

1. Andy Dunks of fujitsu is required as a witness in this trial and I would be grateful if you could inform
him of the dates.

2. The defence will be calling there own expert to analyse the Horizon data as the defendant is now
claiming that some of the loss in this case is caused by errors within Horizon. Therefore, I will need
transaction log data covering the period 30th June 2005 to 14th January 2008 together with a covering
witness statement.

3. Finally, in his statement Andy Dunks makes mention of the fact that this PO has made 107 calls to
the Horizon System Helpdesk during Mrs Misra's term as subpostmaster. A further too statement is
required from Andy Dunks in which he will exhibit a CD containing the details of the reasons for the
107 calls. Andy is aware of what I require but wants me to make my request through the casework
team.
