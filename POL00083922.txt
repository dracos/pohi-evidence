raised by TIP in respect of all transactions that constitute a cash account have not been received by TIP or when
electronic cash accounts received where transactions that have been conducted and received by TIP are missing
from the respective cash account lines. These issues have come to light when comparing a TIP derived cash account
Iwith the electronic cash account sent by Pathway. Not all instances of similar occurrences have been lagged by TIP
las the physical resource to check each occurrence of a difference within the derived versus the electronic is not
lavailable, It was expected that this facility would by now be comparing like with tike. This is very significant.
Missing transactions and missing cash account line entries cause reconciliation failures within POCL back end
Isysterns and error resolution is invoked. The cash account produced by the Organisational Unit in these instances
must be in doubt and is not a fair reflection of the business undertaken at each Organisational Unit. A
Isubpostmaster may be asked to bring to account an error, but the error was produced via system failure rather than
human failure. Many hours of investigation at both the front end and back end have taken place to help resolve
these problems. The benefits assigned to POCL back end system in respect of an automated cash account are being
questioned.

Severity: FOCL — - high - would effect POCL's ability to produce an accurate cash account.
PWY — - accept the problem exists. Would argue about the severity - would it genuinly effect the accounting

as it currently exists?

lion: Steve Warwick to provide rectification of this issue. PWY understand the problem and are currently
working on the fix. Steve Warwick to provide details.

Analysis of Acceptance Incident (6)

Pathway have analysed all occurrences where the (TIP) derived cash account daes not cquat the actual cash account (up to
'TIP 883). ‘There is no suggestion or indication that there is fault in the calculation or reporting of the Cash Account; the
incidents relate to transaction reporting to TIP. This currently has 4 rate of occurrence of c. 1% of outlets per week (6
occurrences in last 2 wesks), which it is agreed is unsustainably high when considered against a target population of

(i) very occasionally a transaction is recorded at the outlet with a missing attribute (start time or mode). The processing
rules specified for the TPS harvester reject any transaction which has a missing attribute, meaning these transactions are
not forwarded to TIP. They are however, correctly posted in cash account processing.

"The harvester specification is being modified to (j) reconstitute any missing start time attribute by imterpolation from
immediately preceding transactions within the customer session, or (if none is present) to log an event and (ii) map any
null mode attribute to "serve customer" attribute. (No occurrences outside this mode have been detected in any incident.)
Pathway will monitor occurrences of any such null attributes and work will continue to ensure that all transactions are
correctly recorded with all attributes at the autlet. This will eliminate this problem; it is theoretically possible that a very
occasional transaction will result with an invalid item transaction mode, although there has been no instance of this
detected in any of the analysed cases,
(ji) on one occasion a reference data change from core to non core and the new Reference Data mapping of products to
Cash Account cause any transactions conducted within the CAP prior to the RD change not to be posted to the Cash
Account, In this case there is no fault within the Pathway system. Pathway has proposed an approach to POCL to avoid
this problem through the use of product types within RD.

[Note that report TIPSB9 (2/8) is under investigation but relates ta SLA delivery window (AB42)].

IA summary of outstanding incidents and analsed status under AI376 is atrached.

"The fix to reconstitute missing transaction attributes was introduced 2/8. For the current CAP eny reported such
loceurrences will be analysed; there should no missing transactions subsequent to the fix. For ongoing monitoring Pathway
believe a larget maximum occurrence due to this cause for the next CAP should be 2 (0.67%) at which point the incident

‘Analysis of Acceptance Incid
A problem with scanning OBCS bar codes was first notified in November 1998 by HSH follawing an increase in calls

from PMs regarding impounded order books. The books concemed had a new type of printed bar code and so the problem
was initially attributed ta the new method of printing adopted by BA.

Although problems were originally believed to be confined Lo one print run in November and calls relating to problem did
jocase by mid-December, calls re-emerged in late December. Further tests in early January revealed thar the problem could
be caused by a change to the paper.

{in mid-January, PIRA examined the paper supplies and concluded that the relative humidity levels of paper were 7% when
the acceptable industry level is 5.3%, In addition, it was found that the necessary ink-hardening agent was not present in
the paper. Arrangements were made far the immediate replacement of the hardening agent and for new supplies of paper
to be tested.

in early February, a temporary procedure was introduced by POCL thal involved treating the order book as a nan bar-
lcoded book. This procedure is still in place, Tests undertaken by Welch Allyn on behalf of ICL Pathway in mid-February
lconcluded that the problems resulted from the poor print quality of the bar codes.

lin March, BA received new supplies of paper. However, in mid-April, it was confirmed that these provided little
‘improvement in paper quality. Further paper was ordered from another supplier. In late-May it was arvised that more
[positive results had been obtained using this paper.

In early June, BA provided the view that the ESNS scanner used by ALPS had greater tolerance than Horizon scanner, Ih
ate June, BA provided evidence that some bar codes could be read with the ESNS scanner but not with the Horizon
scanner. However, it was confirmed that the Horizon scanner did accord with the agreed specification and those problems
did not occur before November 1998.

resis of bar codes continue to be undertaken by both BA and Pathway. Pathway is currently awaiting confirmation from
IPOCL that the tests carried out earlier this year by BA were compliant to ‘Code 3 of 9” standard bar codes and that their
tests have included the original paper and ink combination. Currently, ICL Pathway is beginning tests on a batch of 90
barcodes received from BA via POCL, The majority is being tested at BRAO1 using both the ESNS and OBCS scanner,
Ibut two have been forwarded to Welch Allyn (via the Implementation team at KID01) for verification/ validation of the
bar codes compliance with the agreed standard.

Clearance Action (7)

At present ICL Pathway does not believe that sufficient evidence has been provided that the bar code scanner is operating
lout of specification and request that this Incident is closed.

CL Pathway and POCL are continuing to investigate DSS's concerns, and ongoing management of these issues will
[continue via our respective Service Managment groups.

Dear John
Re: Review of Acceptance Incident 218 - Training

An analysis of the evaluation against the business impacts identified in the
Acceptance Incident is attached.

Although many of the criteria have been met, it is regarded as significant that the
training and go-live process relies on the deployment of POCL HFSO resource. On
the basis of this evaluation, we are not prepared to reduce the severity rating from
‘high’.

POCLs view is that without this resource there would have to be a complete revision
of the training approach in order to ensure helpdesks were not rendered ineffective
by the high level of calls following the first and, to some extent, subsequent balances.

POCLs view is that HFS5O resource was not deployed as an extension of training.
The cost impact and diversion of resource which this requires must be addressed by
ICL Pathway.

Ttis also POCLs view that the related adequacy of HSH support must be integrated
with this Acceptance Incident and removed as an additional source of concern.

The training improvements identified as part of the qualitative research by Post
Office Business Consultancy must also be addressed as part of a rectification plan.

Yours sincerely

t. The Office Managers ability to

sare also that the
number of cash account related
incidents reported to POCL NBSC is
considerably greater than expected.
(About a third of the calls coming to
NBSC Help Desk indicate a lack of
understanding, of the cash accocnting,
and balancing prory LISH are
responsible far resolving these service
incidents but are unable to cope with
the content and volume of calls which
are therefore: having, la be dealt with
by NBSC. As Lhe Manger’s training
course is deficient, NBSC and
presumably HSH staff who receive
this training course, are also
inadequately trainee.

@ Reduction in demand on suppert - Measured
through a reduction in the number of calls (at
the peak time on Wednesday evening and
Thursday morning) for advice and guidance
lo support stock unit balancing, office
balancing and production of the cash account
received at the HSH and/or at the NBSC,

@ Reduction in the length of calls from the
additional 25 offices,

@ The overall number of calls in weeks 1,2 and 3
by the LT? offices showed a reduction on the
LT1 mirror offices for the equivalent three
weeks.

‘The average number of calls made by offices
during the non-peak days also showed a
reduction.

However, it should be noted there is a significant
increase in the 24 week cash account for bath
LT1 and LT?2 offices when there is no support al
these outlets, suggesting that some of the outlet
managers still de nat have the canfidence or
ability to complete the process unsupported.

@ The evidence to analyse this criteria is limited
and was regarded as indicative only. The broad
conclusion is that the evidence is insufficient to
make a substantive judgement regarding first
cash accounts but there is overall evidence to
suggest a reduction in call times for 2°¢ cash
accounts. However, it again has to be noted that
the length of calls for both LT1 and LT2 offices
was significantly higher on 2°4 cash accounts
than the 1* cash account suggesting the critical
requirement for training to be
supported/ delivered by HSH. It also
underlines the necessity of.the HFSO support to
balancing in week 1.

11 August 1999

Dear Bruce
Thank you for you letter of 10 August.

Parhway is convinced that it has done everything that ir can to
improve the training and prepare users for Horizon, and that the
essence of che remaining issues that you are seeking to address
relate to POCL’s own management of change. This was made
clear to Bruce McNiven in correspondence from John Bennett
(KP/99jul339 dated 7 July *99) and a second letter to Bruce
MeNiven (dated 25" June ‘99),

Pathway has consistently maintained that user confidence in the
system will be achieved only through managing the change in
POCL business processes such that POCL’s target standard
approach is adopted across the Post Office network. Until this
achieved by POCL, ir will be necessary for POCL to substitnte
additional support in one form or another. Increased use of che
revised training, which is now a very suitable vehicle, is one such
form. Another is the gradual dissemination of the target business
process through POCL’s own support, however provided, to the
balancing business process.

For these reasons, Pathway believes the Acceptance Incident 218,
which formally relates to training, should now be closed.

Pathway does not accepr thar any further revisions to the training
courses, other than routine minor improvements already
identified, are required, or indeed are now desirable in light of the
commitments made by bath parties to reviscd courses and
collateral,
Parkway bas nade every effort ( make changes to che craining to
POCIs satisfaction throughout jive mai, such thac every course
hus been significantly changed. Furthermore, an additional 2+
outlets were installed in July, ar POCL’s request, to form a basts on
which the effeetiveness of che training improvements could be -

id indeed have been - demonstrated. Ar every stage POCL has

ad vomplete approval authority for the changes being made and
has registered its satisfaction with che results of these changes.

‘The narrative below details the extensive steps taken by Parhwat
with POCL approval, to address the concerns expressed in AI 218.

Counter M er & Cou i courses revised

In response to feedback received from POCL and formally through
CR RO052b, ICL Parhway has made a large number of detailed
changes to both the Counter Manager and Counter Assistant
training courses. Crucially, the Counter Manager (CM) course
was much modified ro improve coverage and an emphasis placed
an the balancing business process and related issues. The CM
course now devotes much of Day 2 (Workbook 10) to this process
and considerable time is spent explaming the process and checking
the understanding of the delegates.

Both the CM and CA courses have been observed and positively
received by POCL and approved to go forward to National
Rollout including routine minor improvements (Trevor Rollason’s
Email to Andy Barkham of 10/8/99) which Pathway are only too
pleased to incorporate.

ICL Pathway believes that the improved CM taining better
prepares Ourler managers for the task of balancing when they
recurn to the outlet. This improved training, coupled with
changes to the way thar Horizon now handles the balancing
process, makes achieving a balance much easier than during Live

Trial and the comparative success of the extra 24 outlets bears this
out

HESO course revised

POCL requested several changes to the HFSO training programme
in their CR ROO6O. This CR requested changes to the content of
the course, the introduction of a new 4-day MiMAN course and a
new I-day MiECCO course, These new courses provide more
opportunities to practice the migration processes and to work with

different error detection/correction scenarios ~ all of which add
value ta the migration process.

Addirionally, (CL Pathway retrained HFSOs during Live Trial to
provide more training on balancing and related topics.

HESO role positioning

The HFSO role has always been pivoral.co che success of the
programme. In addition to performing migration (a vital function
which sets the scene for the firsr balance) the HFSO also provides
help and support to the Outlet Manager at what can be a stressful
and trying time. At the point of installation the Outler Manager
comes face to face with the Horizon system for the first time since
training and will, naturally, be anxious, even apprehensive. It is
important that the HFSO helps the Ourclec Manager to complete
the migration process effectively and in accordance with the
defined processes,

Extra trainers for balancing support

On a weekly basis since Live Trial, ICL Pathway has been
providing additional balancing support through the use of [CL. TS
trainers. ICL Pathway has borne this cost in recognition of che
need to enhance support Jevels at the HSH and NBSC.

Extra Transition Executives (TEs)

The Transition Executive role exists primarily to provide expert
help and support to the HFSOs. Since Live Trial, an extra TE has
been added to each IP region bringing the coral of TEs to eight -
thus doubling the initial size of this team.

HSH & NBSC trainin,

ICL Pathway has trained HSH and NBSC staff in the revised
processes and systems embodied in LT2. This training was

targeted at those ropics most frequently calling for helpdesk
assistance,

CRs/Balancing process changes

A number of changes to the Horizon system and the way that it
deals with balancing were implemented in LT2. These changes
sought to make balancing easier and to remove unnecessary steps
from balancing processes and procedures,

Description of Incident (10)
Evidence from the Live Trial shows thar the counter system is subject to "lockups" and "sereen freezes", where the

system halts in mid-processing giving the user no opportunity to take any corrective action. This is either exhibited
oy the system hanging or presenting a blank blue screen, The user is forced to ring the HSH and is advised to
reboot the system. The immediate effect of this problem is in terms of the reliability of the Service Infrastructure's
input devices. However, once the underlying reasons for the problem are identified, this could change the
Jperception.At least 25 such occurrences have been identified on the LTSC log between the start of the Core
Observation Period on 31st May and the 28th June. However, as such problems should be reported directly to the
HSH, it is likely that this number represents only a small proportion of the total in which case, this problem would
lhe widespread. Consequently, POCL's initial assessment is that this incident is likely to be more than low severity.

System faults reported to the Horizon System Helpdesk on Wednesday/Thursdays for the past 12 weeks have been
analysed. ‘The reason for only reporting on Wed/Thurs figures is thac these have been monitored over an extended period
lof time, and da represent the "worst case" figures, Figures for each day are now monitored (as from the énd of Iuly).

The HSH calls analysed arc provided an the Worksheet "HSH Call Analysis".

These figures continue ta be monitored but clearly show that the number of “lockouts" and frozen screens has fallen ta the
lowest figure for the past 12 weeks since the introduction of LT2.

This will continue to be monitored, but should be reduced to Low severity on the basis of the progress shown,

Clearance Action (7)

Pathway will continue to investigate the root cause of residual occurrences and a further formal review undertaken on
lcampletion of the fist three months of roll-out.

On the basis of further information provided by POCL (the telephone survey) on 6 August and Pathway's selective re-
survey conducted 9-10 August, Pathway has carried out further analysis and testing and has identified no fault conditions

jas at the 11/8/99. See separate document.

On the basis of the significant progress to date Pathway expects this Al to be recategorised by both POCL and Pathway as
Low, by Wednesday 11/8.

Rebools without calling the HSHD
{lis undorbtedly the case that cuviets are rebooting their counters witheu! culling the
HSH.

Using the POCL telephone survey data supplied by POCL on 6 3 its was possible to re-
survey more closely the outlets not calling the HSHD before rebooting and by inspection
of the associated message stores seek to understand the reasons why outlet staff are
habitually rebooting.

Pathway will also in the immediate firure and on a random basis contact outlets that arc
rebooting so that 2 real fault unknown to us at present is not overlooked.

The question posed by POCL was not sufficiently specific 10 discriminate between
several classes of problem. Pathway CS has asked POCL to make the questions used on
the survey more specific and would ask that the comment reason field is completed if at
all possible.

Why are outlets rebooting?

In general, rebooting is seen — incorrectly - as a “cure for all ills" and understandably
outlet staff will not always be ready to expend time reporting to the HSHD a course of
action they have already embarked upon.

The reboots that are recorded and that are not associated with a call to the HSHD do
inelude cases where the system unit is being turned on after having been turned off
avernight or in error during the day. Although instructions are clear not to tum off
syslem units, it is clearly the case that staff do tum them off, as was evidenced by the
difficulties Pathway had in upgrading caunters to LT2.

Where a user has made a mistake, he may choose to reboot instead of Undo-ing an
uncommitted transaction or Reversing a committed one. In the latter case a reversal
would/will sull be required, but it is possible that this may not be understood. It is not
possible for Pathway to distinguish this case from the message store record.

A user may get into a thought “loop" whereby he cannot see how to return to a desired
state and reboots lo wipe the slate clean and have another try. There are several instances
of the user having been coached through such a thought loop by the HSHD. Again, itis
not possible for Pathway to distinguish this case from the message store record.

In some offices we belicve the keyhoard is being used as an auxiliary work surface with
books and manuals being placed on it. It is possible that if a key or key is permanently
pressed the counter will exhibit symptoms of being frozen, although it should be possible

to unfreeze it after a short delay. Similarly it is not possible for Pathway to distinguish
this case from the messaye store record,

Pauw ay’s search for faults

Puhway, nevertheless accepts there are probubly significant residual faults in the system

that could present themselves as a “freeze” and is working hard to find them. At ihe time
of preparing this report none has been found. Consideration is being given to increasing

the swap file size, although testing has eliminated this as a specific cause.
