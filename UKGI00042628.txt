Business overview

Post Office is a unique provider of mails, financial and government services across a nationwide network. It has a national
network larger than that of all the UK banks put together, with 93% of the total UK population (and 99% of those living in towns
and cities) living within one mile of a post office.

Post Offices provide a range of services to customers across the socio-economic spectrum, carry out a critical economic function
for many small firms, and often play a significant social role in communities. Over 170 different services are available over Post
Office counters and all but one is subject to at least a degree of compet

ne.evanr}funding from Government for 2011-2015 announced in October 2010, the Govemment requires Post
Office Ltd to ensiire that there is a minimum of 11,500 post offices across the country, and that this network conforms to the strict
access criteria (established in 2007 following a national consultation) which ensure reasonable access to Post Office services
regardless of where people live.

This network requirement hampers the business's ability to operate on a commercial basis and largely explains the areas in the
traffic lights review where the business's performance is sub-optimal: amber for strategy and financial performance; red for
balance sheet risk (also impacted by POL's share of RM's current pension deficit).

Dependence on access to post office services is particularly acute in rural areas where the post office branch is in many cases
the only local retail outlet, but branches are also of real importance in deprived urban communities.

Post Office Ltd is facing increasing competition, especially in the bill payments market, by competitors such as PayPoint. Post
Office Ltd also has to compete openly for Government work.

Business overview: market breakdown

Market breakdown
Mails Services

+ POLis facing the challenge of declining mail volumes, and separation from Royal Mail. It will be imperative for POL and RM to
successfully negotiate a suitable length IBA before separation. Negotiations are at an advanced stage.

+ POL's product mix in the market will change. As the volume of letters declines they will seek to grow the volume of packages they
distribute.

+ To improve the customer experience, POL aims to reduce queue times, extend opening hours, and improve the in-branch
experience of customers, focussing on developing ‘Post&Go’ self service kiosks, solutions for small businesses, online mail
support and pre-paid mails.

Government Services

+ POL plans to become the physical channel altemative to Government's own direct channels for those customers who cannot
interact online and for those services which require @ physical touch point, e.g. ID services.

+ POL faces increasing competition from others in this market, and must openly compete to win Government services.
Financial Services

+ POL ims to deliver a proposition which reflects customer needs and preferred channel choices. For example, they are currently
considering a pre-paid debit card and working with DWP on a transactional account providing working credit.

+ This is a highly competitive market in which POL has had some success due to public perception of it as a trusted brand, POL
have been particularly successful in foreign exchange services where it is the market leader.

Operating performance: restructuring & organisational changes

Work is underway to move POL from its current position as a subsidiary of RMG to become a sister company
of RMG under a common parent company, Royal Mail Holdings ple (RMH).

This is proposed to coincide with the implementation of the pension solution on 1 April 2012, subject to state
aid clearance.

At that point, the new Inter-Business Agreement will have been agreed, POL staff will become formal POL
employees and new group governance arrangements will be put in place.

We are developing proposals with the companies for the role and constitution of the RMH Board once RMG
and POL have moved to sister companies under the RMH holding company at March 2012.

We envisage that the businesses will remain in the same corporate and tax group, but operationally separate,
until the earlier of an RMG transaction or a POL mutualisation.

Anew Chair and senior non-executive director have recently been appointed in order to bolster POL’s
negotiations in separation discussions. The Board will be further strengthened by appointment of new NEDs.

The company is also deploying a People Engagement plan aimed to ensure that the whole organisation
(including agents) is aligned behind the strategic plan.

Operating performance: opportunities

+ The major opportunity is network modernisation, converting over half of all post offices into new ‘local’ and
‘main’ models with fully variable pay based on the volume of transactions. POL intend to offer a ~ 40%
increase in opening hours and reduce queue times so that 90% customers are served within 5 minutes.

+ Beyond this, Post Office Ltd will develop a much greater focus on innovation, setting aside funds to develop
new propositions. In particular they will investigate:

— Development of proposition to support universal credit.

= Online mails services aimed at supporting growth in mails.

= Payments solutions which will support the phasing out of cheques (such as pre-paid debit cards).
— Further self-service solutions.

— Development of relationship with Credit Unions to increase financial inclusion.

— Commencement of RBS contract, and possible progress with HSBC and Santander.

+ Of these, the major one is developing its universal credit proposition, which could be aligned with a
transactional account offering potential significant revenue growth.

Illustrative Valuation

Key assumptions

We expect that, upon separation, Post Office shares will be held at zero value in BIS accounts.

Valuation of the Post Office is not something the team undertakes for deliberate reasons; this is an illustrative valuation
constructed for this Investment Review purpose only. It is highly confidential and not for onward circulation.

We have set out some illustrative outputs based on DCF valuation only. (There are no suitable comparable companies or
transactions from which we could produce alternative valuation methodologies.)

Central case: 8% WACC, 1% terminal growth rate, based on the current business plan.

Very indicative figures below.

Board and management

* Quality of management team and board and shareholder relationship are Green in traffic lights.

Significant changes to the top team in recent years. Three MDs during the past two years.

Current MD is Paula Vennells (formerly Network Director since 2007).

Anew Financial Director, Chris Day (former Group Financial Controller, BBC) and new Financial Services Director,
Nick Kennett (former MD, epay) have recently started.

Separation from Royal Mail requires an independent voice for POL within the Royal Mail group governance structure
— ANew Chair of POL, Alice Perkins, has been appointed with a strong public sector background. She is undertaking a board review.

— Anew Non-Executive Director, Nell McCausland, has been appointed with a strong retail background that will complement the chair’s
Public sector background.

— We are in the process of recruiting a further NED to POL.
— These appointees do not sit on the Royal Mail board and are independent of Royal Mail in any discussions about separation.

Corporate governance
— Chairman's proposals would assist in making POL combined code compliant on separation,

Remuneration and incentives

— POL MD remuneration set through RM Board remuneration process. HMG also has an approval right over POL executive incentive
arrangements to deliver the strategy agreed in October 2010. When the business separates, new articles of association will give HMG
fuller rights to approve POL Board remuneration directly. Upon separation from Royal Mall, ShEx will join the POL board.

— Bonus worthy metrics are split between financial performance (focus product sales, all product contribution, operating profit, total

operational costs, free cashflow), customer (call centre performance, mystery shopper) and people (staff engagement index, serious
accidents).
