Looking through the previous correspondence on this, the implication was that this would be post R1 and as a change
only tested on LST.
We're now talking about R2 and therefore need to re-impact on the assumption that it will be tested by SV&l.

However, talking with John today it appears that R2 might slip 3 months — would this CP be delayed as well?

George,
I am not sure why you think this should be re-impacted. It was previously impacted and approved for implementation
post release 1. Release 2 would provide the first practical opportunity for this.

David,
At the last R2 checkpoint you asked that this CP be considered for R2.
As such shouldn't it be sent round for re-impacting.

FOR IMPACT (Release: HNG-X)

URGENT — HNG-X CP0336 (pvcs Ref cp4s67) - Enable analysis of

The above CP is enclosed for your urgent impact assessment
Please return your impact response by: Tuesday, 17" March 2009

Your impact information is required to enable a business case to be presented to the Change Boards and to allow
informed decisions to be made.

The Dimensions database is not yet ready to host the Change Proposals for HNG-X. They are being held on
PVCS for visibility and will be ported across (and withdrawn from PVCS) when Dimensions is available.

Addressees are requested to impact this CP as follows:

On the Change & Document Web Service HNG-X Change & Document Management on the left-hand side of the screen there is
an entry for RMGA, please select this and then select HNG-X CP Impact

This entry can be used by anyone via the hyperlink above and following the instructions:
In principle:

. You do not have to be logged onto the Web to use it, however, it is easier if you are as the form will pre-populate with your
name, e-mail address and telephone number.

. Users fill out the form using a mixture of free format text, drop down lists with some hints/tips as to what information is
required.

+ Having completed the form, choose the SEND button, this will then confirm the information has been sent and email this to
the POA Change Management mailbox.

* This information is then stored (at the same time as being sent) into a csv file. Every time a user submits an impact it is
added to the csv file, it does not get over-written.

* Change Management will use this information for Board presentation and for porting into Dimensions when that system is
available.

Similar to CP Impacting for Horizon, please ensure that the following information is provided within your impact:
1. MAN DAY EFFORT by Unit (Split incremental and non-incremental, by Grade Rate, activity and quantity)
2. DOCUMENTS AFFECTED (Reference and version number)
3. NON-LABOUR COSTS (Incremental and non-incremental)
Additional to Horizon there are tick boxes to indicate that:
4. HARDWARE IS REQUIRED (details to be provided in the Comments section)
5. SOFTWARE LICENISNG IS REQUIRED (details to be provided in the Comments section)

If this change does not affect you in any way, please return a comment of 'NO IMPACT'.

CC’s are provided with this CP for visibility and information at this stage.
