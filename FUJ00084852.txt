en they completed the balance on 6th Feb and cleared the loss from Local Suspense, the amount cleared was £9839.45 instead of
the loss they had put into local suspense, which was £39.57.

[his appears to be a consequence of something that happened during the previous TP rollover on 2nd Jan: a ‘gain to lc
lsuspense' of £9799.88 was included in the DEF opening figures.

I don't think any of the local suspense products should ever appear in opening figures, however I have found 14 such lines (all
prod 6295 Gain to LS, all different branches). Unfortunately all created Nov-Dec last year, so there is almost no remaining
counter evidence.

Further investigations:

s* Exactly how did these records cause the observed effect?

he old data is picked up, along with the correct data, during the Branch Trading Statement production (at the end of the period
BEFORE the problem is visible at the branch). The old opening figure (which may be for one or more of the Local Suspense products
6295-6298, associated with an unknown stock unit) gets converted during branch rollover, to prod 6295 Gain to Local Suspense
(though the sign may be positive or negative), and written as an opening figure for the subsequent period, stock unit DEF.

lat the end of the second period, this is included when the amount to be cleared from Local Suspense is calculated (when the last
stock unit is rolled over), so the branch is forced to clear it.

** How to identify the problem from branch reports:
[Branch Trading Statement: the sum of the two Discrepancy Transferred lines does not match the total of the two Discrepancy
resolved Lines

suspense Account report: the B/Fwd figure on the report does not match the C/Fwd figure on the report for the previous TP.

* Why were the records not removed by the normal archiving process? The records, created Autumn 2010, belonged to stock units
that have since been deleted. Normally they would have been removed before the ‘deleted stock unit' entry itself was removed from
the list of stock units, but there were some teething problems with archiving and they were ‘orphaned' and are now ignored by the
larchiving process.

k* How do we remove the records to prevent future problems? Once well away from the problem TP, eg once into TP 1, get the

FUJ00084852
FUJ00084852

ranches to recreate a stock unit with the same name a5 the problem one, then delete it again. Of we just delete them from the
Jdatabase under MSC.

t+ Were there any affected branches which have since closed? T have checked branches closed within the last 90 days, all ok. For
ranches closed longer ago which might be under investigation, the suspense account reports and BTS could be checked (see above).

t+ There are 19 other branches which have old data in the affected table, but not relating to Local Suspense ? could this cause
jany problems with the branch accounts?
Ir have checked very carefully and conclude that these extra lines have no ongoing impact on the branch accounts.

‘* There is old data in some other tables that use the same archiving strategy - this doesn't affect the branch balancing in the
same way, but what would happen if a stock unit with the same name was recreated?

I** Any corrective actions?
Itocal suspense should always be zero when the branch is rolled over - should this be checked and reported?
I think the archiving strategy is now ok, but this may need to be reviewed.

can we add an extra check into the branch balancing process so errors like this would be reported in future (similar to the event
hich is raised if the BTS Trading position is not zero)?

6:34 User:Anne Chambers

Possible checks are
la) do the next TP's Opening Figures, generated for stock unit DEF, include any Local Suspense products? (raise event if they
don't net to zero value)

lb) does the sum of the two Discrepancy Transferred lines on the BTS, for the Branch Total, equal the sum of the two Discrepancy
Resolved lines? (raise event if not).

ror the problem under investigation here, the first check would have identified a problem when branch 11458 rolled into TP 10,
land the second check at the end of TP 10.

lAnalysis and Root cause:

lcenerally all Local suspense movement transactions are written during stock unit TP rollover (6295/6296) ,during last stock unit
rollover, and also from the Housekeeping menu (6297/6298) .

n office rollover, local suspense from branch opening figures and movements for all stock units are netted off, and should
result in 0 value carried forward.

hen Office rollover ,the previous suspense opening figures and suspense movements for current trading period are summed, netted
off, and written as new suspense opening figures to SU DEF.

in the present scenario, the previous local suspense movements for a deleted stockunit are retained in BRANCH_BTS DATA. (i.e
9799.88) .This Local suspense record was not cleared while next office rollover since SU was deleted.

lafter 205 days the stock unit was created with same name So sytem summed off old non-zero local suspense movements amount from
BRANCH BTS DATA along with Ls movements from present trading period. (i.e £9799.88 + £39.57 = £9839.45).

keproducing Steps:

h. Create a stock unit 'SU1'and attach to present user.
2. Carry out a local supense transaction by declaring cash £100 for SU1.
8, Rollover all stockunits to next TP.

4. Attach user to another stock unit and delete stockunit SU1.

FUJ00084852
FUJ00084852

Change system date to after 205 days.
Carry out a local supense transaction by declaring stock £23 for present. SU.

- Create a stock unit with same name which is deleted ‘SU1'.

- Rollover office to next Tp.

ho. Suspense Roport and Office Trading statement shows total clearted amount for current TP

tested with Anne Chambers using COUNTER APP 74 2 (LST R9.01.00.40
the behaviour of the Counter app now, on encountering such historic data, is that:

H. No messages warning of the problem are displayed when rolling an affected Counter, including rolling the last Counter
2. Following the Counter rolls, the Local Suspense includes the historic data

3. When rolling the Branch, message MSG31332 is displayed to alert the PM that "Dis
atch" and that the PM needs to report this

4. The Branch roll can complete, including the erroneous data

Once the PM reports the problem to the Help Desk, the call should be transferred to Fujitsu to resolve. The point at which the
problem is noted is at the time it arises, rather than a year later.

closing PEAK with Anne's agreement.

the original problem was fully investigated and resolved several months ago. We have now added a couple of new checks to the
balancing process, to alert us if anything similar happens again. KEL raised to document what to do if the events are seen.
