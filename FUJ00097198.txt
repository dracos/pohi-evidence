Branch Router roll-out — deployed 11,394 (99.4% of estate, remainder are “tail management” non-penalties)

I

™ 26/03/10 - High Volume Pilot suspended due to system instability issues — root cause traced to Oracle
Branch Database bugs and tuning issues not identified in testing

@ 31/03/10 - Red Alert initiated, High Volume pilot resumed 08/06/10, downgraded to Amber Alert 21/06/10

= No major incidents in live for 7 weeks

™ 29/06/10 - High Volume pilot completed, Post office approved to commence Rollout.

@ 30/06/10 - Rollout started, with 96% success rate*

= *Note: Post Office continuing to cancel 5-10% of scheduled migrations for their operational reasons (branches in early
rollout had insufficient notice). If this continues, will increase tail — estimated to complete in September.

@ 6/07/10 —- HNGX deployed to estate = 2,241 Branches (19.5%) and 7,969 counters (26.3%)

= Completion of HNGX rollout now end August = 12 week slippage vs Q4 and Q1 Budget assumption

& Significance of slippage: Post Office will claim £1.2m per month for the last delay. FJ will offset this by
claiming Post Office cannot meet planned beat rate

™ Actions to minimise delays and/or budget overruns:

= Propose increase in migration daily beat rate in second half of rollout to bring forward completion

@ Provision has been made at the Account level for a Post Office claim of up to £2m. The Programme R1
latest forecast indicates an overrun of £200k on a baseline cost that was approved 12 months ago

Summary:

™@ There is now a high level of confidence that the technical beat rate can be met and that the solution can cope
with high branch volumes

™ There is less confidence in Post Office’s ability to schedule and support the planned beat rate

@ Account is trying to contain impact of cost overrun from HVP delay — negotiations underway at Account level.

m@ HNGX Programme — Q2 Budget unchanged from MTP

™@ Issues above will deteriorate forecast by circa £0.2m (from
forecast which has held steady at £92.3m for 12 months)

@ Account level:

= 09/10 result showed overall improvement on Q4 Budget (£4.8m) due to
significant New Business being closed which more than offset £2m
provision to cover risk of POL compensation claim based on September
2009 CCN (i.e. £1m per month delay)

m 10/11 forecast shows overall improvement of £8.2m against MTP due to
significant cost saving opportunities identified

= However, additional Programme delays noted above create significant
risk to this forecast as follows:

¢ An additional £1m to cover the risk of further POL compensation claims based
on rollout completion date of end August 2010

* Delays to implementation of cost saving initiatives
