Dear Jerneil,

Regina - v - Susan Jane Rudkin — Stafford Crown Court -

Confiscation Proceedinge - 2lst August 2009. :
»

Thank you for your fax and letter of the Sth August enclosing copies of Rich-
ard Nelson's. letter of the 24th July and Henrietta Paget's e-mail of the
3rd August.

\
It 4s quite correct, that I advised Defance Counsel Peter Hampton at the sent— i
.encing hearing on the let May last that Royal Mail would be seeking a total -- :
of £44,689-82 from Mrs. Rudkin, This was in accordance with Ged Harbinson's i
e-mail dated: 25th February 2009 (copy enclosed). I was informed that Mr. I
Rudkin had’ been appointed as the Subpostmaster at the Ibstock Post Office {
in his Wife's place and that arrangements were in hand, apparently set up :
and approved by ‘Business’, to deduce £1,000-00 per month at source from’Mr. °

Rudkin's salary and to apey this towards xepayment of the monies stolen by

Mrs, Rudkin, . I do not know when this arrangement began but, if it took effect

from the end of lest May, then £3,000=00 will now have been applied towards.

the total sum misappropriated of £43, 894-15,

T trist that this clarifies the position, -

Please note that 1 am on leave next week but, as advised in my letter of
the. Ist June, I confirm that my colleague Steve Corns will be attending.
Henrietta Paget at the above hearing.

Nowra sinceraly. nn
JOHN H, DOVE. , ‘ i

Encl,
