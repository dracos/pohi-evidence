Dear Sirs,

Case Statement)

Ry
Court and Next Hearing: (EEE Crown Court - 17% October 2012

Disclosure of Prosecution Material under Section 7 Criminal Procedure and Investigations
Act 1996

I have considered your defence statement dated 9 August 2012 provided under section 5
Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act (CPIA). Under section 7 CPIA Iam required to
disclose to you any prosecution material which has not been previously disclosed and
which might reasonably be expected to assist your defence, as described in your

statement.

On the basis of the defence statement that you provided, I have not identified any further
prosecution material which is disclosable to you in accordance with the CPIA.

Specifically in relation to the points raised in your statement:-

1. There were no other suspects in this case, and no material relating to the same.
2. None known

3. Your client is charged with false accounting by failing to make entries onto the
Horizon system regarding the deposit slips found, and thus the offence has
occurred outside of the system. Material relating to the Horizon system is therefore
not deemed disclosable at this time.

If you consider that there is other prosecution material which might assist your defence
and which has not already been disclosed, please let me know and I will reconsider my

decision in the light of any further information that you provide. Alternatively, you may
apply to the court under section 8 CPIA. The court will assess your application in the light

of your defence statement,

If you have any query in connection with this letter, please contact me.

Yours sincerely

GRO

Andrew Bole
