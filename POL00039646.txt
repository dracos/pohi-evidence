Business Reason for Change Request:

(A brief description of the business reason for raising this change) The training provided for outlet managers in
Live Trial did not adequately equip managers and subpostmasters to produce an Office Cash Account .POCL
must have a course which does allow managers and subpostmasters to produce a cash account for NRO.In
addition the removal of BES and TT has created a 2.5 hour window of training which POCL would like filled as
described in the Description of change section of this CR.

Description of Change:
(A brief description of the change - business and/or technical) To provide:

1. On the 1.5 day Outlet Managers course a course which equips Managers on return to their office to serve
customer and produce an Office Cash Account using Horizon:
2. On the counter assistant course for (a) assistants who perform Stock Unit Balancing training in this
Sinctionality and (b) for those who do not perform SUB more time spent on drill and practice.
