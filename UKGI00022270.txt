Rodric forwarded a good summary table yesterday which should help. I think Tom C forwarded it. Let's chat
tomorrow when I am in the office.

Kind regards

Kelly has asked for briefing on the Horizon trial, by 11 March and it seems likely the SoS will take an interest in this too.

I spoke to Tom C about what we should provide and we think this needs to go beyond what Steve had prepared prior to
Tom meeting Kelly.
In particular, it would be useful to spell out the key issues emerging from the experts report. I think you’ve read this so
would be able able to provide us with some lines? From what I understand this might include:

e There were bugs in the system

e But no proven link between bugs and losses

e Relates to historical system - No implication that current system is faulty

e Fujitsu have changed their story over time about their ability to change data in the system

As you know, the SoS has also raised the question of whether we should approach the judge to get access to the judgment
ahead of time, and we should probably cover this too.

Happy o discuss
Tom
