2 BT. All Automated offices
BT bar-coded bills

The number of errors caused by offices
incorrectly recording the total amount paid by
customers towards their bill is increasing.

The two most common types of errors are:

The miskeying of the total value of the bill paid

This can be avoided by checking the value
displayed on the screen and/ or by checking the
value printed on the receipt before you hand it to
the customer.

Always ask customers to check the value on their
receipts before they leave the counter position.

Value of redeemed stamps not recorded

The value of BT Savings Stamps redeemed as part
payment of the BT bill (in addition to any

cash/ cheque payment) is frequently not being
recorded as part of the total value of bill payment.

When stamps are offered as payment or part
payment towards a BT bill, they must be
recorded as cash,

Keyboard covers on ALPS equipment

Due to the high level of keyboard failures in ALPS offices, and resultant engineer charges, keyboard
covers are being fitted by the engineers when the ALPS equipment is electrically tested.

We have received reports that some offices have removed the covers after the engineers have left.

These covers have been fitted, at a cost to the business, to prevent keyboard failures as a result of fluid
spillage, or paperclips and coins lodged between the keys.

The covers must not be removed once fitted.

If you remove a cover and the keyboard fails for one of the above reasons, this will be viewed as wilful
damage to post office property, and the costs will be charged back to your office.
