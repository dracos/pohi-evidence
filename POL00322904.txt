DRAFT RELEASE TO CPS

“You may be aware that there has been recent publicity regarding the
Horizon computer system used by Post Office Ltd for accounting purposes.
This system was referred to during a BBC Panorama programme. There has
also been televised coverage of a number of parliamentary discussions. It is
also in the public domain that a number of convicted defendants have asked
the CCRC to look into their cases. In these circumstances we would ask that
any Post Office related cases are referred to Amy Quirk in order that she may
review them and determine whether Post Office may have any relevant
information which may assist the CPS.”
