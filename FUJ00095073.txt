Commentary:

There are now 622 HNG-X branches trading on HNG-X, including 8 Model Offices. The High
Volume pilot was suspended on 26/03/10 due to issues with live service which have impacted
on the HNG-X branches:-

™ Branch database hanging incidents occurred 26/03/10, 27/03/10, 29/03/10 — affecting
HNG-X estate.

® Datacentre power supply issue overnight on 30/03/10.

™ On 01/04/10, there was a problem with the processing of banking and debit card
transactions on Horizon, and a limited impact on some HNG-X branches.

As a result of these issues, the HNG-X Service has been put on Red Alert.

Intensive monitoring of HNG-X has continued since last weekend, and an Oracle Patch Set is
being tested that is known to address the Oracle error messages seen in live when the
Branch database hangs. Subject to completion of testing, this will be implemented into live,
together with a number of other fixes on 04/04/10.

The start of the full HNG-X rollout will be delayed from 12/04/10.

9,958 branches (87%) of the Post Office branches have now had a Branch Router installed.

Next Actions:

Complete Testing of Oracle Patch Set, to implement by Sunday 04/04/10 latest.

Continue to monitor live service with all technical teams to pick up any component failures as
quickly as possible.

Telecons planned with Customer over the weekend to monitor progress.

Action/Support Required:

Support currently provided through an Amber Alert Reference: 1053

Description——--

The Development

for incident

(POL owner KT)

We may not be
compliant from a
Security
perspective before

(POL owner
Glan Trundell)

Caused by-

Cause: Compressed testing
timescales, incident
clearance / software stability
not achieved

Cause: Processes not in
place to support $2700
compliance

I-----Containment Strategy-~

Containment: Micro Manage delivery teams

Model expected workload to forecast effort required

Weekly Reporting to POL

‘Ongoing Manage Incident backlog into available release slots

31/7 - Additional release 14.16 introduced. Additional triage measures
introduced to limit the number of fixes to be incorporated pre live.
Maintenance release introduced to include highly desirable fixes required prior to
rollout.

15/9 Prob% increased. Although, application specific must have peaks fixes
have reduced to a manageable level assisted by replan.

30/9 - Current Peak load manageable, albeit higher than desired

29/10 - Post Weekend B/C PEAKs to support Model Office high. Manageable
but stretching teams - contingency used to extend a number of key staff
24/11 - Peaks remain high (see above)

42/1/10 - Resolving peaks as they arise and keeping on top of them. Do not
anticipate any impact to small volume pilot

8/2/10 - Closed. New issue raised.

Containment: Detailed plan produced;

Weekly review of progress against plan,

Close engagement with Security ops team,

Close engagement with delivery projects to ensure compliance to policy

Next Steps = Ongoing

09/03 Internal 1527001 audit completed and recommendations incorporated into
the remedial action plan, Plan progressing to plan,

Additional Pen Test, plans and respond to audit

23/06 - IS027001 audit observations & rectifications progressing well. Risk
Management deficiencies escalated to account level and corrective action
anticipated early July

31/7 - Corrective action plan for Risk Management deficiencies in place and are
being agreed with POL.

30/9 - 18027001 observations should be closed by 9 Oct 09. Evidence of risk
management process to be in place by mid Oct 09

29/10 - 1S27001 Risk Management process and supporting toolset approved by
POL. Target 18/12 to demonstrate that process is fully operational and
managed

24/11 no change

12/01 - 1027001 compliance due end of Jan 10.

8/2/2010 - Closed. Latest date for achieving 18027001 compliance
estimated as end of Feb 2010. New Risk opened.

fails in Pilot
leading to
Pilot/Rollout stop
(POL owner WR)

Cause: significant defects
are found during pilot,

I Containment Strategy-

Containment: Extensive performance modelling and testing prior to delivery to
test

Next Step = Monitor through testing
JW comment - We are now in testing - so should either kill this off, or re-word
around risk that we are not going to exit with required performance

7/7 Performance tests have been positive Incidents raised dealt with to date
However extended tests into the VOL cycle means this risk will persist until after
migration and VOL execution

31/7 - Horizon performance tested positive, residual risk around HNG-x
performance to be validated during Vol Testing

30/9 - No Change to Risk

29/10 - No change

24/11 Replan of Pilot has resulted in cycle 2 VOL testing completing at the end
of large volume pilot. Therefore an early decision will be needed during cycle 2
to give approval for start of large VOL pilot.

12/01 — No change

8/2/2010 - Volume test started 1/2/2010. Cycle 1 estimated completion is 17/2
1/3/10 - Proven that system can handle a high level of CAPO transactions
(design limit reached for 1 Hour with no problem) Scope of cycle one has been
completed. Some issues found in Pilot need to resolved before rollout
Containment:

Completion of test cycles,

Continuous review of technical approach

War room during pilot

09/03 - SV&l test reports showing positive results

23/06 - Risk may reduced following RV Mig cycle 3 (completes 23/09)

01/07 JW - Comment above is less relevant than positive results out of other
testing strands, notably V+I and SV+1 and acceptance through the RABs. The
containment is about ensuring residual risks at go live are understood, with
mmitigations/ work-around in place at that stage

29 - Pilot is reduced by 3 calendar weeks to accommodate replan and not
impact rollout end date. This reduces time fix must have defects prior to counter
rollout.

30/9 - CP to change migration schedule being impacted and to be released for
formal impacting within FS 30 Sep 09. PO reluctant to release rollout schedule,
need Branch Router details required by mid Oct 09.

29/10 - CP rejected. POL have released schedule. However, will be impacted
due to Post Weekend BIC planning

24/11 - Post wie BC planning has resulted in revised pilot and rollout schedule.
Revised plan already impacted by delays in branch router pilot and putting
revised schedule at risk

12101 — No change

8/2/2010 - All 12 Low Volume Pilot branches trading successfully. Next tranche
of external branches successfully migrated 4/2. Further 10 planned 11/2.

1/3/10 Key issue impacting on live estate (of 152 branches) is screen pauses
and loss of connection to DC. Several causes identified including, incorrect VPX
Server Cache setting (should be 25k actual value 272), possible linkage to
branch router config level, Further fixes to address other causes are included

Any further delays
to the HNGX
rollout result in
Fujitsu missing the
revised exit date
from the Wigan

Datacentres of
31/07/2010. (POL

Cause: Critical requirement

inadequate testing does not

Cause: The current planned
rollout completion date of
21/04/10 slips.

within 01.08 release, these include BAL timeout and premature withdrawal of
Credit card to cause screen freeze. The VPX server change is being
implemented 1 M

and stability of solution

29/10 - Twenty Four/Seven Data Centre support arranged for first three weeks of

Containment: Site visits conducted 27/08/09 with Group Property to confirm
what decommissioning activities are required. FJ will look to minimise the
removal of networks/routers from the sites. Up to 3 week slippage in the plan
can be tolerated without an impact on the exit date.

of decommissioning activities confirmed and can be completed by end of July,
