SSC Monthly POA Snapshot - Dec 2017
General
Everest work continued in December. Work is focused on two possible scenarios:

a) Fully variable charging based on incident volume
b) Banded charging based on incident volume

In each case there is a fixed portion which is designed to cover minimum staff levels required in order to maintain
Post Office Account knowledge and a separate charge level for maintenance work required to support the aging HNGX
estate.

3LS

HNGA

HNGa is now seen as BAU as far as charging is concerned, despite there still being large gaps in the solution. Rollout
speed will impact the current disk maintenance workload (see below).

Post Office Litigation
Mark spent some time showing the KEL system to Court representative Mr Jason Coyne. Overseen by Pete
Newsome. SSC have also supplied various lists of KELs as required.

Disk Maintenance Calls

Significant progress is being made with 2LS resolution rate on these calls reducing the load on 3LS staff by the
production of automation for the 2LS team. I expect this kind of incident to be defined a separate class within the
Everest charging model since it represents a significant part of the overall volume of HNGX incidents.

MI Support
Assisted Fatima with the compilation of the Live Branch Report including explaining how percentages work when
compiling Fl impact information!

Support tool activities

HORIce

Three more free Post Office user accounts added after a request by Pete Thompson. Also added users for two
Hackathon developers (Greg Dash & Nupoor Pandey).

A large volume of work in the HORIce area has been completed for the ServiceNow dashboard and HSS. This is taking
up most of john Simpkins’ time.

ServiceNow
Quite a bit of development to get HORIce monitors data into ServiceNow as a demo to POL. No project code has been
supplied so this is being booked to BAU support.

Horizon Self Service
Hackathon continues (as HSS — Horizon Self Service) working to develop the Query Engine (based upon the WebSmiley
FUJ00219600
FUJ00219600

component of HORIce). No project code has been supplied so this is being booked to BAU support.

Peak
GDC access changes to allow them to take over targeting and development committed to Peak on 11". A login
message on Peak reQinforced the recent red top and explained the changes:

* GDC will be able to read the text of any Peak raised after 13:30 today (11").

* They will not be able to access any evidence unless it has been obfuscated.

+ As per the current process any Peak routed or actioned on a GDC team will grant them full access to
the evidence.

+ Please consider and progress you add to a Peak to ensure that it would not be considered sensitive.

Aged Incidents

There have been a number of approaches to the SSC asking us to remove incidents >90 days old because they
represent over 50% of the overall aged incidents. SSC have explained that the TSD group being analysed (POA-FJ-
PEAK) represents all Peaks that have passed through SSC and then onto other Peak resolver groups (mainly
Development?) where they are probably awaiting a long term fix etc. The action here needs to be with service
managers to chase the individual Peak teams responsible and not the SSC.

SSC Web

A new status has been added to KELs, reviewed. This is being used to mark when a KELs has been reviewed by the KEL
Review Forum. Awaiting the inevitable reporting requirements.

Reference data

Still no news on the Reference Data Proposal which was with the POA IT leadership board (last meeting 15th
November). Understand this will be pushed by the Account in January.

Bank Holiday data supplied by ATOS was incorrect. Flagged by the SSC and corrected data received in time.
Steve Porter is putting together a CP for HNG-A counters on RDT.

Camelot Lottery Cheques

Post Office asked for assistance in understanding why Camelot Lottery Cheques data was on APOP but not on
Credence and POLSAP. It turns out that Atos made a change to the AP-ADC script in October 2017 (the formal data
was not delivered to SV&lI, so the assumption is the Atos IS tested the change on RDT) which resulted in a number of
transactions being aborted after the data had been written to APOPand after the cheque had been handed over. It is
believed that the customer would have been paid when they shouldn’t have been. Atos corrected the script during
December 2017, Fujitsu were not made aware of the issue with the script until the conference call on 04/01/2018.
Fujitsu have provided a report from the APOP data to POL via Quatrix.

PODG

Credence and MDM were cutover to Azure on 19/12/2017. The feeds to the old instance of Credence and MDM in
Belfast were finally decommissioned on 04/01/2018. The cutover and decommission PODG OBC work totals £148K for
Azure, in addition to the £105k for the work completed when the application was to be moved to Accenture Hof D/C.

In addition to this there are PODG OBC changes for the Back Office Application Tower for CFS / CWC / Transtrack /
Success Factors.

Additional charges raised in December
Ref data excess for December £8835.47. Rig deliveries £5429.08. No template changes.

Volumes
The volume of change has dropped this month to 361 changes (449 last month). There was a total of 320 changes that
were classified as BAU vs the monthly quota of 300.

* ‘Branch’ totalled 253 (285 last month) vs monthly quota of 140.
+ ‘Pre-auth’ remains below the monthly quota of 40.
* ‘High Risk’ remains below the monthly quota of 50.

Capacity / Performance management

First meeting held with new POL Capacity Manager Andrew Jacques.
