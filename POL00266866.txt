Introduction

This Joint Statement sets out further areas of agreement between the Experts. The structure of the document captures i) A table of bugs/errors/defects
containing evidence of financial impact upon branch accounts that both experts agree (or indicate if they do not), ii) all expert agreements grouped by
Horizon issue, and iii) additional comments and observations input by the respective expert.

Because of time pressures and the complexity of the issues, we have not been able to address all the Horizon issues in this joint statement. We will issue a
subsequent joint statement addressing those issues we have not yet addressed. For those issues we have addressed in this statement (issues 1, 2, 9, 14 and 15),
the layout and references are not as polished as we would have wished, and there may be further points we need to address in the next joint statement, which
will address the other Horizon issues. We apologise to the court for these shortcomings.

Jason Coyne — In this Joint Statement I have sought to document my agreement or disagreement with Dr Worden in respect of the Horizon Issues. It is my
understanding that this document is not a responsive report to Dr Worden’s supplemental report, therefore I have not provided comments, criticisms or
observations of his report in this Joint Statement. Where Dr Worden seeks to provide rebuttals and responsive comments to my supplemental report, I do not
address them in this document, but seek to focus only on agreement on the Horizon Issues as they are stated in the pleadings. Where an additional statement
under an agreed issue is attributed by me, It is made to clarify or qualify the agreements made in that issue section.

Jason Coyne — Dr Worden wishes to include a table of what he believes are the financial impacts of the Bugs Errors and Defects discovered to date. I have
not considered such a calculation and therefore the data within this table is not agreed.

Robert Worden — I believe this joint statement (and those to come after it) can serve as a concise roadmap for the court, of the areas of agreement and
disagreement between the experts, as they are at the date of issue. As such, this statement should express the disagreements as concisely as possible but
describing the differences between the experts’ opinions with sufficient precision to assist the court. I have attempted to do that.

I would not expect evidence of all

The KEL indicates that, as this
remming issue was caused by a
software bug, PO and FJ wanted
discrepancies to be corrected early to
reassure the Subpostmaster. In my

It therefore seems clear that,
following any reported discrepancy,
reconciliation and a routine Error
Notice would correct it. So, I do not
agree with Mr Coyne's implication at
3.129 that there were potential
discrepancies in branch accounts; or
with his conclusion at 3.131.

The incident arose from a hardware
replacement (probably from a
hardware fault) not from a fault in
Horizon. It is a different kind of
recovery issue.

This conclusion appears to apply
equally to the 88 further Peaks which
refer to this KEL, as noted by Mr

it to the attention of the
Subpostmaster, who would require it

the case of small mismatches, which
he might pass off as an error in the
branch (e.g. of counting stock).

In the first Peak PC0027581, cited at

problem with the underlying Riposte
software, and passed it to Escher. In
September 2000, the problem was
‘Now formally fixed in Build 223

from Escher did not, as it was

1.30 I Bugs affecting I Agreed Review of Peaks and KELs shows that many adverse events, which may arise
branch from defects in Horizon or may not, can be detected by back end monitoring
accounts or reports, without any reporting from the branch. For certain adverse events
it is also often possible by back end monitoring to establish the branches
affected and any financial impact.
1.31 I Extent RW In section 8.7.8 of my report, at paragraph 742, I estimated the mean impact 8.7, 742

of a bug with financial impact on all branches. The table at paragraph 742
contained the 7 bugs which I then thought might impact branch accounts and
estimated the mean impact across those 7 bugs. My conservative estimate,
from the table, was £6000 (para 744), and my central estimate was £2000
(Para 745; changed to £1000 in my supplemental report). I explained at at
para 743 that these estimates were very approximate.

From the discussions with Mr Coyne leading to this joint memorandum, as
summarised in the table of bugs above, there are now 12 bugs which in my
opinion might have had impact on branch accounts. I have therefore re-
estimated the mean financial impact of a bug, using the larger sample of these
12 bugs, with the same method of estimation.

The result of this re-estimate is that the central estimate is again about £2000,
but the conservative estimate has increased from £6000 to £13,300. The
conservative estimate has increased mainly because of the inclusion of the
Data Tree Build bug, described in Mr Coyne’s supplemental report, which
had a large financial impact of about £105,000 (as in the table above). This
large figure now dominates the mean.

The central estimate, as I described at paragraph 745, includes my estimate of
the probability that branches were compensated for any discrepancy, so that
the Subpostmaster would suffer no loss. In my opinion, the data tree build
bug was very prominent (a small number of large losses), and there is a very
high likelihood that branches were compensated for it.

However, the issue of whether or not branches were compensated for a
particular bug is a factual issue, and I do not know what the court will find

for any specific bug. For my conservative estimate, therefore, I assume that
the branches were not compensated for any of these bugs — leading to a larger
total which favours the claimants. With that assumption, the data tree build
bug dominates the average of 12 bugs.

T have included a spreadsheet of this revised calculation, with an explanation
of it, as an annex to this joint statement. The calculation is not agreed
between the experts.

The conservative estimate of the mean impact of a bug has increased from
£6000 to £13800 — just over a factor 2. As a result, my estimate of the
maximum possible proportion of claimants’ claimed shortfalls which might
arise from bugs in Horizon has increased, from 0.181% to about 0.4%. The
maximum is still not sufficient to account for even a small part of the claimed
shortfalls.

Mr Coyne has given no reason why my analysis of the financial impact of
bugs is ‘ultimately flawed’. I corrected the estimates of impact for many
effects, such as shortcomings in the process of creating KELs, archiving
KELs, sampling of KELs, or claimant branch sizes. Mr Coyne has given no
reason why claimant branches should be more prone to bugs, compared with
other branches.

My final estimate of 0.181% (the maximum proportion of claimants’
shortfalls caused by bugs, now altered to 0.4%) includes many conservative
assumptions, designed to favour the claimants. The effect of the conservative
assumptions is to increase the estimate by about a factor of 30, over an
estimate from my best assumptions.

‘Dr Worden’s graph at 813 would actually be consistent with the idea that
bugs were the primary cause of issues’

This is not correct, because the average tenure of a claimant was about 90
months. Therefore, to account for their losses, each claimant would have to
have suffered losses in several months. Their average loss per month (as in
the graph) would then cluster around the mean value of £360 per month. Mr
Coyne has confused individual loss events with the mean loss per month.

This was accounted for in my detailed statistical analysis - which showed that
the evidence is not consistent with bugs as the cause of the shortfalls.

Human errors

RW

Mr Coyne is referring here to remming errors, which are detected
automatically by Horizon and corrected by TCs. So, there is no need
for the Subpostmaster to ‘identifv the cause of that discrepancy’.

I do not agree that support teams ‘still have access to the same

what happened in the branch.

Evidence

RW

There are gaps in the evidence of how those bugs acknowledged by
Post Office were handled.

The main sources of evidence including KELs and Peaks and
witness statements, are necessarily incomplete — especially at this
remove in time.

Horizon Issue 14 — How (if at all) does the Horizon system and its functionality:
a. enable Subpostmasters to compare the stock and cash in a branch against the stock and cash indicated on Horizon? b. enable or require
Subpostmasters to decide how to deal with, dispute, accept or make good an alleged discrepancy by (i) providing his or her own personal funds or
(ii) settling centrally? c. record and reflect the consequence of raising a dispute on an alleged discrepancy, on Horizon Branch account data and, in
particular: d. does raising a dispute with the Helpline cause a block to be placed on the value of an alleged shortfall; and e. is that recorded on the
Horizon system as a debt due to Post Office? f. enable Subpostmasters to produce (i) Cash Account before 2005 and (ii) Branch Trading Statement
after 2005? g. enable or require Subpostmasters to continue to trade if they did not complete a Branch Trading Statement; and, if so, on what basis
and with what consequences on the Horizon system?

for a comparison to be made against the
electronically derived figures held by Horizon.
14.3 Subpostmasters Agreed It is agreed that functionality enabling the

handling discrepancies

Subpostmasters to deal with, dispute, accept or
make good alleged discrepancies is as follows:

At the end of the Trading Period, Horizon reports
to the user the amount of any discrepancy. The
system invites the user to transfer this amount into
the local suspense account and continue to roll
over — or to discontinue this operation.

If, at the end of a Trading Period, there is a
discrepancy (i.e. either a surplus or a shortfall) of
less than £150, the Subpostmaster must 'make
good' the discrepancy — either by removing money
from the till (in the event of a surplus) or by
adding money to the till (in the event of a
shortfall). The ability to make good through
Horizon was also available before 2005 under
Cash Accounting. ‘Making good’ causes the
derived cash position to remain the same and the
actual cash position to change accordingly. The
next Trading Period can then begin with a
balanced account (both physical cash and
electronically recorded). If, at the end of a
Trading Period, a branch has a discrepancy of
more than £150, they have the option to either
make good or settle the discrepancy centrally.
The ability to ‘settle centrally’ was not available
under Cash Accounting. If the Subpostmaster
chooses to settle centrally, they do not have to
physically place cash in the till (in the case of a
shortfall) at the time. Instead, a message is sent to
Post Office's Finance Services Centre and the

discrepancy is moved to a central account. A
Subpostmaster may wish to dispute a discrepancy.
This only appears to have been available post
2005.

The Subpostmaster cannot dispute a discrepancy
on Horizon or record that they have raised a
dispute. This is done through contacting the
helpline.

Trading

Agreed

The experts agree that no technical controls have
been identified within the disclosure that would
indicate Subpostmasters were prevented from
trading if they did not complete a Branch Trading
Statement.

Correction / Dispute
Process

Agreed

The experts agree that the Transaction Correction
Flow Chart 1 [A_19] and Flow Chart 2 Branch
Trading Statement [A_20] documents produced
for the Common Issues trial are reflective of their
understanding of the processes.

14.6

Discrepancies

Agreed

Horizon does not record disputes. It is Post
Office’s back office accounting facilities that
record disputes and make decisions upon
discrepancy investigations and the issuing of error
notices/TCs

[see 15.5 below for further]

Discrepancies /
Investigations

Jc

With the above in mind (14.4), Post Office’s
operational back office accounting processes and
their adequacy were crucial to ensuring branch
accounts were not adversely affected by
discrepancy or error arising from Horizon
generated events (i.c., bugs/errors/defects) or
manual error / lack of policy adherence in respect
of decision-making processes regarding
discrepancy disputes.

15.1

TCs Issued

Agreed

Transaction Corrections arise (in the majority of occasions) as a
result of a either POL or a Subpostmaster identifying an
imbalance/discrepancy.

Between the years of 2006 to 2017 TCs were applied more than
100,000 times each year.

TCs Issued

RW

The smaller figures for 2005 and 2018 in the table at para 928
arose because they were part years. TCs started in 2005, and the
table only reflected part of 2018

928

Erroneous TCs

Agreed

The Transaction Correction process could lead to Transaction
Corrections being issued in error and when disputed, some TCs.
are corrected by issuing another TC (when disputes are upheld).

Smith 1% WS

TCs

Agreed

Post Office does not inspect Audit Data before issuing a TC. As
there are typically more than 100,000 TCs per annum, it would
incur additional cost and delay for Post Office to inspect audit data
before issuing any TC.

TCs

Agreed

When a TC is disputed, we would expect Post Office to
investigate/validate with more data sources than utilised in the
initial determination.

Errors in TCs

RW

Those TCs disputed and still wrongly issued (not upheld), are
probably fewer in number than those disputed and upheld -
because of the careful process of investigation.

Errors in TCs

RW

I have derived an upper limit on the financial impact of errors in
the TC process. The magnitude of the mean financial impact per
branch per month of erroneous TCs is less than £2.

Coyne Refs

Worden Refs

The figure of 77%, taken from Mr Smith’s witness statement, does
not support Mr Coyne’s conclusions up to his para $5.359. It only
shows that for the small proportion of Santander TCs that were
disputed, the resulting investigation found in favour of the
Subpostmaster rather than the PO client.

This does nothing to alter my conclusion in S7 that the losses to
claimants from erroneous TCs were very small, compared to their
claimed shortfalls.

Errors in TCs

The figure of 77% shows that correction by PO of possible errors
by Santander was effective - the opposite of what Mr. Coyne
implies

The experts have still not achieved clarity on the 10,000

of TCs per year.

There is nothing in the Peak to indicate a fault in Horizon, or that
