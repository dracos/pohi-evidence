1 Introduction

1.1 Owner

The owner of the Major Incident Management process at the local POA level is the Fujitsu POA Lead
SDM, Problem and Major Incident.

Objective

The key objective of the procedure is to ensure effective and efficient management of Major Incidents,
through:

e Improvement of communication channels

e Clarification of the need to communicate awareness of potential incidents

« Improved accuracy of reporting of incident status

e Allowing technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident
e Avoiding unnecessary alerting of the customer

e Demonstrating a professional approach to the Post Office

e Provision of clearly defined roles and responsibilities

e Defined reporting and updating timelines throughout a major incident.

e Improved governance

« Assessing which incidents are major and which are ‘Business as Usual’

1.2 Rationale

This document outlines the communication and management procedure and guidelines to be used for
Major Incidents impacting the live estate.

The methodology defined within this document augments the existing SMS framework procedure
presently deployed within the live estate.

The aim of the document is to provide a pre-defined procedure for future major incident communication
and management.

Mandatory Guidelines

It is important to maintain a balance between:

a) Allowing the technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident

b) Avoiding unnecessary alerting of the customer
c) Assessing which incidents are major
The following guidelines should be adhered to.

During the HSD IMT Core Hours (Monday — Friday 08:00 — 18:00 and Saturday 08:00 — 14:00)
the HSD IMT should be the first point of operational contact between Fujitsu and the end user.
Outside these hours the SMC acts as the first point of contact.

Any activity detailed in this document which is assigned to the HSD IMT is handed over to the
SMC outside the HSD IMT Core Hours.

The relevant technical teams who are aware of and monitoring a potential major incident must
page / call the appropriate Major Incident Manager (Duty Manager out of hours) as soon as
possible. This is not limited to major incidents alone, but applies wherever a state other than
Business as Usual has been detected. The Major Incident Manager must in turn communicate
the potential incident, to the POL Service Desk for awareness and monitoring in POL. This is
usually done via the HSD IMT in core hours.

The Major Incident Manager (or Duty Manager out of hours) is responsible for communicating
both up the Fujitsu organisation and across (see appendix 10.3) to their counterpart in POL.
Where this is impractical (e.g. leave, out of hours, unavailable), the initiative should be taken to
jump up the organisation. Of prime importance is that the customer is informed in a timely
manner and at the correct touch point. This communication should be by voice or direct SMS.
The communication should include the date, time, name, nature of problem, severity, if service
affecting, likely impact, and the Fujitsu owner to contact.

The Major Incident Manager (Duty Manager OOH) should also initiate communication using
SMS via the HSD IMT (08.00 to 18.00 Monday to Friday, and Saturday 08.00 to 14.00). Outside
of these hours, the SMS should be via the SMC. The SMS distribution list used is titled ‘SMS
Internal’ and amongst others includes the appropriate members of the POA Operations
Management Team.

3 Definition of a Major Incident

3.1 Incident Classification

As a general rule a Major Incident will be an incident rated as severity level A (critical) in the POA
Operations Incident Management Procedure document (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018), or a series of connected
lower severity incidents which combine to have a significant business impact. However not all incidents
rated at severity level A qualify as a Major Incident as the severity levels do not always reflect the
overall business impact to POL. For example a single counter post office which is unable to trade,
regardless of its business volumes, is rated as a severity A incident.

For simplicity, incidents are classified into three impact levels: High, Medium and Low.

High — An Incident that has occurred with a significant and potentially prolonged adverse impact on POL
business. Typically these incidents will initially require a significant amount of reactive management
before they can be controlled and resolved.

Medium — An incident that has the potential to cause significant impact to POL business but can be
controlled and contained through effective management.

Low — An Incident that requires business attention but if managed effectively will not have significant
impact on POL business.

3.2. Influencing Factors in calling a Major Incident

It is important that a major incident is defined as such because of its business impact on the day when it
occurs, rather than simply being defined as a major incident because it appears on a list. However the
following parameters will also feed into the consideration of whether a major incident should be called:

e Duration, i.e. how long has the vulnerability to service already existed?

e Impact across the estate, including consideration of whether a service is merely degraded or
actually stopped

e Time at which the event occurs in relation to the 24 hour business day
e Time of year - e.g. Christmas / Easter / End of month / quarter

e Anticipated time before service can be resumed

« Impact to POL branches, customers, clients or brand image

e Business initiatives e.g. product launches

3.3 Major Incident Triggers

The criteria below could trigger a major incident, however as detailed in 3.2, the influencing factors must
also be considered. As such the list below is not exhaustive, whilst if an incident occurs which is not
detailed below it should not necessarily be precluded from being declared a major incident.

e Number of Branches not able to provide online services — as defined by POL
«Third party provided service failure — e.g.DVLA, Link, Fujitsu Group

N.B Once the third party service provider has been deemed to be the source of the Major Incident, it
will be managed by either POA or POSD in accordance with whichever organisation manages that
supplier relationship.

3.1.5 Security Triggers
Security major incident triggers are as follows:

e Actual or suspected attacks on the Fujitsu Services Buildings and its resources, POA Network
or Information Systems

e Theft of IT equipment / property, and in particular PIN Pads
¢ Theft of software

e Any PIN Pad Issues that are in breach of FIPS 140-1 level 3 and ISO 9564 1st Edition 1991
section 6.3.1 as specified in the LINK information security standard issued January 2001 (subject
to such dispensations from that standard as LINK may grant from time to time). The main criteria
being as follows:

The purpose of this Standard is to protect the LINK Network, its Members and their
cardholders and ATM owners from attacks designed to compromise sensitive data or
defraud financial institutions and their cardholders. This protection takes into account not
just the direct financial losses that may be incurred but also the potential reputational
damage to the LINK ATM Scheme and its Members and its impact on customer
confidence in LINK and ATMs in general. It is intended to protect the Link Brand:

+ the interests of the Members
+ the interests of the Members' customers
+ the reputation and integrity of the UK cash handling infrastructure

In the event of a Security Major Incident (which may also include PCI Incidents), the POA Security
Manager MUST be alerted who will then follow the Security Incident Management processes, as detailed
in both:

SVM/SDM/PRO/0018 Appendix A

SVM/SDM/PLA/0031 HNG-X Security Business Continuity Plan (defines the actions to be taken
if security violations are identified).

In the event of a Major Incident Security trigger for Fujitsu Services Buildings and its resources, the POA
Security Manager MUST inform the Group Property Security Team who will be alerted either by
telephone on a 24/7 basis or the next working day via our Incident Reporting process and the actual or
potential impact of the incident dictates which route is followed.

The Group Property Security Team then take responsibility for interfacing into the corporate process by
entering reports on to the corporate system

4 Calling the Major Incident

During business hours the Major Incident Manager declares and manages the Major Incident (with
handovers to the OOH Duty Manager where applicable.)

Where the impact of the incident is not immediately obvious, and it is not clear if a Major Incident should
be called, escalation and discussion with the POA Operations management team should occur, and a
collective decision made. If a Major Incident is not called, the incident should be monitored until closure,
to ensure that the impact does not increase to that of a Major Incident.

In the event that multiple services are impacted, multiple Major Incident Managers may be appointed by
the POA Lead SDM, Problem and Major Incident Management, the POA Head of Service Operations or
the POA Head of Service Management, who will remain in this role until incident closure.

Out of hours the OOH Duty Manager is responsible for declaring a Major Incident.

Major incident identi ed?

Incident identified, the definition of an incident is “Any event which is not part of the standard operation of a service and
which causes, or may cause, an interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that service.” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018). An

incident may be reported from within POL domain, a supplier domain or other route

Major Incident Triggers Met?

An initial impact assessment of the incident is undertaken by
members of the POA Service Team taking into account impact
on:

Live Service, Financial Integrity, Business Image

The incident is profiled as a Major Incident as outlined within
this document, including consideration of influencing factors,
e.g. time, geographical coverage, business impact, security,
public perception, duration and relevant business initiatives
coinciding at POL, and decision taken to call a Major Incident.

The Major Incident Manager will consult with the Business
Continuity Plans (see section 0 of this document) to identify if
potential MBCI or MBCI triggers have been met, and inform
the POA Business Continuity Manager if appropriate.

The POL Service Desk will be informed by the Major Incident
Manager of the incident, and the incident will also be escalated
to Service Management / Service Operations team managers,
if this has not already occurred.

With agreement from the POA SDM for the affected service,
or the Duty Manager out of hours, an SMS will be sent to POA
and POL Management alerting to the potential existence of a
Major Incident.

If a Major Incident is not declared then the BAU Incident procedure is followed — the POL Service Desk will be informed
that there is no Major Incident and a closure SMS sent. The POA SDM for the service should ensure that the Incident is re-
impacted during its lifecycle to ensure that the impact has not increased. If, subsequently the incident is declared a Major

Incident, move to box “Incident Investigation and Diagnosis started”.

7.1 Calculating potential LD liability for Major Incidents

Major Incidents which qualify as Failure Events are detailed in the Branch Network Service Description
(SVM/SDM/SD0011). A Failure Event is defined in this document as an event or series of connected
events which causes one or more Counter Positions to be deemed to be Unavailable due to a Network
Wide Failure or a Local Failure. Ongoing failures will be deemed to be part of such a Failure Event until
the Failure Event is closed in accordance with the Incident closure and Major Incident Review process as
detailed in section 7.0.

For a Failure Event the Incident Closure & Major Incident Review Process will require Post Office and
Fujitsu to agree the number of branches and counter positions affected and the duration of the outage
(rounded to the nearest 30 minutes as detailed in the Network Wide Rounding Table below):

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

8 Fujitsu Roles and Responsibilities during a Major
Incident

This section defines the roles and responsibilities individuals and teams have as part of the Major
Incident Escalation Procedure.

8.1. Role of the HSD IMT

The role of the Horizon Service Desk Incident Management Team (HSD IMT) in the event of a Major
Incident is two-fold:

e Receive and log calls from Post Masters, and communicate the progress of investigations to any
Post Masters who call into the desk.

e Send service impact details (to include calls offered, abandoned, queuing) to the Major Incident
Manager. This template should be completed every 15 minutes from the point of declaring a
Major Incident, until the Major Incident Manager asks for this to cease.

8.2 Role of the Major Incident Manager

The primary role of the Major Incident Manager in a Major Incident is to facilitate the management of the
Incident through investigation and diagnosis to resolution, with the aim of making the process as efficient
and effective as possible. Upon determining that a Major Incident has been called, a request for a
Technical Recovery Manager (TRM) will be made to the POA Head of Service Operations, who will
appoint one of his team to be the TRM. The Major Incident Manager acts as the central point for
communication and non-technical information flow, allowing the TRM to focus on the technical situation
and the resolution of the Incident. The Major Incident Manager is also responsible for creating and
maintaining all the associated documentation.

The Major Incident Manager:
e Has responsibility for creating the Major Incident Report
« Manages the communication internally within the POA
« Communicates with the POL Service Desk on the progression of the incident

« Identifies Business and Service impact though discussions with the users, the POL Service Desk
and the HSD IMT — providing this input into the Tech Bridge.

e Calls and chairs the Technical Bridge
e Distributes the Technical Bridge actions provided by the TRM (if appropriate).
e — Liaises with the SSC to update the Service Portal

e Along with the POA Problem Manager, ensures that the TRM provides regular updates on any
longer term corrective actions.

Following the resolution of the Incident, the Major Incident Manager schedules and chairs the Major
Incident Review and creates the Major Incident Report document.

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

8.3 Role of the Problem Manager
The Problem Manager ensures that corrective actions / investigations are tracked and completed
following the major incident.

Any corrective actions arising from the Major Incident Review will be added to the corrective actions log
and tracked through to completion. The updates will be distributed to POL as required, and in the case of
a Security Major Incident associated with PCI failures the POL Security team will also receive a copy of
the report.

8.4 Role of the Technical Recovery Manager

The primary functions of the Technical Recovery Manager are to co-ordinate and manage the restoration
of service, manage the technical teams, and act as the communication point for the technical teams and
third parties. The function will also include managing all longer term technical corrective actions, e.g.
recommendations for improvements to KELs, eventing and configuration.

The Technical Recovery Manager:
* Manages the technical recovery of the Incident — liaising with SDUs and third parties.

« Provides updates on the recovery, when technicians / representatives of technical teams are
unable to attend the Technical Bridge.

«Is the only person to liaise directly with the technical teams, including technical third parties.

e Provides summarised actions from Technical Bridge to the Major Incident Manager, including:
o Current status including impact and risk
o Planned recovery activities including timelines

o Root Cause Analysis, corrective actions, and their corresponding action owners and
timelines (where known)

The TRM will be responsible for attending any meetings and providing appropriate root cause analysis
and corrective action detail. This will also include managing any longer term technical corrective actions
that are documented in the Major Incident Report and will include where appropriate

- any activities for a Service Improvement Plan

- any Changes and MSC numbers

- any Risks

- any Configuration changes

- any improvements to KELS, alerting and /or events

10.5 Escalation Communication Protocol
The primary principle:

Up”
and
“Across

Example:

The Major Incident Manager would escalate up to POA Lead SDM, Problem and Major Incident
Management, and across to the Post Office Service Desk.

Major Business Continuity Incidents (MBC1)
For HNG-X the MBCI triggers are listed in:
« HNG-X Support Services Business Continuity Plan (SVM/SDM/PLA/0001)
e HNG-X Services Business Continuity Plan (SVM/SDM/PLA/0002)
e HNG-X Security Business Continuity Plan (SVM/SDM/PLA/0031)
e HNG-X Engineering Service Business Continuity Plan (SVM/SDM/PLA/0030).

These documents should be referred to as appropriate in the event of Major Incident to determine if
Business Continuity needs to be invoked.

10.6 Security Major Incidents

In the event of a security major incident, the incident procedure as detailed in the POA Customer
Services Incident Management Procedure (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018 Appendix A) must also be followed.

SVM/SDM/PLA/0031 HNG-X Security Business Continuity Plan defines the actions to be taken if security
violations are identified.

10.7 Roles

e Major Incident Manager (MIM). This will by default be either the day time or OOH Duty
Manager. A separate member of the Service Management team may be appointed as the
MIM depending on the situation. The MIM will handle all communications to the HSD IMT
and keep track of time lines. The MIM is also responsible for sending SMS messages but
this can be delegated. The MIM will be assisted by a Technical Recovery Manager (TRM)
for all technical aspects, (including actions for both recovery and longer term changes / risks
and Service Improvement Plans) and also a Problem Manager who will be responsible for
managing any resultant problems to resolution. For the process to be effective, all updates
and information regarding the incident must be fed to the MIM to update the timelines and
report.

e Head of Service Management - is solely responsible for verbal and written communications
with POA senior managers and POL management.
