Hi All.

I have asked Sophie to have a look through MP correspondence just to see whether there are any letters from MPs
about spmr complaints that we were not otherwise aware of. But if there are cases coming through to MPs they are
not coming through to us as far as I am aware.

Best wishes

I had a robust but cordial call with Janet about the note to MPs. She claimed that a number
of cases were still coming through to MPs (but couldn’t put a figure on this when I asked).
She said that James had drafted that last paragraph himself but she would relay our points
to him (hence my follow-up email below to seek to reinforce the changes).

She said that James was still keen to talk to you Paula (this was even before I got onto our
drafting changes). She said next week is no good because it’s recess and they want to get
the email out asap, so she suggested this Thursday between 1.30 and 2.30 (preferably at
2). I explained that you were at an important diversity event but she said James had no
other availability. Looking at the WIL agenda you probably could slip out for a bit during
these times, so let us know what you think so we can confirm with Janet.

Thanks,
Martin

Dear Janet

Thank you very much for the call just now and apologies again that Paula wasn’t available
today to speak with James directly. We will get back to you as soon as possible about
Thursday afternoon.

In the meantime, I have made our proposed amendment to the wording of the note to MPs
in your email below. As explained, our concern was that the language exaggerated the
number of cases which have come through. While it is certainly a significant number and
we are taking those cases seriously, it is important that the number is put in perspective to
avoid unfairly undermining the confidence of sub-postmasters and customers in the
system. We were also concerned about the impression created by the wording at the end
of this sentence — while it is certainly true that some of the stories from subpostmasters
are “harrowing”, these are complex cases with multiple factors at play, whereas the
language at the end of the sentence rather leads the reader to assume that the difficulties
faced by these individuals must be the direct result of the actions of the Post Office. The
point of the Scheme is to consider these cases objectively on a case by case basis.

Many thanks again for the opportunity to discuss the note, and please feel free to call me
back if you have any further questions or comments.

Kind regards,

Martin

Dear Sarah
Thank you for the brief chat just now. I can confirm that James would like to talk
to Paula this afternoon, and will call her mobile at 3.45pm.

One of the matters he wants to touch on is the email he is sending out to MPs, a
draft of which is below. Paula saw an earlier draft and commented upon it. The
email will go with the Annex Paula sent last week. C

Could you please pass this on to her for her thoughts?

Many thanks
Janet

[Draft email to MPs]
Dear Colleague

I had hoped that we might schedule a meeting before summer during which the
Post Office might offer us an update on how the mediation scheme is progressing.
To this end I have been in correspondence with Paula Vennells, the Chief
Executive, to see what might be arranged.

It appears that not a great deal can be added to what was said in our last meeting.
The mediation scheme is progressing, but at a slower pace than any of us would
have liked. Rather than hold a meeting just before Recess that will not reveal more
than we already know, I would rather wait until autumn, but I do want to get a
date in the diary for a meeting then.

I attach a note that Paula has sent which sets out the progress made since our last
meeting. She has reiterated to me that the integrity of the mediation scheme
requires that confidentiality of cases be respected. In her letter to me she has also
said that individual case details may not be shared with us at any point, including
at the end of the Scheme.

I would like to believe that at the end of the Scheme we will be presented with a
report which shows why and how we got to the stage where a significant number
of individuals have come forward with concerns. I do believe that the mediation
scheme has a good chance of righting things, but we shall all need clarity as to
what happened and why, and how it is being put right.
