Introduction & Scope of Document

The Post Office Account Branch Issue Manager is part of Post Office Account Service Delivery Team
and has 2 key areas of responsibilities

Reactive: The BIM is involving in an ongoing Incident / Problem investigation
which require an on-site presence to fully investigate & diagnose the fault,
when other Service Management processes and procedures have exhausted
their normal limits of investigation.

As a result, the impact of the problem on Post Office business will be
minimised, and service levels/customer satisfaction is maintained. Root causes
to problems will be identified, and actions applied to ensure that wherever
possible the circumstances do not recur. The Root Cause is an input into the
BIM proactive responsibilities.

Proactive: The BIM is also responsible for analysing trends and anomalies
experienced at Branch level. These can be indicative of estate wide issues,
and therefore require investigation. Whilst the BIM can be involved in the
investigation the responsibility may lie within another SDU.

Issues, or potential issues, may be identified to the BIM either by a direct referral or via one of the Client
or FJ-S Support and Review forums attended by the BIM.

The Branch Issue Management role is administered by the allocation of two BIM territories, North and
South. However, the ‘boundaries’ are fluid with respect to the workloads and operational requirements of

the POA.

The aim of this document is to detail the BIM Processes and functions how the BIM interacts with other
Fujitsu Services POA processes and SDU'’s in order to investigate and resolve stranded issues.

2 __BIM Reactive Responsibilities

In the event of an ongoing Incident / Problem investigation, during which other Service Management
processes and procedures have exhausted their normal limits of investigation, the Incident will be
referred for a BIM visit. The BIM will attend site and investigate the issues at the branch, looking for root
cause and other previously non-identified issues, which may contribute to the branch incident. The BIM
looks at environmental, system and configuration elements of the branch.

As a result, the impact of the problem on Post Office business will be minimised, and service
levels/customer satisfaction is maintained. Root causes to problems will be identified, and actions
applied to ensure that wherever possible the circumstances do not reoccur. The Root Cause is an input
into the BIM proactive responsibilities.

2.1 The BIM Referral Process

The BIM Referral Process is the process which must be followed to engage a BIM in the investigation of
ongoing Fujitsu Services related system problems that affect individual or groups of Post Office
Branches.

The instigation of all reactive investigations within the Branch Issue Management Process is via the BIM
Referral Form (see appendix 1). This document must be completed by the team raising the request and
should provide a complete history of issues and previous investigations.

(oe) Branch Issue Manager — Issue Referral Process &
FUJITSU COMMERICAL IN CONFIDENCE
Process Description
Number
1 Originator forwards BIM completed Referral Form

The Originator forwards a completed BIM Referral Form via E-mail to the BIM. The
originator could be from any of the Fujitsu Services SDU’s or another SDM appointed by the
SDM-M. If the referral is direct from POL-SCT then the referral will have to have been pre-
authorised by the SDM-M

All sections of the Referral form must be fully completed. The details within the form are the
basis on which the BIM investigations will be based. It is vital that the contact details are
fully completed. During the investigation the BIM will have to check the actual on-site
details against the reference material provided by the SDU / SDM. If this information has not
been provided the BIM is required to return the referral to the originator, and no further
action can be taken until the referral has been accurately and appropriately completed.

2 Joint Visit?
Is a joint required? If yes move to box 7. If No move to box 3

3 Review and Assess

BIM reviews the referral form and suggests alternative actions or previously untried options.
In this case the referral will be returned to the originator with an explanation.

Unresolved queries may be referred to the SDM-M for arbitration

4 Valid Referral?

Once the referral has been validated the BIM considers the best way forward and in
particular how best to investigate the issues as defined.

Should a referral be rejected; an e-mail will be sent by the BIM to the SDM (c.c. the SDM-M)
and to HSD-IMT

In the case of the referral having been received from POL, should rejection be necessary,
e.g. if the issues are beyond FJ-S remit to investigate or comment upon, then this will be
detailed verbally and supported by an e-mail to POL-SCT

5 Schedule Visit with Postmaster

BIM contacts branch and schedules the visit with the Postmaster, or Officer in Charge. The
visit should be scheduled as soon as is possible.

The BIM should clarify why the visit is being scheduled, what is likely to be involved and the
expected outcome.

The BIM will then advise HSD-IMT, via e-mail or exceptionally verbally, of the dates and
time. HSD-IMT will update the Daily Report.

6 Is a date provided?

If a visit has already been pre-scheduled by POL and subsequently passed to FJ-S and the
BIM, the BIM will, where reasonable, attempt to accommodate the pre-arranged visit
timings.

7 Discuss / Agree options for a visit

If this is achieved then go to 8.

If this is not possible then the BIM will advise the originator of alternative available dates
and times so as they may take this up with POL. Go to 7

8 Agreed?

FUJITSU COMMERICAL IN CONFIDENCE

The dates should be advised as at 5

9 BIM or Joint visit

The BIM visit takes place at the pre-agreed time and for the duration in keeping with that
required to resolve the referred issues. This may involve protracted working on site at
Branches on one or more days, and possibly outside of normal working hours. Such access
or permissions as may be required will be brokered by the BIM with the Postmaster and if
necessary escalated to POL-SCT for their sanctioning/ support.

If required accesses and or permissions cannot be obtained by the BIM from the
Postmaster, then the BIM must immediately inform the SDM-M and POL-SCT defining the
situation that has been discovered on site that was not detailed in the referral and did not
appear during the pre-visit investigations

10 Scheduling / Confirmation
The proposed visit date can be accommodated. All parties will be informed as at 5

11 Previsit work by the BIM

Prior to any visit the BIM researches the background of the Referral and pre-plans their
actions, assembling (where necessary) any equipment, testers, detectors or other supporting
equipment that will be used to support the investigation.

Principal sources of supporting information would typically include interrogation of
PowerHelp call histories, gleaning additional information from POA SSC, or Core Services
Field Management Services

12 Qutput from the vi:

Information gleaned from a Branch visit, actions taken to rectify a defined problem or
activities required to progress the issues are be communicated back to the SDM by the BIM.

The BIM may, if there is a greater business benefit, choose to provide a ‘live’ update to the
referring SDM.

The SDM should act upon the information provided and in instances where the BIM is
working remotely undertake to communicate the information required for Daily Report
Databases or Conference calls to all interested parties. Such mails as are produced must be
copied back to the BIM.

All updates provided must be clearly identified to HSD-IMT so as they can be applied
to the Daily Report Database for inclusion in the present reporting period

13 Resolved?

If the identified issues have been addressed and are resolved then the issues will be
monitored by the referrer for an agreed period after the visit (one month in the case of the
BIM). After that period, providing there has been no reoccurrence, the referral will be closed.

If there are still outstanding issues relative to the referral then go to 14

14 If, following a visit to a Branch the circumstances are found to be significantly different to
those advised or root cause analysis reveals that it would not be possible for the BIM to
progress matters to conclusion, the referral will be returned with comments to the originator.
The issue may then be progressed either through the normal Problem Management Process
or reviewed with POL by the originator

2.1.3. Communication of Updates.

The BIM will ensure that all pertinent information is communicated back to the SDM as soon as possible.
The initial update will be verbal so as to allow the SDM to then communicate the updates to POL. Where
the identified issues are not within the FJ-S remit to progress the BIM will also advise POL directly of the
specific circumstances. In situations where the BIM may be directly moving on to another issue or
location, a fuller feedback in terms of the completed referrals or fuller e-mails will be provided to the
SDM on an as soon as possible basis allowing for the working constraints of the BIM role.

3 Proactive BIM Process

The BIM is also responsible for analysing trends and anomalies experienced at Branch level. The BIM
will review the monthly statistics i.e. The Branch League Tables to identify exceptionally high instances
of call numbers from Branches or other possible indicators of potential issues. These can be indicative
of estate wide issues, and therefore require investigation.

These investigations may lead to phone calls to the branch to glean extra information or, if warranted, a
site visit. If a site visit is required the BIM will inform POL-SCT of their intention to visit so as to ensure
that POL are aware and can advise of any ‘external’ (non-FJ-S issues) factors of which could prevent a
visit. Whilst the BIM can be involved in the investigation the responsibility / ability to progress may lie
within another SDU. In this case the BIM will liaise with the other SDU’s to ensure progression.

3.1 Information Sources and Interfaces

In order to identify possible areas of concern various potential indicators are reviewed by the BIM. These
include:

e The Branch League Table — used to identify specific problem offices over a defined period, and
to endeavour to identify trends or Branches affected by similar issues

e Rural Office Strategy —- monitoring in conjunction with POL the service and satisfaction levels
with the Rural Office network. This information is available as a sub-set of the Branch League
Table

e Potential or actual issues raised by:
o FMS Engineers
o POL Field Team Representatives
o National Federation of Sub Postmasters
o Other internal Service Delivery Units within FJ-S
o Concerns raised by FJ-S CS Service Introduction Team
o POA Business Development Group
o Complaints Management Team

3.2 BIM attendance to Business Support Forums

The BIM is required to attend both the internal and client facing service support forums so as to provide
feedback to the SDM's and SDU'’s of findings and considerations as experience in Post Office Branches.

The forums normally attended include:
. The Branch Services Operational Review Forum (BS-ORF) — POL and FJ-S

. The Branch Services Service Forum (BS-SF) — Fujitsu Services

4 Branch Incident Manager Interfaces
4.1 HSD—-IMT

4.1.1. Roles and Responsibilities

The Incident Management Team is the normal point of contact for the BIM with respect to requesting
information about, or activities at a Branch.

HSD-IMT are used as a live interface to generate Help Desk calls so as to prompt required Horizon kit
replacements or to communicate issues which need to be addressed by Fujitsu Services.

4.1.2 Daily Report update

A daily service status report is compiled and submitted to the client, which forms the basis for the
conference calls. HSD-IMT administers the Daily Report Data Base which generates this information.

Updates required for this report are communicated by the BIM to HSD-IMT verbally if the BIM is still on
site at a Branch or travelling onwards to another job. The BIM endeavours to get all updates to the HSD-
IMT so as they can be included in the reports from the same day’s business. The BIM will get additional
supporting information to the SDM as soon as possible. Items that HSD-IMT should include in the Daily
Report updates will be highlighted in bold text

4.1.3. Complaints

Complaints are handled through the Complaints Process managed by the SDM-M (See reference in
Related documents). Complaints received by the SDM-M or the nominated Service Delivery Manager
may be passed to the BIM’s for further investigation.

In this case the SDM-M will detail a service delivery team member to complete a referral form. The BIM
will review this as per the detailed BIM process, but responding to the referrer as well as the HSD-IMT
where necessary.

4.2 Branch Network Service Team

4.2.1 Roles & Responsibilities

This team will produce the referrals relative to the provision of the on-line services. The completed
referral will include all the details relative to the branch. The referral will include all the details as listed in
the referral form. Since the accuracy of this information is crucial to the investigations, incomplete
referrals will be returned to the referrer.

The supporting information section will include a complete history in chronological order of all preceding
events and findings from all SDU’s previously engaged in trying to address the issues

4.2.2 Complaints

The BNST may advise the BIM of complaints in relation to an element of their area of service delivery. If
a complaint is passed to the BIM it will be accompanied by a referral form.

FUJITSU COMMERICAL IN CONFIDENCE

4.3. POA Service Introduction

The BIM may be requested to support and advise upon the introduction of new services or to provide
field support for development trials

The referrer, requesting BIM support, will complete a referral form (See Appendix A.1) so as to define
the location, contact details, history to date and the routes for feedback for information gleaned.

4.4 POA Development

Products and Services being trialled by POA Development with the client occasionally require FJ-S
perspective feedback. BIM’s will support these exercises as representatives of the POA business.

All requirements will be notified via a referral form. It is the responsibility of the referrer to ensure all
contact details are included and that any POL personnel who will also present are aware of the BIM’s
presence and objectives

The BIM may also be asked for feedback as to the viability or practicality of the introduction of new
products or services with respect to their specialist knowledge of Post Office counter operations,
processes and service delivery methodology.

4.5 Core Services - FMS

The BIM interfaces with Core Services — Field Management Service both at management and field
levels. The overall management effectiveness is discussed and reviewed at the BSS-ORF on a monthly
basis. More urgent issues are discussed directly with the management by phone in advance of an
investigation or from site where clarity is required.

BIM’s work with FMS field support engineers on site where potentially kit replacement may be required.

If a BIM raises a call, via HSD-IMT, for kit replacement at a branch; FMS must complete this request in
full. The BIM will be in possession of specific or specialist knowledge of the situation and will be
requesting replacements accordingly.

BIM requests for Horizon kit replacement are not covered by the normal SLA’s. They are logged as FJ-S
requests.

All requests are monitored by HSD-IMT and the BIM is advised when the work has been completed. The
BIM will verify with the Postmaster that the required works have been completed in full as per the BIM
request so as to gain permission to close the call. All non-conformances will be escalated to the SDM-M
and Core Services management

When a BIM has specialist knowledge of new products or services or has suggested a Service
Improvement that is to be adopted by FMS, the BIM will work with FMS to train the trainers within FMS.

4.6 Post Office Ltd Service Continuity Team

The BIM has direct links with POL through the POL-SCT interface. POL-SCT and the BIM openly
discuss issues or potential issues to gain the respective business perspectives and to agree a way
forwards. Initial contact is typically verbal, backed up where necessary, by e-mail.

Should POL-SCT wish to raise issues with the BIM formally for investigation then all referrals will be
instigated via the referral form. These issues are investigated as per the defined process with the
exception that at 14, the originator will be from POL and the issues are likely to be Post Office only. At
this point POL will e-mail the BIM to advise this so as the BIM may close the FJ-S investigations
appropriately.
