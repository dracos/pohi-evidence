Hi Katie,

Attached is the APADC Reference Manual, which describes the APADC functions and gives an overview of the
recovery process (subject of your second email). This document describes the generic APADC functionality rather
than the specific sequence of APADC functions used to implement the various Drop & Go transactions — to my
knowledge no such document exists for Drop & Go.

It’s the first time I have seen this peak, but in normal operation, live incidents relating to APADC are sent to the
resolving team, who are the Information Services Team, which is an Atos function lead by Erika Smithurst, cc’d.

@Smithurst, Erika : can you confirm if PCO273234 was ever received by the Information Services Team? I'll send on
details of the PEAK separately.

I have helped the Information Services Team with resolution to Drop & Go live incidents in the past, as I have some
awareness of the operation of the scripts due to the testing performed of previous changes.

I agree with your summary in terms of frequency of Top Up’s made during Count Mails... The Count Mails
transaction was I believe intended to be a quick transaction for the clerks to take receipt of a number of Drop & Go
items, registering the number of items received, and issuing a receipt to the customer for the number of items.
The clerk would then use a separate transaction (called Start Mails) to process the items individually after the
Customer had left the office — i.e. at a quiet moment when no other customers are present. It is only at processing
the individual mails items would a clerk identify whether there was sufficient balance on the account to process
the items. So it would be unusual for a customer to request a top up as part of the Count Mails process — i.e. they
would need to have prior knowledge of their account balance before doing the Count Mails process to know that a
Top Up would be needed in order to process all of the items.

Kind regards,

Atos James Brett

Hi James

Firstly, thank you for coming back to me so quickly in relation to the below with such a thorough response. I have a
couple of, hopefully small, follow-on questions:

1. Is there a document that explains the different AP-ADC script functionality and/ or the AP-ADC functionality
generally?

(often with FJ we are able to obtain a design document that explains different scripts and functions — if you have a
document it would therefore be helpful but I appreciate from your email below which explains that the analyst has left
the business and that there is no available documentation that this is unlikely)

2. In terms of PC0273234 from August 2018, can I just check my understanding is correct:

a. Page 3 of the Peak identifies the issue as being to do with the AP-ADC script and includes the
keystrokes and messages from the Counter to assist ATOS. Your email below confirms that this is the
first time you have seen the keystroke log evidence. Can I check whether or not the incident was
actually passed from FJ to ATOS? If so, can you please provide us with copies of any relevant
correspondence/ details that were provided.

b. I understand that you are now in the process of urgently fixing the CountMails script as a result of
reviewing the keystroke log evidence. If it is the case that this log evidence was previously provided to
ATOS (as the Peak indicates), can I ask why it is only now that this issue is being fixed?

3. Are you able to comment on how often the Top Up functionality in the CountMails script would be likely to have
been used in practice?

Is it the case that this would only be used in unusual events, for example when the customer wants to leave a number
of items with the branch to process later AND then also purchases a Top Up at the same time? We're keen to try to
show that ATOS fixed the majority of the problem here and that the issue with the CountMails script was unlikely to
have manifested in practice very frequently.

Subject: Re: URGENT: Bug 28 - Drop and Go Bug [WBDUK-AC.FID123822914]

Hi Katie,

To put the response below into context, AP-ADC (Automated Payment - Additional Data Capture) are a
series of modular functions that are provided with the Horizon codeset. The APADC functions allow control
of the user interface and allow transaction designers to build an 'APADC transaction script' which calls a
series of APADC functions to capture transactional data. For example; a 'NameLong' function displays a GUI
on Horizon to capture all of the individual elements of a Name (e.g. Title, forename, middle initial,
surname) ona single screen. Adding NameLong, along with various other functions, to a transaction

script allows us to build complex transactions without requiring counter code changes by Fujitsu.

The fix deployed in April 2018 corrected the issue with two known Drop & Go functions, namely;

1) OpenAccount - An APADC transaction script that captures and transmits data when a Customer wants to
Open a Drop & Go Account. As part of the Account Opening journey, the APADC script displays a prompt to
ask the customer if they want to top up the balance of their account at the same time, and if so, processes
the account top up.

WBD_001451.000003
WBONO0001581
WBONO0001581

2) Balance&TopUp - An APADC transaction script that captures and transmits data when a Customer wants
to Top Up the balance of a Drop & Go Account.

From the keystroke log evidence in PCO273234 (which I have seen for the first time today), I can see that
the transaction being attempted is a different Drop & Go Function, namely;

3) Count Mails - An APADC transaction script that captures the number of items that a Customer wants to
leave with the branch to process later.

From the keystroke logs I can see that the Count Mails script also offers the Customer the opportunity to
Top Up their account as part of the Count Mails transaction. Atos were unaware of this additional
mechanism to perform a top up at the time the fix was deployed in April 2018, therefore no changes were
made to the Count Mails APADC transaction script. Atos responded to an original incident relating to the
Balance&TopUp journey. A fixed was identified and this was also applied to the OpenAccount script as we
were aware that OpenAccount also offered Top Up facilities. We missed the fact that Count Mails also offers
Top Up facilities, and therefore the fix will also need to be deployed to the Count Mails transaction as a
matter of urgency. The original author of the suite of Drop & Go transaction scripts was a Post Office
Business Analyst who has since left the business. There is no documentation available that would

have clearly identified a link to Top Up within the Count Mails transaction.

The statement in the test report alludes to the fact that there are existing issues with Recovery which were
still evident after the fix to the Top Up problem was implemented. As the fix successfully resolved the
Account Opening and Top up issue, and did not introduce additional issues during recovery, the fix was
deployed. For context, Recovery is a process that is triggered whenever the Horizon counter system has
problems, specifically;

a) the counter PC crashes midway through a transaction or

b) loss of network connectivity occurs and the counter PC cannot communicate with the data centre. In this
instance Horizon automatically logs the user out.

On Horizon PC restart and/or user log in - Horizon checks to see if any transactions were in progress at the
point of PC/comms failure (by checking for incomplete transaction records in a 'recovery' transaction table
held within the data centre). If records are found, Horizon then triggers a Recovery APADC transaction
script. The transaction designer can create bespoke recovery scripts for each transaction type. The purpose
of the script is to make online calls to third party systems if required, and prompt the clerk for input (e.g.
‘was cash payment taken for the transaction before failure’? or 'was a receipt produced?'). Based on the
information received from the clerk or third party, the recovery script can then complete the original
transaction if required, or finish cleanly if no recovery actions are required. The clerk can then continue
with their business.

I've just received a separate call relating to recovery last week and have been provided keystroke logs that
detail the issue. This issue was originally raised as a Service Incident, but the resolving team (Information
Services) were unable to identify the issue. As I have some awareness of the Drop & Go transaction scripts, I
agreed to look into the issue amongst other workload. I will prioritise this now and will work with

the resolving team to implement a fix to the Count Mails transaction.

Hi James

Thank you for sending through the test report and for your time during our call last month, both of which have been
really useful. I have a couple of very important, but hopefully small, follow-on questions that I'd be grateful if ATOS
could come back to us on this week, ideally tomorrow:

Peak PC0273234, attached, indicates that a further instance of the issue occurred in August 2018, four months after
the changes to the scripts were released to live on 19 April 2018. Can ATOS please confirm:

a. If this was a further instance of the problem or an unrelated problem.

b. If this was a further instance of the problem, why it occurred after the earlier fix? Was it the case that
the script didn't go live in April 2018? Was it the case that it wasn't released to all branches?

We need a full response to these points, together with relevant supporting documentation to evidence how ATOS dealt
with the August 2018 issue, as currently it looks as though a fix was implemented that didn't work in practice.

What does the APADC script do?
What does the Open Account script do?

Section 3 of the Test Report, extract below, is confusing and implies as though there is a separate issue here. Can you
explain the below note please as simply as possible for us?

Note: Recovery scenarios working same as earlier. We observed that with the transaction
where cash was not taken from the customer horizon behaved correctly, processing the zero
value transaction. But the customers Drop & Go account has the increased the balance. This
is the live behaviour and not connected with this fix.

Whilst writing, a separate query has arisen that you may be able to help me with. This relates to an issue involving the
ATOS recovery script. I may need to send you some more information but I wondered as an initial point whether you
would be able to explain what the recovery script does please?

Kind regards

Hi Katie,

Attached is the test report issued by a member of my team at the time of the issue resolution.

Following review of the test report, the Information Services Team released the change as follows;

These script versions were processed as a single change RADC/1804/006, which was submitted, processed

and loaded by Fujitsu on 11/04/18.

This change was released to live on 19/04/18 (ver18065)

Katie,

I have spoken to the person who made the change and here are summary answers. If you want to call to

talk these through with us please do call me.

1. How the issue was fixed

« Atos were alerted to the error by Fujitsu on 2 March 2018.

WBD_001451.000007
WBONO0001581

WBONO0001581

e Previous errors had occurred but this was the first time that Fujitsu were able to capture the key logs.
This enabled Atos to recreate the error and identify the bug.

© Once this was identified a fix was developed, tested and delivered into production using the normal

change management processes.

Delivery to live took place on 19 April 2018.

2. An explanation of the issue

© The underlying issue was that the system did not manage time-outs for Drop and Go properly. When
a message was sent to a banking system and no reply was received the Horizon transaction carried on
‘assuming’ that a reply had been received.

© The fix ensured that the Horizon system waited for the response and where none was received put up
and error message so that the transaction could be safely redone.

David

1. How the issue was fixed.

2. A simple explanation of the issue — currently we have " Reconciliation between the Horizon feed and the
Accenture CDP system identified that only one top-up had been received by Accenture CDP but two were being
shown it the Horizon Batch Feed. The second Horizon transaction matched the CDP transaction, confirming
the problem was with the first transaction." — it would be helpful if this could be expanded on/ explained as fully
as possible.

Happy to have a call if the above and attached are still unclear — I can be free for a call between 3.30 and 4.30 today if
you let me know when is best for you.

. One of the bugs that we need atos' support with has been called the 'Drop and Go' bug. Fujitsu have confirmed they
are not aware of the Drop and Go business process and are therefore unable to comment on whether the issue was
caused by user error or a fault with the APADC script. Ideally we want to understand what happened in this particular
