Subject: GLO Tuesday

Tim, Tom
We have an hour together at BEIS on Tuesday so we can join together our bilateral conversations. I am
talking to Glenn Hall on Monday, as discussed. I won’t do a paper for obvious reasons but I think the agenda

is as follows:

1. Prioritised outcomes
2. Strategy

* Tone
¢ Ground we are fighting on
* Criticism of claimants

3. Advisors

* Recusal
UKG100009416
UKGI00009416

« Appeal

Trials 3 &4 -QCs

* Solicitors

« Independent advice

4. People

Running the GLO
* Mediation

5. Other litigation

Starling

Does that work for both of you?

Many thanks Al
