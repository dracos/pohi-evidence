Start time: Units:

Had a telephone conversation with Ann Chambers following our exchange of e-mails.

Basically, she felt uncomfortable commenting on any of the calls other than those she was
involved in. Agreeing with her that she can only give evidence about what matters she was
involved in and that if she was uncomfortable with the other matters, then Brian would get
the contact details of the HSH Supervisor who could give evidence of that. We will therefore
cut paragraphs 7-25 inclusive and 31-39 inclusive from her Witness Statement. Paragraphs
4-6 we will probably cut but she will need to see whether she feels comfortable with that.

7(a) we will probably leave as it isn’t really relevant and paragraph 40 in the Conclusion she
will have to review to see if she really feels properly able to say that. Ann will go over the
Statement and also put it more into her own words and explain the limits of her involvement.
She will come back to me tomorrow.

Time engaged including Attendance Note - 18 mins.
