Hi Matthew
POL Security have directed me towards you. I’m trying to obtain some transactional information that is not included in
standard ARQ records. Security have advised me that a change order is needed. I have no idea if this is correct, how I

might follow that process and what it entails/costs.

Fujitsu have advised that I need to interrogate “raw” logs to obtain response codes. I’ve been advised to request “Any
TIP feed files for Credence on 23/10/12 with a file name starting with “W_297036.TP_”.

If there is a cost it may be worth investigating whether it would be beneficial to pay for individual requests or to include
in bau reporting — or not get it at all of course!

Appreciate any guidance.
