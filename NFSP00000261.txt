Dear Executive Officer

Having been putting pressure on the Automation Director for some information
regarding the Horizon Roll Out, I am sure you will be keen to see a letter which we
have received which sets out the position following the review held by Post Office
Network Unit.

Hopefully a regular dialogue will soon be established at territorial level in order to
assist members to overcome the difficulties they may well experience as their offices
are automated.

Please let me know if there is any further information you require.

Yours sincerely

COLIN BAKER

Dear Colin

In my note of 6 January I promised to let you have details of the exercise carried out
just before Christmas. I attach a copy of the Research Services report.

This research is consistent with other feedback both structured and otherwise to
which countermeasures are either in place or are about to be implemented and
which I outline further below. This kind of research reflects a continuing
comunitment to listen to the reactions of those at the sharp end of implementation
throughout the roll out.

One of the first decisions that I took after becoming Automation Director was to
create National Roll Out as a project and to identify a senior manager with extensive
experience of the network to lead it. I was delighted , therefore, to be able to
announce the appointment of Don Grey as National Roll Out Project Manger just
before Christmas. With Don at the helm I have absolute confidence that the listening
process will continue and will inform continuous improvement throughout the roll
out.

The feedback points in the direction of training, balancing and help desks as the
major improvement areas with balancing very much the common theme. However,
in each of these areas outlets are more or less evenly split between those who think
we've got it right as opposed to wrong. The trick to be pulled off is to improve
matters for those who believe we need to improve without “turning off” those who
think we've got it right.

Improvements ...../2.

Improvements to training have already been implemented particularly that related to
balancing and there is a small improvement in the reaction to training over the live
trial. A pre-training event has been introduced for those offices with least experience
of computers and the first benefiting from this will go live towards the end of March.
Additionally a guide to balancing has been produced and is about to be distributed.
This has been tested on a number of offices and favourably received.

Support for balancing is to be significantly increased. All first balances will be
supported by Horizon Field Support Officers. RNM clusters are being mobilised to
support subsequent balances. RNM clusters, for whom supporting the roll out
becomes a major objective, are to be supplemented with additional resource for this
purpose. This RNM support will be targeted to offices on the basis of feedback from
the Help Desk so that support gets to where it is most needed.

Our activity with ICL Pathway has , amongst other things, concentrated on
improvements to the expert cash account help desk domain within HSH. This has
very much been a process of continuous improvement and a further package of
initiatives was agreed at the beginning of this month.

Research Services have been tracking the impact that implementation has on an
office. This is called the “coping curve”. ] am pleased to be able to say that there has
been a stepped improvement in this coping curve since the live trial which is proof
that the measures introduced are beginning to bite. This will be closely monitored to
ensure that the measures more recently or about to be introduced continue to reduce
the impact on offices. I know that Don Grey intends to share this data with you ona
regular basis.

Iam particularly pleased that 90% of respondents found Horizon easy to use and
that 80% were either very or fairly satisfied with the automation programme, up
from 56% from those offices in the live trial. I believe this reflects the positive
attitude of the network and your members to Horizon without which it would not
have been possible to get this far or to face the major challenges ahead.

1, Summary
1.1 Introduction

This report gives the results of 330 telephone interviews with staff and agents
whose offices have taken part in the Horizon roll in the autumn of 1999. In
these interviews they were asked their opinion on different aspects of the
Horizon system, the various types of support available (including manuals
and helpdesks) and their overall satisfaction with the automation programme.

1.2 Results and Conclusions

Results on almost all aspects of Horizon are mixed. Some staff and sub
postmasters are getting to grips with the system and are happy and satisfied
whilst others are struggling and continuously having problems. There are no
obvious patterns by office type, IP area, number of counter positions or the
length of time since migration.

However, where comparisons have been possible, these results are more
favourable than the results from the live trial research last June. This
improvement in results indicates that lessons have been learnt from the live
trial and that the remedial action taken has improved perception of several
aspects of Horizon. However, the post office should not rest on its laurels and
there is still room for further improvement.

The main message coming through is that they are not getting enough
training. They are mainly happy with what the one and a half days they
received, but the training on balancing is not long enough for their needs.

This has knock on effects in other areas where greater support as they then
lack confidence when doing their subsequent balances and require more
support from their HFSO and RNM. Also when asked about the user guide
and helpdesks there is a feeling that if they had been trained adequately
problems with these support areas would not be such an issue.

The other area for concern is the helpdesks. There is confusion over which
number to call, which is compounded by them being passed back and forth
between helpdesks. There is a problem getting through to the Horizon system
helpdesk in particular and the service from both appears to be lacking in
terms of consistency and level of knowledge.

1.3 Recommendation

It is strongly recommended that the length of time allocated to balancing in
the training course is extended, since there is anecdotal evidence to suggest
that economising at this stage causes problems further down the line in terms
of the additional support required.

Work is also under way to measure the level of service given by the helpdesks
so that improvements can be made.

2. Introduction and background

At the end of August 1999, national roll out of Horizon commenced. By the
time installation was suspended at the end of November 1999 (due to
pressures on post offices in the run up to Christmas), a total of 1856 post
offices had had the Horizon system installed. National roll out is due to
recommence at the end of January 2000.

3. Objectives

The objective of the research was to evaluate how these 1856 offices have
found the Horizon system, in order to identify any potential problems before
national roll out recommences. The major aspects of Horizon were to be
covered, including the various types of support available. A copy of the
questionnaire used can be found in appendix 1. A similar questionnaire was
asked of the Live Trial offices in June 1999, so where possible results of the
two have been compared.

4, Methodology

Due to the limited time available staff and sub postmasters were contacted via
telephone. Also because of the additional pressures post office staff are under
in the roll up to Christmas, the interviewing took place between Friday 17
December and Thursday 23" December, as anecdotal evidence suggested that
offices were slightly quieter.

During these 4 days 600 post offices were telephoned which elicited 330
successful interviews. This is a large enough sample to be statistically

representative of the 1856 offices which have Horizon.

The interviews were split by contract type as follows:

Contract type Percentage of I number of
respondents _I respondents

6. Summary of results

Three quarters of respondents (74%) felt that they had been kept well
informed prior to installation. Nearly half (48%) respondents stated that
installation process caused only a slight inconvenience to there office, whilst a
further 21% said it caused no inconvenience. The main reasons for
inconvenience were because it caused a major disruption to the office; and
having workmen in the way.

Opinion was split on the training received with 50% saying that the training
was good and 50% saying it was poor. Reasons given for dissatisfaction were
that there was not enough training generally, not enough training on
balancing, not enough time allowed and that the training they had received
was too fast.

The majority of respondents (91%) found the Horizon system easy to use,
because it was straightforward and fool proof, but that it had taken time to
get used to it. Nearly a fifth (19%) of respondents are finding balancing using
Horizon very difficult and a further quarter (24%) are finding it fairly
difficult. The main reasons given were that balancing was time consuming
and slower than their previous method, and they were having problems.

Just over half (55%) of respondents found the Horizon user guide easy to use,
whilst nearly a quarter (24%) were unable to comment due to lack of use,
because they were using alternative sources to resolve their problems.

Those respondents who've had support from their RNM rate them highly
with 73% thinking the support is fairly or very good. Reasons include them
being helpful, explaining things and answer questions, and also because they
are readily available if needed, only a phonecall away. However 14% have not
received any support from their RNM. Three quarters (76%) of respondents
are happy with the support they get from their HFSO, saying they are
excellent and helpful.

There is some confusion (13%) over which helpdesk to call. Satisfaction with
the Horizon System Helpdesk is mixed. 59% are satisfied to some extent.
Reasons for dissatisfaction includes the time to answer the call, being passed
around between operators, the lack of knowledge of operators, the variability
of service depending on who you get, and the number of initial questions.
Nearly a third (32%) of respondents were unable to comment on the National
Business Service Centre because they had not used it or were unsure what it
was. Reasons for dissatisfaction include taking a long time to answer the
phone, the variability in the service, depending on who answers, and being
passed around between operators.

In general, 80% were satisfied to some extent with the automation
programme, this is an improvement compared to 56% satisfaction in the live
trial research. 80% of respondents also believe that in the long term Horizon
will have a positive impact on the post office’s business.

More than half (57%) of respondents felt that back office processes were easier
with Horizon. However, 56% of respondent felt it was more difficult to serve
customers with Horizon, and 61%of respondent felt that customers were
getting a worse service with Horizon.

When asked if they had other comments on improvements which could be
made to any aspect of the roll out of Horizon, the majority of these
improvements were related to training in some form or other.

7. Conclusions

Results on almost all aspects of Horizon are mixed. Some staff and sub
postmasters getting to grips with the system and are happy and satisfied
whilst others are struggling and continuously having problems. There are no
obvious patterns by office type, IP area, number of counter positions or the
length of time since migration.

However where comparisons have been possible the results are more
favourable than the results from the live trial research last June. Although one
could argue that by their very nature the live trial offices experienced more
problems, so one would expect their results to be lower. However, as a small
group the live trial offices had more support per office. This improvement in
results indicates that lessons have been learnt from the live trial and that the
remedial action taken has improved perception of several aspects of Horizon.
However, the post office should not rest on its laurels and there is still room
for further improvement.

The main message coming through is that they are not getting enough
training. They are mainly happy with what the one and a half days they
received, but the training on balancing is not long enough for their needs.

This has knock on effects in other areas where greater support as they then

problems with the helpdesk would not be such an issue.

The other area for concern is the helpdesks. There is confusion over which
number to call, which is compounded by them being passed back and forth
between helpdesks. There is a problem getting through to the Horizon system
helpdesk in particular and the service from both appears to be lacking in
terms of consistency and level of knowledge.

8. Recommendations and future work

It is strongly recommended that the length of time allocated to balancing in
the training course is extended, since there is anecdotal evidence to suggest
that economising at this stage causes problems further down the line in terms
of the additional support required.

Changes to training have already taken place and there are now preview
events available so staff and sub postmasters can go and see Horizon working
before their training. It will be interesting to see if this has an impact long
term.

The helpdesks are also an area for concern and work is underway to measure
the service provided on a continuous basis. It is recommended that the
staffing levels are reviewed as many staff and sub postmasters are unable to
get through
