Subject: Re: Charge letter - Newcastleton branch
All

{ note Victoria's comments and agree that the whole process of how breaches are dealt with under the new contracts
and whether interviews serve a useful purpose needs to be properly considered. POL's desire to maintain continuity of
service may mean that we should not jump straight to termination in all cases until alternatives have been explored, and
this may involve a meeting with the operator or its representative. However this must be explicitly without prejudice to

POL's contractual rights.

In addition we should clearly delineate any such new process/policy from that which applies under the subpmr contract
- with its right of appeal by subpmr - and this should include not calling this a "charge" letter or any meeting an

“interview” as these imply a quasi-legal process which I think we should avoid.

Paul - is there a meeting on the new process in the offing?
Many thanks
Jessica

Dear Kate
Many thanks for sending this through.

A few points just to flag / mention:

1. You have seen my emails with Rodric and Paul Inwood regarding the interview process, where this comes from

and whether it is necessary. Paul has said that these points will be picked up as part of a review that is
imminent, so for now I have proceeded on the basis that POL wants to allow the opportunity for an interview
to take place. I should point out that here this process seems more unusual than in the case of Daineigh,
because in Daineigh the Operator was an individual (and as such I understand the interview process may be
being used as I understand a similar process was used for subpostmasters) but here the Operator is not an
individual, but a company (Lumsdens Newsagent Ltd). Therefore there is not the same elernent of an
individual being asked to answer a charge against them in a personal capacity. From the contractual (rather
than criminal) point of view here, the company is being asked to answer the charges.

It seems to me that on the basis of the facts in the charge letter, POL has the right to terminate immediately
and therefore again I am not sure of the point of having an interview, particularly as the Operator is a
company. Is there something still to be considered and would the interview in reality ever result in the
Operator not having its agreement terminated? I have added in a sentence towards the end of the letter to
say that POL's rights are reserved, as I would not want it to be said that we had somehow waived our right to
terminate immediately because we allowed the Operator the chance to answer the charges.

. This Agreement is as discussed a little different from the Dalneigh one I reviewed previously. I have assumed
that the standard conditions you initially sent me are the same as the ones referred to in the signed contract
referred to below. If there is any chance that is not correct, please do let me know. However, the name of the
document did include Newcastieton within the description so I assume all is well.

l assume that the Agreement with Lumsdens did commence as agreed and the Consultation Condition
Precedent was met and the other reasons for terminating in Part B do not apply. Please let me know if this is
not the case.

5. In the draft letter it mentions that a transcript and a copy of the interview recording will be provided, but from
speaking to Andy Carpenter in relation to Dalneigh I understand that in fact only a copy of the recording is
provided and no transcript is prepared. I am not sure if there is a different practice in different areas but we
should just be sure that POL does not say it will provide a transcript if only a recording is in fact provided.

6. Iam not sure whether the missing money has been repaid. If not, there are a couple of sections in the letter
which I have included to cover that position. If the money has been repaid, these should be removed.

Do let me know if there is anything I can do to assist further. In particular, do let me know if you would to discuss any
of the changes in more detail.

Kind regards
Victoria

Sabrina,

Could you have a look at this charge letter and advise me of any changes needed please?
This is a branch in Scotland so I'm also keen to make sure it won't set any precedents if there are any differences for
Scottish laws.

Please let me know if any further information is needed.

Anne
