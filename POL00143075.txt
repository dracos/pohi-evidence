       Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to provide an update on the:

       1.1    Progress made in addressing the observations from the 2010/11 IT General
              Controls Audit.
       1.2    Implementation of a SAS70 (ISAE3402) style report.
       1.2    Observations arising from the 2011/12 audit and the proposed Management
              Response.

       Background

       2.1    As part of the annual independent Financial Audit, Ernst & Young undertake
              an audit of the core Post Office systems that support financial transactions,
              namely:
                     • Within the Post Office domain hosted by Fujitsu
                                HNGX (product sales platform)
                            o




                                POLSAP (product and branch accounting and supply chain
                            o




                                / stock management)
                     • Within the Royal Mail domain hosted by CSC
                                SAP HR (human resources)
                            o




                                SAP ESFS (general ledger)
                            o




       2.2    The focus of the IT General Controls audit for each of these systems covers:
                     • Change Management
                               Only appropriately authorised, tested, and approved
                            o




                               changes are made to applications, interfaces, databases,
                               and operating systems.
                     • Logical Access
                               Only authorised persons have access to data and
                            o




                               applications (including programs, tables, and related
                               resources) and that they can perform only specifically
                               authorised functions (e.g., inquire, execute, update).
                     • Operations
                               Data supporting financial information is properly backed up
                            o




                               so such data can be accurately and completely recovered if
                               there is a system outage or data integrity issue.
                               Programs are executed as planned and deviations from
                            o




                               scheduled processing are identified and resolved in a timely
                               manner.
                               IT Operations problems or incidents are identified, resolved,
                            o




                               reviewed, and analysed in a timely manner.

       2.3    The 2010/11 audit resulted in a number of actions for Post Office and Fujitsu
              to address which were concluded by October 2011. The implementation of
                                                                                                POLOO143075
                                                                                              POL00143075



                         Post Office Ltd — Strictly Confidential

           these actions has resulted in significant changes to our processes and to
           deliver improvements to our IT General Controls.

     2.4   Given the timing of this year's audit (January and February 2012), there was
           some time for these changes to have embedded. The improvements are
           evidenced in the findings of the 2011/12 audit where there are no high risk
           observations within the 7 identified (versus 10 last year) and only 25 specific
           recommendations (versus over 70 last year).

     Summary of the 2010111 audit position

     3.1   The 2010/11 audit identified 10 observations (classified as 4 high risk, 3
           medium and 3 low) with over 70 specific recommendations.

     3.2   In response to these observations, Post Office and Fujitsu agreed a series of
           actions (as identified in the Management Comments to the audit report for
           2010/11) to address the areas of risk identified.

     3.3   A Post Office led Audit Steering Group was established to track and manage
           the agreed actions, with all being completed by the end of October 2011, as
           planned.

     3.4   Through an independent Royal Mail Group audit conducted on the Post
           Office systems (November 2011), it was agreed that all actions had been
           completed as planned. Two actions had minor activities still to be completed,
           which were addressed by December 2011. (See Appendix A for a summary
           statement for each of the 2010/11 observations as agreed with the RMG
           audit.)

4.   Update on the SAS70 (ISAE3402) style report implementation

     4.1   One specific recommendation from the 2010/11 audit was to investigate the
           feasibility of having a SAS70 style report produced annually (now known as
           ISAE3402), with a view to establishing greater standardised controls and
           continuously evidenced compliance. Post Office have worked with Fujitsu
           and Ernst & Young to agree an initial way forward where Fujitsu will, at their
           own cost, engage Ernst & Young to produce such a report for the Fujitsu
           hosted Post Office systems within the scope of our annual IT General
           Controls audit.

     4.2   The Fujitsu ISAE3402 report will be introduced for FY2012/13. It will bring
           benefits to both Fujitsu and Post Office. Whilst initially Fujitsu will still require
           the same level of effort to support the ISAE3402 audit, over time the scope
           of that audit will be expanded to cover other standards (e.g. IS027001, PCI,
           LiNK). This results in economies for Fujitsu as only one audit is required for
           all those controls that are common across all standards. As the adoption of
           the annual ISAE3402 report embeds, the good practice of continuous
           evidencing of compliance will also deliver efficiencies, with each subsequent
           annual audit having more immediate access to evidence of control.

     4.3   Post Office will also benefit with the introduction of Fujitsu's ISAE3402 report.
           With the initial scope covering the controls within the annual IT General
           Controls audit, our auditors will be able to draw on the ISAE3402 report as a
           trusted source of evidence. Where control is evidenced in that report,
           reduced investigation will be required by our auditors, with resulting
           efficiencies.

                                                                                           POL00143075



                         Post Office Ltd — Strictly Confidential

     4.4   In addition, Post Office IT & Change and Information Security functions are
           jointly aiming to adopt ISAE3402 good practices to establish a single audit
           framework to manage how Post Office maintains compliance with the
           controls across all required standards. This single audit framework will not
           only drive efficiencies for Post Office, similar to the benefits identified above,
           it will also drive improvements in the adoption of our policies and processes
           through the requirement for continuous evidencing of compliance.

5.   Update on the 2011/12 audit

     5.1   Building on lessons learned from the 2010/11 audit, a more rigorous
           management control approach was adopted for the 2011/12 audit. This
           involved clear planning and communication to all parties well in advance of
           required involvement. As a result the 2011/12 audit operated with a high
           degree of cooperation across all parties and delivered on time. This is in
           contrast to 2010/11 that required substantial senior management intervention
           and delivered 3 months later than planned.

     5.2   The 2011/12 audit found a demonstrable improvement from the 2010/11
           audit across all previous observations and no high risk observations were
           identified.

     5.3   A total of 7 observations have been identified this year with only 25 specific
           recommendations. Each of these observations built on the findings of the
           2010/11 audit with Ernst & Young recommending further areas for
           improvement or repeated recommendations where similar weaknesses
           persist.

     5.4   The proposed 2011/12 Management Response identifies how the agreed
           actions from last year's audit sought to address any repeated weaknesses. In
           addition, the responses identify where repeated weaknesses persist due to
           legacy constraints, with policy and process being used to mitigate any
           potential risks.

     5.5   This year's responses also identify what further immediate actions will be
           taken, e.g. re-iteration and communication of policy. In addition, new reviews
           of policy and process are to take place to identify appropriate further
           improvements.

     5.6   A summary of this year's Ernst & Young recommendations and related
           responses can be found in Appendix B.

     5.7   Post Office Audit Steering Group will track and manage the progress of these
           actions and report to the Post Office Audit Committee to agree each course
           of action proposed, timeframes required and evidence completion of agreed
           actions.

                                    deterrence is not as strong as prevention but in this case the operational impact of devolving SAP_ALL
                                    privileges is believed to carry more risk of operational instability. Consequently, Post Office's attention
