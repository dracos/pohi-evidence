Can you validate what is written below, before I send it onto stakeholders in POL. Basically POL are trying to confirm
whether Fujitsu have made any data changes over the last 3 years that could invalidate the integrity of Horizon. I don’t
believe you have, and I am trying to explain below how we can confirm this to be the case.

Simon

I do not believe we have changed any physical data relating the Branch Database, or any other key database since the
introduction of HNGx (Horizon Online). I am still getting Fujitsu to check and validate this though.

In terms of controls, the Fujitsu Event Management System, monitors the infrastructure such as the Branch database, an
alert would be raised should someone try to change the data, this would flag up to the Fujitsu Service Management
Centre team, who would raise an incident to investigate. Should it prove to be a security incident, Fujitsu would notify
POL by my team and we would follow a security incident process.

If there was an issue, such as we experienced in November 2011, where an item expired on the system causing a
discrepancy. In that instance a key sequence caused a value not to be associated with a relevant cash line. This in turn
caused a “Receipts/Payments” mismatch alert. If this would happen the Fujitsu SMC would not only notify the Fujitsu
technical teams, Post Office would be engaged and we would follow the major incident process, due to the potential
implications. For clarity, during this incident Horizon didn’t lose data, the script, didn’t assign the value to any accounting
line, so it was sat in limbo, Fujitsu could have manually reassigned the value to the appropriate cash account line, but it
was agreed we would accept the loss/discrepancy and fix forward the code to stop it reoccurring. Fujitsu were able to

POL00141531

map through the transaction and identify which branches/accounts were affected, so the amount never “disappeared” it
just failed to be reconciled correctly.

iknow you are still working on this. As I am out next week, can you keep Lesley in the loop as you get a clear picture on
the processes we use to approve changes to live data, and a list of the times this has happened.

Also, Lesley is in Dearne and Chesterfield on Thursday, if you are there she would appreciate a quick conversation with
you on this subject.

Thanks, Simon

Fujitsu tell me that very very occasionally the support team are required to make updates directly to the branch
database. (presumably to fix support problems)

And that when such a change is required, it is signed off by POL using the Service Desk.
Are you aware of this process? And if so, how do I get a log of all such requests.
Thanks, Simon
