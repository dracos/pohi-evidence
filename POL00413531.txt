Lisa,
These are the reports that Alice is waiting for.

The Horizon Breifing has 2 embeded reports (at the end of the document) which are the Garner Reports. Can
you let Alice know that these contain quite a lot of technical detail.

The Horizon Integrity Report was put together for our previous MD, Dave Smith in 2010. Whilst this
information is quite old it is still relevant.
Any questions, let me know.
