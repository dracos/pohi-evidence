Hi Andy

Ihave read the Defence all the way through ona stand alone basis (not yet side by side against the GPOC!) and have no
comments. I’m convinced ~ but I guess it’s not my judgement that counts!!!

You and Mark were locked away when I came back to my desk. Mark said that you thought the discussion had gone
well, although I was kicking myself for talking about the black hat’ work, as that took us down an unnecessary rabbit
hole. Still we got it back .....

So, in terms of minutes of the discussion yesterday, my suggestion ~ subject to your thoughts, would be:

“SM and Andrew Parsons, Partner from Bond Dickinson briefed GE on the proposed Defence that would be filed on
behalf of Post Office on 18 July in the Postmaster litigation. The following points were made:

@ Mr Parsons described the role of the Defence document in the proceedings, and noted that the document
would be signed by the General Counsel on behaif of Post Office.

@ The accuracy of the factual statements included in the Defence had been reviewed internally by those Post
Office staff with knowledge of the relevant facts.

e« Mr Parsons summarised the key themes arising in the litigation and the approach to those themes in the
defence.

e freeths were still advertising for additional claimants however the window for applicants to apply to join the
litigation would close on 26 July and Post Office would receive details of the total number and names of
applicants shortly thereafter. Present indications suggested that the total number of claimants in the
proceedings would be 400-500.

* The Claimants have the opportunity to respond to Post Office's Defence in a formal document called a
Reply. This is due to be served on Post Office and filed with the Court on 20 September 2017. {tis not
mandatory for the Claimants to serve a Reply but given the complexity and importance of this case it is expected
that they would do so.

« ACourt hearing, called a Case Management Conference, will take place on 19 October 2017. This hearing, and
the preparation for it, will provide an opportunity for Post Office and the Claimants to agree further steps
leading up to trial, including the selection of those postmasters' cases which the parties wish to put forward as
Lead Cases; disclosure of documents; witness evidence and expert evidence. Once selected, the Lead Cases will
be examined in greater detail by the Court at mini-trials with the aim of using those cases to determine points of
principle or fact that apply broadly to many cases. To be able to do this, the parties will need to set out their
positions in relation to these Lead Cases in further, case-specific Particulars of Claim, Defences and Replies.

GE noted the briefing and requested that a further update be provided to GE and the Board following the Case
Management Conference. This update should include an assessment of the potential impact on Post Office and its
business and operations of the range of possible outcomes, based on the issues to be considered through the Lead
Cases.”

Many thanks,

Jane

All

Please find attached the draft Defence for your review and comment. As discussed earlier, if possible please provide
comments rather than amendments to the actual text. I've also attached the Claimants’ Generic Particulars of Claim for
reference.

You'll see a few paints where input from Deloitte and Fujitsu is needed ~ we expect to get this today.

Please send any comments to me and Amy Prime (copied).

Thanks
Andy
