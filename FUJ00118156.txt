1 Introduction

This Release Note is provided as a definition of the CSR Increment 2.2.

The principal functionality of the Core System Release (CSR) is provided by
CSR Live Trial 2 which has been implemented at the existing live Post Offices
and is being implemented via the National Rollout programme.

CSR Increment 2.2 is an enhancement release that will be applied to the
existing estate and to newly rolled out Post Offices upon re-commencement
of rollout in the New Year.

The prime purpose of this upgrade is to enhance the reconciliation facilities
for transactions performed at the Post Office counter and the accumulation
figures sent to TIP.

2 Scope

This document defines the extent of the software changes to CSR, the
platforms affected and the outline upgrade actions.

3 Release Content

The release content of CSR is defined in ICL Pathway Core System Release
Contents Description (PA/STR/012).

This enhancement release includes the following approved Change
Proposals:

CP_2186 — Additional EPOSS Reconciliation controls
CP_2254 - Removal of BES Reconciliation At CSR

The release content is supplemented by the customer acceptance incident
Al_376 that relates directly to the above Change Proposals.

« Enhancements overview

The accounting transaction data recorded by the EPOSS system on the
OPS can be reconciled with the accounting transaction data returned to
the POCL TIP system across the TIP interface.

The accounting transaction data written each day at the OPS can be
reconciled with the Cash Account data written at the OPS when the Cash
Account is produced.
The Outlet Stock Holdings generated at the end of a Cash Account Period
at the OPS can be reconciled with the Outlet Stock Holdings transferred to
TIP across the TIP Interface
