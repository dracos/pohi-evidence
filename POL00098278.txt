Fine, thanks. I am now unexpectedly freer this afternoon.
So if someone let's me know when you are able to talk I'll try and fit round that.

Hi Alice, lovely day!

Just to let you know I haven't forgotten Vanquis - I have an approach, which I've sent to Nick and Chris.
I should get back to you shortly.

Also re James Arbuthnot - I have asked for an update on our workplan by the end of this week, to make
sure we are in track. (JA is away in committee business, so we are meeting post-whitsun recess.)

One other issue arose overnight, which I may need to brief you on over the next couple of days, so will
try to get a phone slot.

Bw, Paula
