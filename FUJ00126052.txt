David

Following Tuesday's review, I have consolidated and updated the issues list to reflect agreed positions and the status (as
of today) of the remaining issues.

If my understanding is correct, the following 12 issues remain outstanding and we need to focus our attentions on closing
them down in sufficient time to allow the CD to be updated and ready for issue on Weds 3rd March:

Outstanding Issues: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.8, 2.4, 2.6, 3.1, 3.4, 3.5, 3.7, 3.13
Please advise if I have missed anything out or incorrectly described the issue/status/agreed outcome.
Regards
