2.3.1.1. SLTs detailed in sections 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 of this Data Centre Operations Service, Service
Description, which do not specify a measurement period are:

*® — reported monthly via the SRB; and

* measured over a Service Level Measurement Period equating to a Post Office financial

2.3.1.2 SLTs detailed in sections 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 of this Data Centre Operations Service, Service
Description, which specify the “SLT Calendar Year” as the measurement periods are:

(a) reported monthly via the SRB; and

2.3.2 Service Level Relief

Section 2.4: of this Data Centre Operations Service, Service Description sets out the limits
which, if exceeded over a monthly period, will entitle Fujitsu Services to adjust the
measurement of performance in respect of the Data Centre Operations Service SLTs, and
Liquidated Damages Targets (LDTs) if applicable and affected by this excess. Such
adjustments shall be made on the following basis:

1. Fujitsu Services shall identify, for joint consideration with Post Office, any failure to achieve the
Data Centre Operations Service SLTs and / or LDTs within the month due to the limits being
exceeded. Post Office and Fujitsu Services (acting reasonably) will agree the reasons for that
SLT or LDT failure if it has been caused or contributed to by Fujitsu Services:

(a) if the SLT or LDT failure occurs as a result of a Default by Fujitsu Services, no adjustment
shall be made to the performance measurements for the affected SLTs or LDTs in respect
of that month;

(b) if the SLT or LDT failure is agreed to be as a result of the limits being exceeded, the
performance measurements for the affected SLTs and LDTs in respect of that month shall
be reported as reasonably required by the Parties;

2. Following each Service Level Measurement Period, Post Office and Fujitsu Services will
assess whether, on average during the relevant Service Level Measurement Period, any of the
limits have been exceeded by 10% (ten per cent) or more. In making that assessment, Post
Office and Fujitsu Services shall consider the cause of any daily peaks in excess of the daily
averages during the relevant Service Level Measurement Period and disregard the
measurements in respect of those days where the peaks have arisen as a result of a Fujitsu
Services Default. If, having made this assessment, Post Office and Fujitsu Services agree that
a limit has been exceeded by 10% (ten per cent) and within any three (3) consecutive months,
Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall meet to discuss, (acting reasonably) any appropriate
changes to the applicable Data Centre Operations Service SLTs and LDTs; and

3. Any dispute between Post Office and Fujitsu Services arising in connection with the application
of this section 2.3.2 of this Data Centre Operations Service, Service Description shall be
resolved in accordance with the Dispute Resolution Procedure.

2.3.4.6 Transaction Times: Banking Functions Transactions

2.3.4.6.1 For the purposes of Banking Functions Transactions, the SLT defined in Table 6 below, are
the result of the following calculation:

(a) for each Banking Functions Transaction, Fujitsu Services shall record the time “T1” as the
time elapsed between the request being generated at the relevant Counter Position and the
corresponding authorisation being received back at that Counter Position;

(b) for each Banking Functions Transaction, Fujitsu Services shall record the time “T2” which
elapses between the time the request leaves the Fujitsu Services domain for routing into the
Banks' domain and the corresponding authorisation being received back into the Fujitsu
Services' domain from the Banks; and

(c) Fujitsu Services shall calculate a value “T” for each Banking Functions Transaction, as

follows:
T=T1-72
In addition:

Maximum Counter Wait Period (MCWP) minus Maximum Authorisation Agent Wait Period
(MAAWP), referred to as “Additional Time”, shall not be less than 15 seconds.

. Any changes to the MCWP and / or MAAWP as referred to in section 2.3.4.6.2 below, where
the “Additional Time” is more than or equal to 15 seconds shall be subject to change as
defined in the CCD entitled "Fujitsu Services/Post Office Interface Agreement for
Operational Business Change — Product" (CS/PRD/058) and changes where the MCWP is
greater than 40 seconds and / or the resulting “Additional Time” is less than 15 seconds
shall be subject to agreement under the Change Control Procedure.

. Banking Functions Transactions shall be those for which a request is generated and a
corresponding authorisation is received from the Banks before the earliest of the following
events:

o the MCWP has expired;
co the Banking Functions Transaction is declined by the Clerk; and
othe Banking Functions Transaction fails, and

(a) I No other Banking Functions Transaction shall be included in the calculation set out in Table

6 below.

2.3.4.6.2 NB Request, NB Authorisation and NB Confirmation Action

Fujitsu Services shall ensure that:

Following successful NB Token Validation, a Banking Function Transaction shall not
proceed unless a network connection to the Data Centre can be reasonably expected to be
established to obtain on-line NB Authorisation. Once that connection has been established,
a NB Request shall be sent to the Banks and the Banking Function Transaction shall only
proceed if a positive NB Authorisation is received from the Banks and that Banking Function
Transaction is not Declined by the Counter Clerk. In the event that the Counter Clerk
Declines a Financial Transaction, a CO Confirmation shall be sent on-line to the Banks.

e There shall be no local facility within a Branch to override a NB Decline response in an NB
Authorisation.

e — If the NB Authorisation is not for the same amount as the NB Request, the Banking Function
Transaction will be Declined by the NB System, except in the case of a NB Request for a
Banking Function Transaction type "Withdraw Limit", which will be permitted to proceed
subject to the maximum limit set by Reference Data.

¢ The MAAWP and the MCWP shall be:
1. Set as parameters in the NB System;
2. Common for all Banks; and

3. Configurable by Fujitsu Services' Reference Data,
And in any event, the MCWP shall not exceed 40 seconds.

If, after the generation of a NB Request at a Counter Position or after the Authorisation
Agent makes a NB Request available to the Banks, a corresponding NB Authorisation is not
received within the MCP or MAAWP respectively, the Banking Function Transaction shall
be declined.
