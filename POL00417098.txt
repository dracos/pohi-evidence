As we discussed briefly on Monday evening, there has been recent interest from MPs in
purported cases where the Horizon system has left sub postmasters out of pocket. We

have to date said that this is an operational matter for POL and resisted calls to impose

areview of Horizon etc. We are in theory happy to continue holding this line - but if we

do so and it turns out that there have been problems with Horizon, then there will be

.. significant political heat. Grateful therefore if you could let me know how confident POL
is that there is nothing behind these claims.

thanks

Oliver

The Rt Hon Keith Simpson,
House of Commons,
London

SW1A 0AA

June 4" 2010.
Dear Mr Simpson,

First of all, may I congratulate you on your recent success in the General
Election.

On 3 March I wrote to you on behalf of my daughter and her treatment along
with others at the hands of the Post Office.

I realise your help and support in this matter will have been delayed due to the
Election and that is quite understandable. However, I now approach you again
as this is a problem that will not go away. _
We now have a copy of a recent letter sent to Alan Bates
Edward Davey MP, new Minister for postal affairs (BIS) in’
Mr Davey is neither interested nor helpful.

Whilst he prefers to distance himself behind such a reply, I respectfully
suggest that all the Ministers in Government are there to represent us and
best help us. Therefore it is to be hoped that matters will be taken up on our
behalf.

As the Government holds 100% shares in the Post Office, this means we the
public own them so the validity of Mr Davey’s reply is questionable. Therefore,
I would hope you could speak to Mr Davey or his department to ask him to
look at this issue again.

It may well be that you would prefer to communicate with my daughter directly
so her address is as follows:

by
Clearly

‘Mrs Slobhan Saver.

Thank you for your help.
Yours sincerely,

Sra.

Thank you for your letter of 20 May, requesting a meeting to discuss the Post
Office Horizon system. . .

Since 2001, when the Royal Mail (which includes Post Office Ltd (POL)) was
set up as a public limited company with the Government as its only shareholder,
Government has adopted an arm's length relationship with the company so that
it has the commercial freedom to run its business operations without
interference from the shareholder.

The integrity of the Post Office Horizon system is an operational and contractual
matter for POL and not Government, whilst I do appreciate your concerns and
those of the Alliance members, I do not believe a meeting would serve any
useful purpose.

The Horizon system is an operational responsibility of the company and I have had no
such discussions. It is an established convention that Minsters of one Administration
cannot see the documents of a previous Administration. I am therefore unable to provide

the information requested.

Dear I
POST OFFICE HORIZON ACCOUNTING PROBLEMS

As a former consultant in the postal services sector, I am sure you are only too well aware of
the accounting problems that have arisen from the Post Office Horizon computer system
which have resulted in postmasters and mistresses suffering financial losses and sometimes
even incurring criminal prosecutions because of unexplained discrepancies that have led to
financial shortfalls.

A former sub-postmistress living in my constituency experienced unaccountable shortages
amounting to a total of £36,000. She reported these to her line-manager and, following an
investigation, she was suspended and faced criminal charges of false accounting and was
ordered to pay £48,000, which was reduced to £35,000 and then further reduced to £25,000.

In March 2009, she received a “without prejudice” letter from Bond Pearce, a Limited
Liability Partnership. “For the sake of commercial expediency”, their client, the PO, offered
not to pursue her for the civil claim or pursue a criminal prosecution provided she did not
bring any claim against PO Ltd and that each party be: bear their own costs.

Towards the end of 2009, a number of falsely accused postmasters formed the Justice for
Sub-postmasters Alliance, with the common goal of publicising what they see as serious
flaws in the PO’s Horizon accounting system and I understand that it has already been the
subject of media interest in the form of an S4C documentary and victims are pressing for a
House of Commons debate on the issue. 1

Tam aware that the previous government built up an extremely poor IT record-and that it had
already entered into a contract with the Bank of Ireland to enable the PO to provide a range
of financial services subject to a 50/50 share of any profits from the joint banking venture, I
also understand that the last government also pledged to plough another £180m into the
network in the dying days of its administration, which may have implications for the
coalition government.
