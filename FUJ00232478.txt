The intent of this Interface Agreement is to establish effective co-operation between
ICL Pathway and PON for the timely efficient and cost effective delivery of
Operational Business Change — Product using Reference Data to Horizon enabled
post office counters.

[DN Aspects of this agreement are also relevant to Outlet Reference Data, e.g.
those sections which cover errors and rework.]

This Agreement identifies:

e PON’s and ICL Pathway’s requirement for Product changes introduced via
Reference Data,

e the agreed end-to-end service solution for ICL Pathway and PON, both
separately and jointly, for implementing such changes and

e the obligations of both parties, both separately and jointly, that must be met in
order to deliver the solution.

There are a number of documents (which are not CCDs) that describe the
interfaces and agreements made between ICL Pathway and PON for the
management of Operational Business Changes. This document provides an
“umbrella” agreement for those others and they will comply with the Agreements
made within this Interface Agreement.

Whilst this Agreement serves as an umbrella for other documentation it cannot
supersede any contractual obligations defined within the Contract schedules. The
timescales shown later in this document are those which are agreed by both parties
to be operationally viable and as such form the basis of normal business practice
when implementing changes to Reference Data.

2.2 Maintenance of this Agreement
This Agreement is applicable to the CSR+ Horizon release. It will be reviewed for

any future major software release and on an on-going basis. It is maintained by ICL
Pathway on behalf of both parties.

2.3 Future Developments

PON and ICL Pathway agree to work jointly to improve the quality and effectiveness
of the Reference Data interface as follows:

e Review the functionality, scope and effectiveness of the Reference Data test
environment and enhance where appropriate.

e Continuously monitor the toolset available in the test environment, in particular
the Reference Data comparison tool for identifying impact of planned Reference
Data changes with the possibility of enhancement where appropriate.

e Continuously monitor and where necessary improve the Reference Data Change
Catalogue (RDCC) relating to Reference Data requirements.

e Review the consolidated set of Business Rules and procedures which have been
jointly developed and implemented.

e Continuously improve the scope and effectiveness of Business and System tests.

The programme for delivery of each of the above will be overseen by the RDORF.
2.4 Service Management Policy
Service Management Policy is described in [ref 16]

2.5 Alerting when data is at risk of late delivery

When it is known that Reference Data may be at risk of non delivery by the time it is
required at outlets an Alert may be required. The detail of the Alert Process is
described in [ref 18].

The principles of the Alert Process with respect to data being delivered overnight to
become active at outlets the following day are:

« to provide warning to relevant parties in PON and ICL Pathway, that there
is risk of critical reference data not being available at outlets the following
day

e to allow appropriate contingency to be invoked against that risk where lack
of the data would cause critical problems

The process may similarly be invoked if the final milestone is know to be at risk (see
section 9.3)

The process is initially invoked by PON setting the Alert Flag on the Release
Authorisation Form. If the Release Day is the day prior to the Start Date, and the
Alert Flag is set, RDT will initiate the warning process.

3 Scope

3.1 Interfaces

This Agreement covers all the interfaces between ICL Pathway and PON that
support the Operational Business Change process for pre-defined product changes
for release CSR+ of the Horizon system.

Interface Interface Interface
I PON Pathway Pathway PON Pathway
process process process I process * I process
* this step is not

needed if change is
pre-authorised

The start is the point where an OBC form has been completed and issued within
PON, and the end point is where the Reference Data has been released within ICL
Pathway for delivery to the live counters.

The delivery of the Reference Data to counters, following release authorisation, is
covered by the SLA [see section3.3].

It applies to both Advanced and Basic Product Changes where:

e a Basic Change is a change which consists solely of Reference Data which
requires no additional ICL Pathway actions and may be submitted to ICL
Pathway without notice

« an Advanced Change is a change which requires additional ICL Pathway activity
and is subject to advanced notification.

3.2 Outlet Changes

This Interface Agreement does not cover Reference Data for Outlet Change [see ref.
11].

[DN: Refer to statement in section 2.1]
3.3 SLA

The contractual provisions relating to the distribution of Reference Data are defined
in the SLA in Schedule G10 of the contract.

3.4 Operational Business Change processes

The Operational Business Change (OBC) process for product change is defined in
[ref. 1] and the types of change that qualify for the OBC process are defined in the
Reference Data Change Catalogue (RDCC) [ref. 2]. Changes not found in the
RDCC must be requested via the normal Change Control mechanism (CR/CCN).

A summary of the process is given below.

Note:

Not every Change Type follows every step of the process [see section 5].
The timescales for each stage of the process are defined in [section 5].
The types of change that the process applies to are defined in [section 4].
The responsibilities of each party are defined in [section 8].

4 Types of Change

4.1 Introduction

Change types are pre-defined for inclusion into the OBC — product process. This
definition can be found in the Reference Data Change Catalogue (RDCC) [ref. 2].
Each pre-defined change type is grouped as shown in the table in section 1.

The RDCC Product Change categories that apply to these changes are listed in
sections 4.2 and 4.5 below. The assumptions listed in the RDCC must be adhered
to, in order to apply these categorisations.

4.2 Standard Changes

The order of the change types in this section is significant and is an indication of the
level of risk with each type and therefore the amount of checking that is deemed to
be necessary. The change types are in order of increasing risk from those which
need little or no checking, as the effect of an error would be minimal on the Live
estate, to those which need extensive checking, as the effect of an error may be
significant on the Live estate. Those changes, which are deemed to require minimal
or no checking, are classified as Basic - Pure. Those changes, which are deemed
to require most checking, are classified as Advanced - Complex.

A complete list of changes applicable to each type is held within the RDCC. Should
PON decide that additional checking is required, a change may be submitted in a
type with a higher risk position in this section. However the converse is not true, in
that a change can never be requested with a lower risk position than the type shown
in the RDCC.

Appendix B: Standard Changes - Details, shows a representative list of the changes
for each type.

4.2.1 Basic - Pure

Basic Changes do not require advanced notification from PON to ICL Pathway (OBC
form). The delivery of the Reference Data file using agreed mechanisms [see
section 0.3] is the request for change. The file must identify that its contents are
Basic Pure changes. The file may contain more than one change of the same type.
All Basic files contain only Class 1 Reference Data items. ICL Pathway checks the
contents of the file are appropriate for the type of change. Pure changes do not
require verification and are pre-authorised for release.

4.2.2 Basic — High Risk

Basic Changes do not require advanced notification from PON to ICL Pathway (OBC
form). The delivery of the Reference Data file using agreed mechanisms [see
section 0.3] is the request for change. The file must identify that its contents are a
Basic High Risk change. The file may contain more than one change of the same

type. All Basic files contain only Class 1 Reference Data items. ICL Pathway checks
the contents of the file are appropriate for the type of change. High Risk changes
require a Verification and a Comparison report and authorisation by PON before
release.

4.2.3 Advanced Simple

Advanced Simple changes require advanced notification from PON to ICL Pathway
(an OBC form) to request the change. Associated Reference Data files must be
identifiable as such through the BCR number. ICL Pathway checks the contents of
the file are appropriate for this type of change. ICL Pathway has actions to take to
implement the change (in addition to processing the Type A Reference Data file
from PON) e.g. update documentation, but these actions can occur after the change
has been released and therefore do not extend the lead-time for the change. These
changes require a Verification and a Comparison report and authorisation by PON
before release.

4.2.4 Advanced Standard

Advanced Standard changes require advanced notification from PON to ICL
Pathway (an OBC form) to request the change. Associated Reference Data files
must be identifiable as such through the BCR number. ICL Pathway checks the
contents of the file are appropriate for this type of change. ICL Pathway has actions
to take to implement the change (in addition to processing the Type A Reference
Data file from PON) e.g. process Type B files, and these actions must occur before
the change has been released, therefore the lead-times are longer than for Simple
or Basic changes. These changes require a Verification and a Comparison report
and authorisation by PON before release.

4.2.5 Advanced Complex

Advanced Complex changes require advanced notification from PON to ICL
Pathway (an OBC form) to request the change. Associated Reference Data files
must be identifiable as such through the BCR number. ICL Pathway checks the
contents of the file are appropriate for this type of change. ICL Pathway must
generate Type C Reference Data to implement the change and test that the change
works as requested in the OBC form. These changes require a Verification and a
Comparison report and authorisation by PON before release.

4.3 AP

AP changes are similar to Advanced Complex changes and require notification from
PON to ICL Pathway (an OBC form) to request the change. Associated Reference
Data files must be identifiable as such through the BCR number. ICL Pathway
checks the contents of the file are appropriate for this type of change. ICL Pathway
has actions to take to implement the change e.g. test Tokens and supply test files to
HAPS (or the appropriate PON Client) for PON End to End testing of changes.
These changes require a Verification and a Comparison report, additional testing
and authorisation by PON before release.

(as described in AP CTO & Token Verification documents)

Introduce new AP client, service or token
Change client name (new token data)
Cease AP Client, product or token
Introduce new Smart Card

Notes on AP change:

e Changing AP product details when an end-to-end test file is not required falls
outside the category of AP change and is to be treated in the same way as any
other product change.

e Ceasing AP Client, product or token when the service is Live, i.e. it is not being
withdrawn from a current CTO cycle, is to be be implemented as an Advanced
Simple change, with the client service list being amended after the event.

4.4 ICON Change

Changes to ICONs are processed in a similar way to other OBC changes however,
in most cases ICONs are produced in batches rather than individually. Leadtimes
are currently under discussion. Full details of the process for ICON changes are
described in [ref 20]

4.5 Fast-track changes

4.5.1 Basic Express

A Basic Express change is a subset of Basic High Risk changes and must comply
with the definitions in [section 4.2.1]. However, the lead-times [see section 5]
specified for a Basic Express change can only be achieved where verification can
be performed on the basis of the Verification Report and not a Comparison Report.
The type of change must be such that there is minimal risk of error occurring
elsewhere within the system as a result of applying the change and is therefore
limited to:

Change price of non-value stock
Change price of revaluable value stock *
Change min/max quantity/value

Change Long/ Medium / Short name

The limits for use are:

only for the categories of change which conform to the above e.g. ‘Ticket
and Travel’ products or to meet the requirement for Tight Timescales

only OBCs that must be active on completion of the change within 48hrs
OBCs must be received by BSM/OSG by 10am on a working weekday and
only normal volumes of change as defined in [section 6]

the Change Number must start with defined prefixes [ref. 15]. If a Change
is delivered to ICL Pathway with this prefix but the contents do not meet

the specified criteria it will be processed according to the normal lead-
times. ICL Pathway will inform PON using the incident process.
* Note: When a Basic High Risk change is to change the price of revaluable value
stock, Horizon counters will prompt counter staff on each of the three calendar
days prior to when revaluation will need to be performed, provided that the
Reference Data is already at the counter. Should a similar change be put
through the Basic Express mechanism, this prompting period may be for less
than three calendar days. It is PON’s responsibility to provide any additional
notification required to users.
x Where the change is as described above, the requirement for completion within
48hrs may be extended, if required, to allow for this 3 calendar day period.

4.5.2 Migration Special

A Migration Special change is a specific subset of Basic Pure changes and must
comply with the definitions in [section 4.2.1]. Migration Specials are pre-
authorised for release and no verification is required.

Migration Special changes are additions only to the Reference Data defining
which non-core products a particular outlet can sell, normally where the outlet
has been selling the item but the Reference Data does not reflect this. This
Reference Data is needed so that the Cash Account can record those sales,
when it is migrated to the Horizon system.

The limits for use are:

additions to Non-core Product to Outlet mappings only

Reference Data must be received by Pathway by 10am for release to be
actioned on the day of receipt or a phone call is required requesting a
later file to be released

© Reference Data files must be identifiable as Migration Specials

Migration Specials differ from the standard Basic Pure change for adding non-
core associations to an outlet by virtue of:

the urgency with which the data needs to be delivered to the outlet.
Migration Specials refer to one outlet or one product — the normal Basic
Pure change may have any combination of products and outlets.

Where possible PON should use the Basic Pure change for addition of non-core
association records.

Once ICL Pathway has confirmed that the Reference Data is of the required type
it will be released to the ‘Live’ environment.

4.5.3 Tight Timescales

4.5.3.1 Requirement

Requirement 539/3 states there is a need to “implement changes to Reference Data
to tight timescales. As an example of such timescales, it shall be possible to
implement Reference Data changes consequent on a [Treasury] Budget by start of
business on the following day”.

4.5.3.2 Definition

A Tight Timescale change is caused by either:

® an emergency situation where normal lead-times cannot be adhered to because
of legal circumstances outside of PON control, or

e to allow PON to exploit commercial opportunities.

Each instance of such change must be notified in writing by PON to ICL Pathway
and agreed between PON Head of Business Service Management and ICL Pathway
Customer Service Director or their nominated authorised deputies.

4.5.3.3 Types

Analysis by PON of the business requirements indicates that the types of change
that require to be actioned in Tight Timescales are:

e Price changes

e Emergency cessation of a product

e Product introduction or change where the product has been created in advance
with interim details.

a) Price Change

The most frequent Tight Timescale changes are price changes. These may be
processed via the fast-track Basic Express route.

b) Emergency cessation

From the CSR+ version of Horizon the ability to transact a product is controlled by
the use of Item Transaction Modes and therefore these type of changes may be
processed via the fast-track Basic Express route.

c) Product introduction or change (with interim details)

A new product (or product change) can be introduced in advance of all details being

available e.g. to meet a late-breaking business opportunity. Mandatory details

should be provided initially, although some will have interim values

e.g.

« product name may be set to “test name” or other identifiably interim name.

e the cash account mapping may be to a line marked as “temporary” .

e the button for the product may not be introduced until a later date, with the
product only available to be sold by PLU initially.

ICL Pathway ICL Pathway / PON Interface Agreement for Ref: CS/PRD/058
Operational Business Change - Product
Version: 6.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 13/072001

The “interim” product should be verified using standard processes for product
change [see sections 3.4 and 5.6].

To set up the interim product the normal lead-times should be adhered to. When the

interim product cannot be set up with the normal lead-times, it will be dealt with as a

high priority exception [see section 9.2].

The interim details will be later replaced using:

e a Basic Express change for the final information relating to price and name. This
must be identifiable as part of the Tight Timescale change, and will be verified
via the Verification Report for Basic Express, before the change is released

e standard changes that occur after the go live of the product e.g. the introduction
of the button, or the change of the Cash Account mapping.

4.5.3.4 Limitations when information is available at a very late stage

Whilst acknowledging that PON may not have control over legal or governmental
changes it must be recognised that the ability of the end to end process to produce,
check, authorise and release Reference Data takes a finite time and therefore it may
not be possible in all circumstances to meet the requirements. To this end the
following are guidelines to the limitations for Tight Timescales changes where the
information is only made available at a very late stage (e.g. 4 p.m. on a budget day).

« The time to key the data into the RDS system, extract and transmit to ICL
Pathway must be considered (probably a minimum of 1 hour)

« The time that RDMC takes to process the incoming data must be considered
(approximately 30 minutes)

e If counter checks at OSG are required an absolute minimum of 2 hours is
required for RDT system processing. It is therefore likely that this time will

FUJ00232478

FUJ00232478

ICL Pathway ICL Pathway / PON Interface Agreement for Ref: CS/PRD/058
Operational Business Change - Product
Version: 6.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 13/072001

not be available and therefore checking of the data can only be by review of
reports — minimum of 30 minutes to produce and transmit to OSG

e The time that OSG will take to validate reports, or view data on counters
should time be available for extract, needs to be considered (estimated as a
minimum of 30 minutes)

e In order to meet normal operational schedules, authorisation to release a
Tight Timescales change should be received by ICL Pathway by 7:30 p.m.

e The introduction of new items is impossible overnight. If there is a possibility
that new items will be needed their skeleton data must be set up in advance,
as described above in section 4.5.3.3.c

e Changes to Menu Hierarchy can only be achieved within Tight Timescales
when sufficient time is available — under normal circumstances, where the
normal leadtime is not available, a Business Critical Advanced Change may
be appropriate

e An overnight change should therefore only be of the type which amends the
price or name of items

On the basis of the above timings, the latest time for commencement for an
overnight Tight Timescales change, such as Budget annoucements, to be with
RDOT for keying is 5 p.m. for a change to be checked by report and 3 p.m. for a
change to be checked by counter. Whilst these timings are theoretically possible
any error which occurs in data preparation or is discovered during checking may
affect the ability of all parties to complete the exercise. Therefore, wherever
possible more time should be given.

4.5.4 Live Fix

The time scale for incident correction is driven by the impact of the incident, the
complexity of the solution and the Start Date (or Agreed Date) for the change to be
live at the outlets. (see section 9.3)

4.5.5 Business Critical Advanced Change

It has been recognised that the ICL Pathway and PON operational units have the
ability, in some circumstances, to shorten the OBC lead time without adversely
impacting the success of the change, or any other change in the system.

A Business Critical Advanced Change category has been introduced to permit
operational units to decide, where possible, to deliver change within a shorter time
than the specified leadtime. _BCAC does not replace Tight Timescales but rather
offers an alternative, operational, method (similar to Basic Express) of progressing
Advanced changes.

= Each instance of a Business Critical Advanced Change must be agreed by each
the groups involved in the processing of the change (normally BSM/OSG, RDOT
and RDT) before the change is submitted to ICL Pathway for action. This must
include agreement on the effective date for the Reference Data

= The leadtime requirement for such a change must be shorter than that which
would normally be required to complete the change

= The agreed leadtime requirement must be achievable

= Any errors or modifications which occur in the delivery of such a change are
likely to cause failure to achieve the agreed leadtime

= Only minimal changes to the Menu Hierarchy are possible within shortened

should be considered via the PLU in the first instance with buttons to follow

changes in any rolling 4 week period

5 Lead-time for changes

5.1 Introduction

The lead-times quoted in this section are the end-to-end times covering both PON
and ICL Pathway activities. Each party must meet each milestone applicable to it in
order that the subsequent milestones and the end-to-end lead-times are achieved.
The types of change that relate to each category are defined in [section 4].

These lead-times apply for the volumes given in [section 6].

The lead-time runs from initiating a change until the change is Released to the live
system.

For information only, the SLAs to be achieved as set out in the Codified Agreement,
Schedule [G10], are shown at the end of each model. The SLA applies to the
delivery of the released Reference Data not to the delivery of the OBCs.

Notes:
For simplicity, the models used do not show activities that occur in parallel.

day = working weekday (Mon-Fri, excluding English Public Holidays)
adow = any day of the week, includes non working weekdays (Mon-Sun)
times = latest time action can occur to meet the schedule

Where a time is given next to a milestone, the time is critical to achieving that
milestone. Where the time is not given, the default is for the handover between
organisations to be complete by 8am. Failure to achieve a milestone by the given (or
default) time potentially extends the lead-time of the change.

Operational Business Change - Product
Version: 6.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 13/072001

6 Volume of change

6.1 Introduction

The PON forecast volume of Operational Business Change is shown in Appendix A:
OBC Volumes for Year 2001

On a 3 monthly basis the Operational Service Review Forum will review actual and
forecast volumes to estimate the impact on future capacity and lead-times.

6.2 Committed volumes

The parties agree that the PON Dec ‘99 estimate in [Appendix A] is deemed to be
the baseline volume of OBCs for this agreement for the year 2001. The Reference
Data Operational Review Forum will review both changes to forecast and actuals
against the baseline.

The baseline for Reference Data record changes is given in the AIS [ref. 5].

Data, which is required specifically for the implementation of a new system release
(e.g. CSR+), is exceptional to these committed volumes and as such will not be
accounted within any measurement against this Agreement.

Where:

e the quarterly forecast figures (or observed actuals) for a rolling 12 month period,
show an increase of more than 15% on the baseline for the (aggregated) total of
all OBCs or for all Reference Data records or

e Fast-track changes (excepting Migration Specials) exceed 10% of the rolling
annual total volume of changes, then

a Change Request (CR) is required for full impacting of the resource needed to
deliver the end-to-end process and to establish a new baseline.

Where these limits are exceeded changes will be processed as exceptions [see
section 9.2].

N.B. Changes requested directly by ICL Pathway or required to support a major
system upgrade or as otherwise agreed (e.g. database tidying activity) may be
excluded from change volumes by agreement between PON and ICL Pathway.

6.2.1 Peaks in Business Change activity

e Where the total volume of Business changes raised in any week is no more than
15% above the baseline, the changes will be processed to meet the agreements
specified in this document.

Operational Business Change - Product
Version: 6.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 13/072001

e Where the total volume of Business changes raised in any week is more than
15% above the baseline, this is termed a ‘peak’.

e Where the ‘peak’ is between 15% and 30% above the baseline, notification must
be given at least 1 week in advance, for the changes to be processed to meet the
agreements specified in this document.

e Where the ‘peak’ is between 30% and 50% above the baseline, notification must
be given at least 4 weeks in advance, for the changes to be processed to meet
the agreements specified in this document.

e Where the total volume of Business changes raised in any week is anticipated to
be greater than 50% above the baseline, or where the notice period of a peak is
not possible, the changes will be treated as an exception [see section 9.2].

« Where sufficient notice of an increase in volume over 50% above the baseline is
available, a CR can be raised to change the baseline.

e Where the total volume of Business changes is greater than 20% above the
baseline, over a 3-month period, a CR is required to change the baseline
volumes.

RDORF will ensure that there is careful co-ordination of each component of the
change(s) and will prioritise between current work, where necessary.

Examples of peak activity are end of year and tariff changes.

a) End of year

The end of financial year changes will normally represent a peak in change activity.

Changes that can be expected at this time of year include:

e Cash Account changes (which are not covered by OBC processes but do need to
be co-ordinated with the OBC activity)

e changes caused by Budget decisions

e other product changes, e.g. Tariff Change or the introduction of new Homecare
Stamp Changes.

PON and ICL Pathway will plan and manage these changes as separate peak

change projects.

b) Tariff changes

A Tariff Change may include new product introduction, revaluation, price changes
and/or scales data changes, with multiple changes of each type. It may cause a
large overhead on verification, particularly of scales data, and requires careful co-
ordination, as well as being open to last minute amendment by Postwatch.

7 Deliverables
To ensure milestones are not put at risk all deliverables must be:

Complete and identifiable e.g. cross referencing change numbers

Error free [see section 9.3 for managing errors]

Correctly dated (see section 7.3)

Delivered by the relevant deadlines set out in the Interface Agreement [see
section 5 for required milestones]

e Delivered through the agreed mechanisms.

7.1 PON to ICL Pathway

PON shall deliver to ICL Pathway:

1) Reference Data for Advanced and Basic changes

2) Operational Business Change forms for Advanced changes

3) Supporting items and/or information appropriate for changes e.g. AP tokens,
Counter News

4) Authorisation for Advanced and High Risk Basic changes

5) Volumetric forecasts, including peaks

7.2 ICL Pathway to PON
ICL Pathway shall deliver to PON:

1) Reference Data direct to Live Counters, for OBCs that are pre-authorised by
PON.
2) Reference Data to Verification Counters, for OBCs to be verified, and that:
e include Type C Reference Data for Advanced changes when necessary
« has been validated to ensure changes work as requested on the OBC forms.
3) Verification and Comparison Reports (as appropriate) that identify exactly what
changes to the counter have been implemented
4) Reports to RDORF on volumetrics, including observed peaks.

7.3 Future Dating

Reference Data records contain a ‘Start Date’ which is the date on which the change
is to become effective on the Horizon counters. This date should always be in the
future when the data is created and remain a ‘future date’ throughout processing
and distribution so that it is still a future date when it arrives at the counters.

There is a risk to PON if the OBC process is not initiated sufficiently in advance of
the Start Date to allow for:

ICL Pathway ICL Pathway / PON Interface Agreement for Ref: CS/PRD/058
Operational Business Change - Product
Version: 6.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 13/072001

e the IFA lead-time for processing, validation, authorisation and release to the Live
system for that particular type of change

« the distribution time to outlets

e additional contingency where PON consider the Reference Data to have
business critical importance

Where, for whatever reason, PON are unable to initiate the OBC process sufficiently
in advance, then PON and ICL Pathway would establish an Agreed Date to
supersede the Start Date.

ICL Pathway reserves the right to log as a pre-live incident, the receipt of any
Reference Data which is not future dated. This is because data which has an
immediate start date (i.e. any date in the past at the time when the data reaches the
Horizon counter) may have an adverse effect and may create additional calls to
HelpDesks.

The scheduling of non-future dated data by OSG delaying authorisation of the
release of Reference Data is not an approved method.

request from PON to ICL Pathway, for Advanced Changes.

e The receipt of a Reference Data file containing only Basic (Class 1 Reference
Data) in the RDMC, is the confirmed request for change from PON to ICL
Pathway.

e The receipt of a correctly completed Authorisation Form from PON is the
confirmed authorisation to release the change.

« The receipt of pre-authorised change files (e.g. Migration Special or Pure Basic)
clearly identified as such and containing that type of change, is the authorisation
for release of the changes.

e Requests for non-OBC changes (i.e. those not defined in the RDCC [ref. 2]) will
not be accepted and need to be submitted as a Change Request. However, the
change request may also initiate an update to the RDCC so that new changes
are introduced to the OBC process, where agreed. In many cases once a CR
has been approved the delivery mechanisms will be the same as, or similar to,
those used for OBC.

9.2 Exceptions

Exceptions, e.g. to volumes or lead-times, will be processed using available
resources without any guarantee of service delivery. Both PON and ICL Pathway
shall notify the other party when a request is recognised to be an exception.
Note: An agreed Deviation to the Service (e.g. Reference Data necessary for the
implementation of a new system release such as CSR+) is not an exception.

PON may wish to change the priority of an exceptional change so that it is given
preference over normal changes. In this instance the agreed lead-times may be
extended pro rata for displaced activities.

9.3 Errors and Rework

N.B. This section relates to errors or rework for both Product and Outlet Reference
Data, where appropriate.

9.3.1 Recording Pre-Live Incidents

All observed errors will be recorded as pre-live incidents in accordance with the
OLAs (refs. 12 & 13). The change will be suspended awaiting corrective action,
potentially delaying the achievement of that milestone for all changes affected by the
error. For example, a file containing records that are rejected will not be processed
until the rejected records are corrected and any other change which is in any way
associated with the rejections may also be delayed. Where the achievement of a
milestone is at risk, corrective action will be taken by the appropriate party or
parties, by agreement, in order to achieve the final milestone, where possible.

A pre-live incident will be raised for late deliverables.

If the Start Date contained within Reference Data record is not future dated or is set
to a date prior to the Required Date a pre-live incident will be raised i.e. the Start
Date is either prior to the date on the OBC form, or is not consistent with the overall
lead-times (see section 7.3).

If it is known that the final milestone will not be achieved, or an alert has been
requested and the data is being released and will become active on the following
day an Alert may be necessary as described in section 2.5.

9.3.2 Rework categorisation and thresholds

Rework files are files which are, or appear to be, either Amendment files or Error
Corrections files to a change that is currently being progressed. They necessitate
additional activity by all parties and as such may have an impact on lead-times.

DN: the remainder of this section is still subject to review between PON and
ICL Pathway and anticipates the inclusion of Reference Data for Outlet
Change.

Appropriate steps shall be taken to establish and eliminate the root cause of
Rework.

9.4 Escalation

Disagreements about the service e.g. whether a change is exceptional, will be
raised, and wherever possible resolved, at the RDORF. If agreement cannot be
reached at the RDORF, either party may invoke formal escalation mechanisms.

9.5 Charging

« AP Client Take-On is charged as specified [see ref. 3].
« Deviations to the service will be charged as per the CCN.
e Invoices will be raised and paid in accordance with Schedule A10.
