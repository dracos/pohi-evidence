Mark - I'm happy with your suggestion.
All - Slight tweak in yellow below because there are definitely users at FU who have this access (confirmed by Deloitte).

Database and server access and edit permission can-be is provided, within strict controls, to a small, controlled number
of specialist Fujitsu personnel. Use of these permissions is logged but rare. Enquiries are continuing as to whether this
particular form of access could be used to affect a branch's accounts, and if so, whether this has happened.

Would it help to include "whether this particular form of access" in final sentence which emphasises that we've never
actually been asked about super users but are going over and beyond to establish position?

So sorry to miss call.

Mark

in response to your question in the other email thread about seeing everything we have said about
“remote access", we don't have a central log of everything POL has said on remote access. However,
the language used in the email referenced below (attached again) is reflective of the language used by
POL towards the end of the Scheme.

We have also previously compiled POL's comments on this topic that were made in individual case
reports (see attached), which gives a flavour of the responses given. This should however be treated
with caution as these responses span a two year period and POL's understanding of the situation
changed over time.

One of the tasks we could do (albeit this will need to be after the LOR has been sent) is to compile a
complete chronology of what POL was told and what POL has said on this topic. One to discuss on our
call later

Kind regards
Andy

Quote from SS’ Report:

“This ability to directly amend branch records is something that Post Office has consistently denied was
possible. This recently discovered evidence appears to confirm, that in 2010 at least, it was possible for
Fujitsu / Post Office to directly amend branch data without the knowledge of the relevant
Subpostmaster.

14.16. In commenting on a draft of this report Post of Office told us that the references to “amend” and
“correct” in the documents mentioned above, are not strictly correct as neither Post Office nor Fujitsu
have the ability to directly change or delete existing records. All that can be done is that additional
records can be added by Post Office / Fujitsu without the consent (and possibly the knowledge) of the
relevant Subpostmaster. This will, however, have the effect of altering balances at the branch, as both
debit and credit entries can be made.

14.17. Post Office also told us:

“All of the above processes for correcting / updating a branch's accounts have similar features. All of
them involve inputting a new transaction into the branch's records (not editing or removing any previous
transactions) and all are shown transparently in the branch transaction records available to
Subpostmasters (as well as in the master ARQ data).

The language used in the documents produced by Post Office / Fujitsu and to which you refer is
unfortunate colloquial shorthand used by those working on the Horizon system. I can see how it could be
read to suggest that Post Office was "altering" branch data but the above explains why this is not the
case.”

14.18. This is not something that we have been able to test or validate.

POL-0026480
POL00029998
POL00029998

14.19. Clearly, the fact that such an ability exists, is not necessarily evidence that such ‘amendments’
were actually made. This is not something that we have been able to investigate.

This section of the Report was based on the attached email sent to Second Sight.

Exactly - it's hard to assess this without seeing what we've previously said

Thanks Andy

Would you please circulate the extract “The use of balancing transactions was explained
to Second Sight and is referenced in its Part Two Report at paragraph 14.16.” so that we
can see what was referenced at the time.

Subject: Remote Access wording - subject to litigation privilege [BD-4A.FID26859284]

All

Please find attached the proposed wording on the remote access issue — for discussion
on our call at 6pm today.

Three points to bear in mind when reviewing:

1. In light of comments yesterday, we've provided a slightly longer explanation so to
hopefully present this issue in a better light.

2. Tony agrees with the current wording but has reiterated the importance of dealing
with this point candidly, even if that does cause some short-term pain.

3. We do not yet have a 100% clear picture on some of the technical and operation
issues on this topic. We therefore need to be careful not to overstate our
case. This draft wording will also need to be run past Deloitte / FJ.

Kind regards
Andy
