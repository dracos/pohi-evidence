Detailed Agenda Items 07.04.16

e Sunday 03.04.16 planned outage which had been communicated to Network by
Message Broadcast (MBS) but an alert went out to key stakeholders stating
multiple users unable to access Horizon.

e 31.03.16 Paystation ™ Bill Payments Incident No. I/8819908- Transaction
Acknowledgements (TAs) not received into branch from Tuesday of that week
(advice is to wait 48 hours before reporting) NBSC gave the alert to Atos once
calls started to come into NBSC 31.03.16. Communication didn’t get sent to
Network until Friday 12.15 pm (MBS 048) even though Atos had been notified
by Jackie Witham Finance Service Centre (FSC) on Thursday 31.03.16.
Notification had been sent to Atos by email (Jackie Witham FSC) rather than
being telephoned to them. Clarity needed on who takes ownership and who
monitors spikes for transactions failing as NBSC/Network branches should have
been made aware earlier.

¢ 26.03.16 - 30.03.16 Horizon balancing Issues-master incident Ref 18808466
other reference numbers include 18798391 / 1722589 / A11943675. Branches
started to ring into NBSC to report mismatched figures when balancing. Issues
reported to Atos however Atos, including Ian Humphries, were referring the

calls back to NBSC. the root cause of balancing errors has been identified as an
issue with the reference data for a small AP scheme known as Your Housing
Group. Fujitsu reported that there were just over 100 branches that had
transacted against the problematic scheme, fix put in place but could have been
done much earlier.

e 22.02.16 Moneygram Error code 99, error code 1204, impact to branches has
been ongoing since changes to product in November 2015. NBSC process is to
report an increase in calls from Network branch to Atos. Atos in turn were
referring branches back to NBSC. Comms to Network have been consistently
slow and this increases calls into NBSC.

« 10.07.15 TC acceptance problem Ref: 17644212. First reported to Atos by FSC
on 10.07.15. NBSC subsequently flagged further incidents from branches. Atos
kept stating user error and it took until 07.09.15 for Atos & Fujitsu to confirm
that there is a bug - a fix will need to be developed, tested and rolled out.
We're still awaiting confirmation that the fix implemented on 14.09.15 was
successful, that no further incidents have been raised and no branch was
adversely affected. (including any branch who may not have raised an issue)
NBSC 50% over forecast but calls should have gone to Atos and been managed
by them. Wednesday Call

e 06.06.15-Branches were forced to declare cash and found discrepancies I their
sales reports. NBSC raised the incidents to Atos but it took a number of calls
before the issue was investigated. Wednesday Call

e Disconnected sessions/Stuck transactions- now resolved but it took over a year
to get Atos to reinstate a process that should have been baton passed on
Service Integration. BIMS process between branch, Fujitsu and POL Finance
Service Centre. Branches were being referred back to NBSC to ask for “POL to
authorise deletion of transactions” this caused concern within POL & legal teams
as sessions cannot be deleted. Throughout Second Sight case management our
statement has always been that transactions are corrected with a full audit trail
retained. Wednesday Call

e Further examples are :-

¢ Unable to connect to datacentre 25.10.16 189 calls to NBSC.

« Camelot Lottery changes (13,14,15 October 2015) to £2.00 free ticket. Impact
to Network significant, impact to NBSC 12.10 63% 105% 107% 84% 47% 34%
over forecast (forecast 10190 got 18257 calls offered).

e Drop & Go- multiple issues.

e Health Lottery- October 2015 branches unable to process prize payments (who
should test changes prior to go live, who communicates, who monitors spikes
with transactions/transactions failing?)

e October 2014 onwards-AP mismatches as a result of faulty barcode reader. The
issue is that a branch user scans an AP transaction with a bar code reader all

works fine, when the next customer arrives with an AP barcode the payment
the customer makes goes to the previous client account with all future
customer barcode scanned payments taken on that particular terminal in that
branch defaulting to the first client account at the time the barcode reader
becomes faulty. The incidents are resolved by replacing the barcode reader
once the branch or customers alert the IT helpdesk or CCU of the problem. By
this time however a number of customer payments may have gone to the
wrong client. FSC have a process for putting things right but it relies on the
customer, client or occasionally the branch alerting IT service desk or POL that
something has gone wrong, this doesn’t always happen and FSC hold the
amount pending resolution. Still awaiting an explanation from Fujitsu/Atos.
Wednesday Call.

e Change Request for third party supplier information- Still outstanding first
flagged in April 2014. Questions now raised regarding who and how supplier
contracts are managed? What call logs/engineer information is within their
contract to supply? What happens when suppliers move on? Wednesday Call.
Request for IT attendance on Wednesday call.

e IT & EUC issues affecting NBSC/CCU/POEx- BT cloud admin access rights
ongoing since 2-3 weeks. Drives down 04.04.16. New AD users ongoing since
Jan 2016. BT cloud outage Sun 14.02.16 cloud outages 4 times a day ever
since. Calls from branch and customers cut off. Failures with Dynamics logging
tool and still no access to full reporting suite.
