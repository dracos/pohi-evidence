Executive Summary: Overview

Background I The Post Ofce Limited network of some 14,000 brenches processes client and business transections in excess of £100 bilion annually. The msjoiy of

transactions are conducted on behalf of other partes, for example, receiving payment for domestic ullit bls and paying out National Savings.
‘Customer transactions are captured through the Horizon Electronic Point of Sale equipment in branches, and dally summaries are transmitted overnight to the
‘central accounting system, POL FS (a standard SAP system). The translaion process between the Iwo systems is enabled by the Reference Dala System
(RDS) and this system provides a mechanism to manage the portfolio of clients, branches and products.

‘The POL FS system was implemented in 2005/06 and contains functionality to calculate branch balances (cash, stocks, suspense, debiors and creditors) and
to satte client balances. Additonaly, the data from branches populates a Management information System (MIS).

Objective I Tere hat herevised central accounting procedures implemented inthe POL FS system are adequate fo maintain the integrity of accounting data
1d Scope I MASTER DATA: Amendments to produc, ranch, cent, customer and General Ledger (GL) data are processed in an accurate and timely manner.

and SCOPE] BRANCH TRANSACTIONS: Transactional data is received from branches in an accurate and timely manner and branch balances can be substariiated

‘CENTRAL ACCOUNTING: Significant Branch Discrepancies (BDs) are investigated and processed consistently: settlements with clients are processed in

‘eccordance with client agreements; suspense items are promplly resolved; and summary transections are posted ino the POL financial accounts

‘Audit Rating I AREA CONTROL ENVIRONMENT: Some Improvement Required. Processes to retieve data from branches and post transactions into POL finns

‘counts operate satisfactorily, Further work is required to resolve suspense account aged balances and branch discrepancies.
GROUP IMPACT: Low. At the Group level the impact of issues identified in this report is ow.

‘Overal, the extraction of financial records from branches by Fujitsu and the processing of these by the Product and Branch Accounting department was
‘operating as prescribed. The POL FS system enables transactional data to be inlerrogated and there is an opportunity to enhance the efficiency and
‘effectiveness of this functionally

Issues identiid in the review are:

Branch Discrepancies: Branch Discrepancies and Transaction Corrections (TCs) totalled £2:3m at P9, of which 38% related to the prior financial year. If
‘hese are not resolved, the risk of bad debis increases,

‘Suspense accounts: There were 17 suspense accounts, wth balances ranging from £1k to £2.8m and the net total being £2.2m debit, containing a high level
‘of aged balances. Any delays in clearing these accounts makes reconciliation more ficult and may require adkitional resource to resoive.

Moneygram transactions: There were discrepancies between the Moneygram transactional data (upon which POL make settlements) and the data recorded
Jn POL FS. At P11, £472k of transactions required investigation. Moneygram did not appear to be cooperating fuly with ongoing investigalions. These
discrepancies need tobe resolved to minimise the risk of bad debts and respond tothe possibly of fraud as @ reason.

‘Customer master data: Internally, dala from the SAP HR system is uploaded into RDS. Missing and incorrect customer master data resulted in a high evel of
‘Upload failures (failure rate in January 2007: 23%), This causes additonal costs in rework, and also risks Impacting customer goodail (e.9, when transactions
‘are not recorded on a timely basis, causing unnecessary TCs to be issued),

41. Suspense account management
‘Suspense accounts are reconciled and reported via Probity Statements on a
monthly basis. Various suspense accounts include excessive aged items,
requiting addon resource to resolve.

(Owing to restructuring within Product and Branch Accounting (P&BA), root
cause analysis of some suspense accounts has been delayed, Furthermore,
detailed knowedge and understanding of some accounts has been
diminished after internal restructuring or individuals leaving the business,
Before the commencement of ths review the issue of suspense account
management had been identified by the POL team and a series of workshops
arranged to identify root causes. Progress in the majority of cases is
satisfactory

(Our assessment of the individual suspense accounts overleaf reflects the
positon of the accounts at PS and the level of work required to bring the
account toa satisfactory status, on the folowing basis:

+ Account cleared on a timely basi;

+ Corrective action underway; and

+ Further oot couse analysis required

Business impact: Delays in completing reconciliations may mean that any
errors in suspense accounts remain undetected for longer. Also, the delays
‘mean that the business may incur addtional costs to reconcile the accounts,

+ Use the workshops to develop action plans and Rod Ismay
subsequent resolution for the problem suspense accounts,
(Prionty 2)

+ Document current understanding of accounting processes Rod iemay
to provide continuity of control of these accounts.

2. Discrepancies exist between Moneygram transactional data (upon
‘which POL make settlements) and the data recorded in POL FS

Issues have been identified within the process that reconciles the differences
between Client Transacton Summaries (CTS) & POL FS. CTS data is
supplied by Fujitsu and is based on transactions recorded on Horizon in the
branch network. POL FS data is based on @ fle sent by Moneygram and
loaded into POL FS. Transactions claimed by Moneygram do not match with
CTS date.

Moneyoram services are available at some 3,350 branches, allowing
customers to undertake electronic fund transfers to foreign bank accounts
fand generating commission income of some £6.5 millon per annum,
Historically, these transacfons have taken place via a Moneygram terminal or
by the POL clerk making a phone call fo instruct the transfer. All transactions
should be recorded on Horizon

Queries have been sent to Moneyoram yet no response has been received.
POL Investigations Team (POL IT) are considering potential intemal fraud for
some of the transactions. However, itis not clear what action is being taken
with regard to potential raud within the Moneygram organisatin.

POL and Moneygram are currently testing an automated process to eliminate
transactions via phone calls and to replace the Moneygram terminals,
Transactions will be entered directly onto the Horizon terminal and sent to
Moneygram via a webserver.

Business impact: The business may incur bad debts if i does not resolve
these issues. Also, investigations require signficant resource, which may
detract focus from other business priorities.

+ Agree resolution with Moneyoram for curent issues
including establishing bad debt provisions as eppropriat,
‘and estabish 9 process for identifying fraudulent
transactions and communication to POL IT on a timely
basis,

+ Inilste @ process to monitor contract performance and

3. At P9, blocked Branch Discrepancies and Transaction Corrections
totalled some €2.3m, 38% of which related to the prior financial year,
Generally, oly disputed BDs are investigated with payment expected for all
other items, Each Product team maintains a list of those items under
investigation or in dispute. There are limited local guidelines on how to
investigate, subsequently the majorly of the process is subjective.

‘The Current Agents Debt team maintain a listing of the frequency of disputed
BDs. This is informally used to highlight potential ongoing issues (none
Noted). All blocked transactions (ie. disputed BDs and TCs) are logged in
POL FS and available to view. At PS there were some 1,440 items
outstanding (some £2:3 milion), with 331 items (some £884k) from the
previous financial year.
