Dear

Thank you for your further letter in response to mine of 30 March, concerning your
daughter, Mrs Wolstenholme, and the termination of her contract as subpostmaster
at Cleveleys Modified Sub Post Office.

In my previous letter, I referred to extensive contact between your daughter and
PON regional staff which is consistent with the position described in your letter. As
I also indicated in my letter of 30 March, it would be for Mrs Wolstenholme to initiate
any representations she wished to make to Eric Logan.

As previously explained, the Government does not intervene in operational matters
relating to the postal businesses. These include the terms and arrangements
relating to subpostmasters which are governed by the contract which each
subpostmaster signs prior to taking up the appointment. Your daughter would need
to take legal advice if she considers that termination contravened the contractual
terms or her rights under the contract.

Yours sincerely

Mike Whitehead
Postal Services Directorate
