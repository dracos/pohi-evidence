Angela,

Mrs Pugh was sub postmistress at Chirbury Post Office from 21 April 1999 to 3 September 2001 when
her Contract for Services was suspended.

The final audit of accounts resulted in a deficiency of £9,601.11 but many error notices were later issued
which increased the overall debt to £31,128.18.

The question of recovery of this debt has been referred to Jim Cruise of our Legal Services Department
to pursue the debt on our behalf.

A case Management Conference was heard on the 8th January 2004 and the Court has ordered an
exchange of witness statements by 22nd April 2004 with a further Case Management Conference
scheduled Thusday 13th May 2004 at Welshpool County Court.

Our Legal Services Department have asked us to prepare a number of statements regarding various
accounting errors that form part of the debt and we are in the process of preparing these.

However, there are a number of other issues that our Legal Dept require clarification and statements are
needed regarding the final audit and the PO accounting system.

It would be very much appreciated if you could provide any assistance with the following items or perhaps
advise who the best person(s) is/are to contact regarding them:-

(1) the Defence alleges that the introduction of the Horizon system itself caused problems and evidence
is needed about the training given to Mrs Pugh and, if possible, evidence of the call logs to show
whether Mrs Pugh was seeking help in relation to the operation of the system.

(2) it is said that the telephone link was cut between February and June 2001 and our Solicitors are
asking if this could be confirmed if at all possible.

(3) our Solicitors would like a statement about the closure of the Office on 31st August 2001 and what
happened on the day and what documents were taken away and why. The final cash account is in fact
dated 3rd September 2001 and an explanation is needed for the difference in dates. The names of people
who were present at the audit is also requested (it would seem as though the name of Janice Holmes has
been mentioned at some point in time as being the duty manager for the audit - could this be confirmed
and, if so, does she still work for PO Ltd.

(4) a general statement is required as to how the accounting system works at a sub post office and how
the documents are created. The Defence make reference to PO Limited's documents being self created
and our Sols would like to explain how the system works. If a short report could be prepared our
Solicitors will prepare a statement from that report.

Many Thanks!

Clive W. Burton
