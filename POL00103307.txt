Subject: ARC action - Postmaster Litigation funding
Dear All

Please see below an email from Jane to cover the action from the ARC.

Thanks

Dear All

Further to the question raised at the ARC as to how the postmaster action against POL was being funded, please see
below:

The claim is being funded by Therium Litigation Funding IC (http://www.therium.com).

e@ The Claimants have entered into individual Conditional Fee Arrangements with Freeths. The details of these
arrangements are confidential to Freeths and the claimants, and have not therefore been shared with us.

e The Claimants also have the benefit of Legal Expenses Insurance (underwritten by QBE, CBL Insurance and
Sompo Canopius). We have been provided with redacted copies of the policy documents, and are taking advice
on their adequacy to provide security for costs should we be successful in our defence of the Claim.

Kind regards,
Jane
