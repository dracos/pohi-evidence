[this problem is more serious than it looks and may explain live calls where
lusers have been managing to log on at 2 counters at the same time.

hat this bug also allows while a user is performing a Trial Cash Account
print/preview on one counter is for him to log on at a second counter with
the Office Balancing button initially locked but becoming unlocked after some
seconds. This explains how the user on live PinICL 64421 managed to do this.

to clarify further, the Session Transfer message appears whenever a session
transfer is attempted while the system is busy (e.g. building a picklist,
reparing a report).

tt is a problem in M1 and needs to go to RMF for approval to fix as soon as
jpossible. However, it's not absolutely clear where the problem lies. It may
pe a StopDeskTransfer problem and this needs to be looked at in the first
instance. I've talked with Rex Dixon who is going to look at the problem
first.

[the Escher code for the first login on C03 generates an
kapplication:$TransFlush> message. This is picked up by the StopDeskTransfer
agent on C01, As C01 is locked to the user, this StopDeskTransfer will
lattempt to write a response persistent object with <TransferFailed:reason>.
In this case, it would appear that StopDesk?ransfer's attempt to write the
reponse mist have failed or been timed out. This can happen because there is
la Riposte transaction in porogress on that counter.

m_ C03, when the user backs off the first attempt to login while still
Waiting for this reponse, the second attempt should have done the same thing,
land written another <Application:$TransFlush> message. This does not appear
tc have happened, so the first suspect must be the Escher login code.

II need a copy of the message store generated by this sequence of events to
confirm or otherwise deny this hypothesis, and have asked Les Ong to supply.

lbate:20-Apr-2001 17:05:00 User:Les Ong
I've checked the messages generated when session transfer is instigated and
found that the current version of Riposte does not write a $transflush
essage. Instead, another format message is written. It looks like Escher
Ihave revised the way that they handle session transfer:-
Riposte 223 update 18a

kel ler 1D:MIGRO1><UserName :MIGcssp<FlushNodeId:1><Application
kiposte 223 update 27
essions><ObjectNams

‘ransFlush>

State:RequestingTransfer><IdTra

so somewhere between updates 18A and 27A Riposte has changed. Should we be
jusing $TransFlush anyway? Doesn't the dollar implies that this is internal to
lsscher.

User:Les Ong

Because this problem does not seem to exist with Riposte update 18A, my
assertion that this could explain live problems is incorrect. The system will
not. move beyond 18A until M1 goes in.

lhe net result of this is that the StopDeskTransfer service is no longer
required. I'll leave this PinICL on TDA until we can justify a CP to remove
the service from the counter.

Priority should be reduced to D.

subject: RE: PC0065075 Update

[this PinICL has been sitting there in this state for 3 years!

[the issue is still relevant in that we have been maintaining this Agent and
he-testing it and running it on the counter at every release, however in
usiness terms it does absolutely nothing and may as well be scrapped. The
problem is that there doesn't appear to be any mechanism to remove such code.
tf a CP were to be raised, the chances are that a number of people would
introduce costs for changing it, and it would be considered to be to
laifficult to fit into a release. Feel free to try if you like.

i suspect it will probably stay in this state until we move to Roadmap.
jeanwhile if anybody ever finds a bug in it, then the simplest thing is to
kill it!
