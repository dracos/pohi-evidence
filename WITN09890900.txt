POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

NINTH WITNESS STATEMENT OF SIMON RECALDIN

1 1, Simon Recaldin, of 100 Wood Street, London, EC2V 7ER, will say as
follows:

INTRODUCTION

2 I am employed by Post Office Limited (“Post Office”), as the Director of

the Remediation Unit (“RU”) (previously also referred to as the Historical
Matters Business Unit ("HMU")). I have held this role since 10 January

2022. My line manager is Post Office’s Interim Chief Operating Officer.

3 In my role I have oversight of all matters relating to the Post Office
remediation schemes and the payment of redress. This includes managing
the delivery of the Horizon Shortfall Scheme (“HSS”) (previously known as

the Historical Shortfall Scheme).

I make this statement on behalf of the Post Office. Except where I indicate
to the contrary, the facts and matters contained in this witness statement
are within my own knowledge. Where any information is not within my
personal knowledge, I have identified the source of my information or the
basis for my belief. BSFF have assisted me in the preparation of this

witness statement.

RULE 9 (65) REQUEST

5

I make this witness statement in response to a request dated 23 January

2025 for information pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006 regarding

arbitration in the HSS. The Inquiry’s Rule 9 request asked for a statement

to address the below, following on from my sixth statement in response to

Rule 9(56):

(a) How many applications to the Scheme have been referred to arbitration
under the Arbitration Act 1996 but are still awaiting a determination?

(b) How many applications to the Scheme have been finally determined by
arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996?

RULE 9 (65) RESPONSE

6

Further to paragraph 102 of my sixth witness statement, I confirm that it
remains the case that, to date, no HSS applications have been referred to

arbitration.

Consequently, there are no applications awaiting determination by

arbitration and no applications have been fully determined by arbitration.
