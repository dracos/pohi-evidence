Subject: Information requests following the first day looking at PEAK/TfS

Dear Sirs,

During the first day spent at Fujitsu looking at the TfS and PEAK systems, both Dr
Warden and I noted information that would be helpful in the drafting of our respective
reports.

Whilst the request for some items of information on the below list may be supported
by Dr Worden, I have been unsuccessful in gaining agreement that these should be
presented as joint requests.

It might be the case that should this information be made available, the requirement
to spend the second day at Fujitsu will not be needed.

The information requested is as follows:-

WBD_000429.000001
WBONO0000559
WBON0000559

i) Monthly service reports from HSD - Similar to the SLA report in NBSC. This will
allow the required analysis of the high-level problem types and periods.

ii) Screenshots for TfS and Peak (During the meeting Sandie offered two for TfS)

iii) List of TFS classification codes and Peak call types (with meanings)

iv) A full list of TfS’s ‘closed’ from ‘Live’ and where Classification was = ‘S. Software
SD?? *’ (plus others that may follow after we have the list from above)

v) PEAK and/or TfS records where the error or issue resulted in financial impact to
either Post Office or a Subpostmaster.

vi) PEAK and/or TfS records for any Claimant who has a record including any audit
data for the period (at least a month) of the PEAK/TfS record.

vii) The ‘filtered’ data (ARQ's). We have the unfiltered data but PO was making TC
decisions based on the filtered not the unfiltered. I need to understand the delta of
the two. [Already requested in Freeths 15 and 22 June 2018 Letters]

viii) A copy of any Master Service Change ("MSC") OR Operational Corrective
Requests ("OCR") OR Operation Control Procedures ("OCP") [as outlined in POL-
0074909] where the data to be changed has had a financial impact on Post Office or
where they relate to fixing a peak.

Kind Regards,
