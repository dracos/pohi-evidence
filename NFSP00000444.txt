Peter Corbett had been approached along with Tony Marsh
who had been on holiday. Further approaches to be made. ACTIO
Letter from Graham Meacher. Dave Miller had been
approached a month prior to his departure and he was
convinced that Post Office Limited should be asking the Inland
Revenue what they were asking Subpostmasters to do. The
issue was referred to Tony Marsh, and he appeared to have
done nothing about it.

Moratorium had been requested on payment, and Post Office
Limited threatened with injunction if they failed to deal with the
issue.
If nothing wrong, Subpostmasters should not be asked to make
good - status quo.

Steps to improve security already taking place.

Time lapse not reasonable - agreed. Post Office Limited tum
around in 2 weeks but delay was prior to them getting there.

To be treated as a major crime and investigated overall, not as
individual cases.

Inland Revenue had a major fraud and needed to do something
to protect themselves.

Inland Revenue argue they pay Subpostmasters to get it right.
Hard to see what is wrong even when you know there is a

problem. Work in progress.
Needs to be made clear that the work was ongoing anyway,
and was not prompted by Graham Meacher’s letter.
