1.0 Summary

The existing Horizon Systems Helpdesk (HSH) provides a call handling facility to Post Office
Ltd. that is not fully ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library), compliant in the following areas:

¢ There is no dedicated end-to-end incident management function

« Where incident management does exist, this is often hampered by the organisational
structure with certain functions (Service Management Centre: SMC) outside of the main
service desk area

¢ There is no dedicated problem management function, where this is required in conjunction
with Post Office Account (POA). Although not specifically and ITIL requirement of a
service desk, we believe a compliant desk should assist Post Office Account (POA) in
carrying out the Problem Management process by providing trend analysis of incidents
received and the subsequent initiation of problem records where required for ongoing
investigation and resolution by POA.

e The existing configuration and asset management systems are not exploited fully in the
handling of incidents received. The Horizon Service Desk (HSD) will be fully reliant on
POA for all necessary system links and associated service requirements. A separate
programme of work is being carried out within POA to review the entire Configuration
and Asset management systems and any developments which impact the HSD will be
covered by a separate Change Proposal (CP) once this work has been completed.

¢ Call management within the POA Service Delivery Units (SDU’s), does not facilitate
accurate reporting and impact assessment of incidents

« The call management system (Powerhelp) requires development to assist in improved
incident management

Following the POA Red Alert and the subsequent review of service and technology by
external consultants it was recommended that POA create an ITIL compliant service desk
function, hereon known as the Horizon Service Desk (HSD), to address the above.

This set of requirements, underpins CP3947 which has been raised to approve the transition of
the existing HSH into the HSD within four phases:

¢ Phase One: Implemented from 07/02/05
« Phase Two: Implemented from 01/04/05
¢ Phase Three: Implemented from 01/07/05
¢ Phase Four: Implemented from 01/10/05

2.0 Document Scope

This requirements definition describes the underlying processes / resources that it is believed
are required to ensure the transition from the HSH to the HSD within the above timescales
and gives the information to enable Core Services to impact CP3947.

3.0 Phase One: Implemented 07 February 2005

3.1 Implementation of reactive Incident Management within the
existing Horizon Systems Helpdesk

3.1.1 POA have currently implemented the process whereby all post office branches are
telephoned with an incident progress report within 24 elapsed hours where an incident
is unresolved and then at 24 hour intervals, or when further updates are received, until
the incident is resolved.

3.1.2. POA will transfer responsibility for this process to the HSD with effect from Phase
Two.

3.1.3. The HSH will continue to follow the agreed call script advising post office branches
calling the HSH in relation to on line services being unavailable that their service will
usually be restored after the initial 48 hours have elapsed. In the event that the service
is not restored, the branch will be telephoned on a daily basis with updates as to the
progression to resolution of the incident.

4.0 Phase Two: Implemented from 01 April 2005

4.1 Creation of the HSD Incident Management Team (IMT)

4.1.1 It is expected that the IMT will be based in Stevenage 09 and be co-located within the
same area as the Front Line Call Agents.

4.1.2. The IMT will be ring-fenced and will not be used to support the Front Line Agents
without due consideration as to the effect on Service Level Target (SLT) conformance
or to the detriment of the incident management function. Where there is a potential
conflict of interest the HSD will discuss the allocation of resource with POA Service
Management.

4.1.3. The IMT functionality will be delivered via a dedicated Team Manager following the
full impact assessment of resource requirements. The Team Manager will have or will
strive to obtain ITIL accreditation in IT Service Management during 2005.

4.1.4 The IMT team members will, where possible, be developed in the knowledge of the
ITIL principles around Incident and Problem Management.

4.1.5 The HSD will take over the process described within 3.1.1 and telephone all branches
within 24 hours elapsed time where an incident is unresolved and then at 24-hour
intervals, or when further updates are received, until the incident is resolved.

4.2 Implementation of pro-active Incident Management Within
the IMT

4.2.1 The IMT will monitor all incidents against contractual SLT’s.

4.2.2 Where an unresolved incident is approaching the point at which conformance to the
appropriate SLT is threatened, (NB: This point needs to be defined), the IMT will
chase the appropriate SDU for progress updates. Powerhelp / Phoenix to flag when
this point is reached

4.2.3. Where progress updates suggest that conformance to SLT will not be achieved, the
IMT will obtain the estimated time of resolution from the SDU and communicate this
by telephone to the incident raiser. This action shall be reported against the appropriate
incident log within Powerhelp.

4.2.4 Should the IMT gain an unsatisfactory response from an SDU following a progress
chase, the issue will be escalated to POA Service Management who will then own the
responsibility for progressing the incident to conclusion with the SDU.

4.2.5 The IMT will then provide regular progress updates every (7BA) hours to the incident
raiser should the incident remain unresolved.

NB: Refer to Service Level Targets Document for specific SLT measures.

4.3 Implementation of pro-active Problem Initiation within the
IMT

43.1 The HSD will create a “Problem Management” stack within Powerhelp. This stack will
be used to log problems in accordance with Section 3.4 of the document entitled:
Horizon Service Desk, Service Description. Ref: CS/SER/023

4.3.2 POA will allocate a dedicated POA / HSD Problem Manager to the HSD. This
resource will report into POA but will be co-located with the HSD. This resource will
filter all identified problems initiated by the IMT prior to logging on the Powerhelp
stack (see section 4.3.1) in accordance with Section 3.4 of the document entitled:
Horizon Service Desk, Service Description. Ref: CS/SER/023. The POA / HSD
Problem Manager will review the IMT output and will appoint a POA Problem
Manager where required. NB: POA will ensure the availability of this resource
working in conjunction with the HSD in providing cover during periods of absence.

4.3.3. The IMT will monitor the Problem Records within Powerhelp on a weekly basis and
escalate to the dedication POA / HSD Problem Manager where the Problem Record
appears not to have been updated or actions appear to have been delayed.

4.3.4 The IMT will ensure that any KEL delivered, as a result of problem root cause analysis
is available to the HSD.

4.4 Development and sign off of Incident and Problem
Management Processes

4.4.1 POA resource will review and if appropriate amend Incident and Problem Management
processes

4.4.2 The HSD will be required to approve with POA the Incident Management processes
within the document entitled: Incident Management Process: Ref: CS/PRD/074

describe the processes, reporting and targets used in the delivery of the HSD function
