NFSP00001044

MOTION 23

The nebulous art of conceptually selling a Branch code and the belief of Post Office Limited that this is our mutual saviour are both flawed.
Modern computer technology can surely bring insurance quotations and personal loan projections to the customer via Horizon and the back-
office printer. It seems that only the reluctance of Post Office Limited and the joint venture prevents this progress, amidst a cloud of financial
regulation and data protection.

This Conference requests that the Executive Council vigorously pursues a course of action to implement such enhancements within the next
12 months.

(Insurance quotations and personal loan projections produced via Horizon and the back office printer.)

STATUS
Formal representations continue to be made although there are issues around formal training & FSA accreditation.

changes in regulations.

(Increased remuneration for passport transactions.)

STATUS
POL has rejected our representations so far.

MOTION 43
That this Conference instructs the Executive Council to negotiate with Post Office Limited that computer generated discrepancies are not the
responsibility of the Subpostmaster.

STATUS
Where evidence exists that the error is not as a result of human input then a claim will not be pursued.

MOTION 45
That this Conference instructs the Executive Council to meet with Post Office Limited to negotiate the immediate restoration of values to the
various Horizon reports from which they have been removed.

(Restore ‘values’ on Horizon reports.)

STATUS

option.

prevent unnecessary losses, where possible criminal activity has been identified in specific geographical areas.

(Communication to offices where criminal activity is identified in specific geographical areas.)

STATUS
This is with the Security Division there does now appear to be a willingness to use the MBS’s as a means of giving out warnings as a means
of warning Subpostmasters to fraud in certain areas.

MOTION 59
The continuing failure of Post Office Ltd. to deliver an effective relationship with the branches via a Retail/Sales management facility is a

constant concern to all Subpostmasters.

This Conference requests the Executive Council to maximise its new-found closer working relationship with Post Office Limited to positively
influence the process needed to redefine the structure of Retail/Sales management for the significant financial benefit of all Subpostmasters.

(Redefine the structure of Retail/Sales Management to financially benefit Subpostmasters.)

independent arbitrator to decide on the ultimate liability of any Subpostmaster in the event of robbery/burglary in conjunction with Post Office
Limited and the NFSP.
