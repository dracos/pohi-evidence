Subject: RE: Remediation Programme

Thanks Julie,
None of this will come as a surprise but my view is that whatever remediation / compensation Scheme is set up, it
needs to:

@1 Be capable to bringing closure to this matter for interested parties.

®II To be funded appropriately to enable those affected to be properly compensated

®I1 For it to be independent of Post Office, to avoid conflicts

®II To be properly but not overly governed, so that affected individuals receive compensation swiftly

®II Not distract and therefore prevent POL from being able to deliver on its forward facing strategy

®TI Represent good value for money for the public purse — the administration of the scheme and how much that

costs must be proportionate but not to the detriment of those affected — i.e money going to law firms rather
than affected individuals

®I1 Be properly documented - processes, controls, delegated authorities, ToR.

®T The ‘client’ and decision makers must be identified and trusted.
Happy to chat through on the phone if helpful. You may also benefit from speaking to Graham Hemingway who
manages the Historical Shortfall Scheme, as there are definitely lessons to be learnt from the journey he has been on.

Hi Mark,
This might also be useful, it was the pack we initially talked through with Nick setting out how Remediation
Programmes are normally run.
Thanks
