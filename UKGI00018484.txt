Subject: RE: OFF-SEN: Post Office litigation: Appeal update

OFFICIAL SENSITIVE AND SUBJECT TO LEGAL PRIVILEGE
Jess

Another short update for Kelly on the litigation. There is no update on the substantive issues,
but the courts have pushed back the timetable (again).

e Judgment on the ‘Horizon’ trial is expected during September or October. The Court of
Appeal have now indicated they may hold the oral hearing on the question of permission
to appeal the ‘Common Issues’ judgment between 12" and 14' November. Mediation
cannot begin until after the ‘Horizon’ judgment and the Court of Appeal’s decision on
whether Post Office can appeal the ‘Common Issues’ judgment.

e We don’t expect mediation to begin before December 2019 at the earliest.

e In the meantime, POL’s legal advisers continue to develop their litigation and mediation
strategy.

A short update for Kelly on the Sparrow litigation.

¢ The Court of Appeal will hold an oral hearing on the question of permission to appeal the
‘Common Issues’ judgment on 9 October. The Court has advised that a judgment will be
made ‘as soon as possible’ afterwards, although we do not expect this to be made on
the day.

e Judgment in the ‘Horizon’ trial is also expected in September or October, and we should
have advance notice of this being issued. It is unlikely that mediation will start until the
judgment has been handed down in both cases.
