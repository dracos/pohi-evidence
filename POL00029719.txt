Looks like this branch had a different problem so was removed from the original list. The email below explains what
happened and how we advised PO on the situation.

Have an answer on second branch as well, will send that through shortly.

Hope this helps

Subject: Discrepancies raised Xmas eve - results of investigation - FINAL

Andy, Emma
POL00029719
POL00029719

Results of last part of this investigation, namely 122946 (TfS 3421481 - PC0207483)

Branch 122946 rolled from TP 4 to TP 5 on 11th August. They accepted a gain of £34330.88 which
was settled centrally. The BTS shows a trading position of £22021.65.

This branch was included in investigations into receipts and payments problems, at the beginning
of October, and was found to be a different problem from the others also under investigation at the
time, so was not included in the later spreadsheets sent to POL.

There had been a problem during migration (on the night of 4th August) of another branch, which
had a knock-on effect on this and a couple of other branches. They did migrate, apparently
successfully, but (for this branch only) the opening figures for TP 4 BP 5, which were produced on
the counter just before the Migration button was pressed, were not copied into the Branch
Database.

So when the TP rollover was done on the 11th, all stock, cash etc was treated as a gain, and the
missing Balance CFwd (21975.83 Cash+MOP, 45.82 discrepancy) resulted in the non-zero trading
position of 22021.65.

We don't fully understand how the opening figures got lost, but there's little benefit in attempting
to investigate a migration issue further, The other branches affected by the initial problem did not I
have non-zero trading positions or large gains. I
The loss of 45.82 which is stuck in the discrepancy account may need to be adjusted.

The branch didn't query the large gain at the time with our helpdesk.

In answer to the question below these are the sites being chased by Andy Winn. Can you let me know when you find
anything out about the second branch - 113459.

In the case of the first branch (122946) do we have a record of the actions taken by ourselves or PO to resolve the
migration issue?

Thanks

Thanks. Explains what we see, I can’t specifically remember any side calls being raised but was busy dealing with the
main R&P issue at the time. We will have a look to see whether anything reached PEAK but can’t search TFS as they will
have deleted any calls from that period long ago.

Cheers,

Mark, j

I’ve had a trawl through my emails and found the one below.

it makes it clear that the 2 branches Rod Ismay of POL mentioned are not part of the main Receipts Payments issue.
122946 was a migration issue in that somehow the Branch lost its opening figures on Migration.

I have no follow on emails to the one below to say if calls were raised for 113459, but it does explain why it was
removed from the spreadsheet.

Is there anything in Peak around that time?

’'m also aware that Andy Winn of POL has been chasing Steve Bansal for some other follow ups re this. Is that what this
is about?

Pete: Is it sufficient to tell Rod, that these branches were a different problem? Or do we need to try and track down
exactly what occurred? The latter could be hard and may well require an audit retrieval as a first action.

John,

Of the Branches on the sheet I passed to POL, I am aware of the following Branches that are not down to the main
problem:

4. 122946: This Branch appears to have “lost” the opening figures when it migrated.

2. 113459: This doesn’t show in POL’s analysis as being the same. Also we don't have any 902 or 903 events for this
Branch, so it looks different in my summary data

8. 374632: This appears to be a problem with Opening Figures being lost after 60 days I

4. May also be worth checking 148025. We have no 902 / 903 Events for this Branch, but POL analysis indicates a I
problem. It could just be lost events. NB this problem was in May and so may be hard to get relevant data.

Note also that POL don’t seem to have checked out all the Branches.

Regards

Gareth,

Can you identify which from your list are actually your issue and which need further investigation by us.

I will then raise the Peaks for SSC to investigate further.

All,
OK. This confirms that the issue with 122946 is something different.

It also suggests that 113459 has a different issue and so may need to be investigated separately. (I've just
checked and there were no 903 or 902 events from this branch, so that supports this.)

I see that they've not gone through the full list yet and in particular 374632 which I think is something different.
This means that the only Branch with a lost discrepancy over £1000 is 220222 (£7,044.66 to be exact).

Should we be opening new calls for these oddities or what? Dave Seddon has sent me a load more stuff on
374632, which I may try and look at, but we should really have a separate Peak and follow normal process.

What next?

Regards

Gareth

Emma,

Please can you pass this on to anybody in POL who needs it. I don’t have a full list of who was on the
call.

As promised on the call, I've tidied up the list of affected Branches and put them into the attached
spreadsheet.

<<Affected Branches.xls>>
Ive also added in a further 11 Branches that raised events as part of last week’s rollovers.

Some Branches in the list have not yet produced a BTS and so may not be aware of the problem (I've I
noted these in Col I).

I've also added in the absolute value of the lost discrepancy so as to produce totals in Row 56 as
requested by Andy Winn.

Summary is:

i
° 53 Rollovers affected i
° 2 Branches appear twice in the list (in one case it may be a duplicate of one error — this needs

further investigation)

° Net total is about £41K
° Absolute total is about £46
° Only 4 cases where amount is over £1,000

Note that in many cases the affected SU is missing from the spreadsheet. We know how to find this out,
but have not yet done so in all cases. We will clearly need to do that if we are to attempt to fix the issue
in Horizon.

Gareth
