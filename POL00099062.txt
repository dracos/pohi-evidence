All

Please find the version of the report Second Sight sent to James’s office this afternoon.

First, the good news. The first finding in the summary is still “We have so far found no evidence of system wide
(systemic) problems with the Horizon

Software”

The not so good news is that although they took on board the majority of our suggested changes, they did not for a
couple important points on Spot Review 1 ({Armstrong and the communication line failure)

Second Sight assert that the information horizon produced for the sub postmaster was not timely, accurate or
complete. We believe the evidence shows otherwise.

2. They also assert that spot review 1 exposed a system weakness. We also disagree, as the system design is on par
or better than other UK banks or retailers.

Regards, Simon
