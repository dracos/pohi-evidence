1 Horizon Directors Report

1,1 After brief introductions the meeting discussed various elements of the report and
then the Horizon Action Points from previous meetings.

2 Progress against the Master Plan and Integrated Programme Plan

2.1 Alexis Cleveland noted that in the key milestones listed under ‘Progress Against the
Master Plan and Integrated Programme Plan' Pathway were to have completed their
development work for Release 2 by 25/5/98 but that this date was now passed. .

2.2 Dave Miller explained that the work had not yet been completed as some issues
still needed resolving, which he believed the Board were already aware of. He
touched upon possible problems arising from the late completion of the Data
Interface Definition and Validation Rules (DIPVR). Vince Gaskell agreed to seck

(G . clarification.

Vince Gaskell to speak with Mike Coombes on the issues around Pathway Release 2
and the Data Interface Definition and Validation Rules DIDVR).

3. ICL Pathway Release 2 (Item 4) _,
. EPOSS Design
3.1 The Board recognised that the EPOSS development is an essential feature of

Release 2 and wanted to know what steps were being taken by Horizon to keep
Sight of the development of this system.

.

3.2 Dave Miller said that he had made a request to Mike Coombes for greater visibility
of the product. Horizon has asked for sight of the design documentation. ICL
Pathway are reluctant to allow this because they maintain that their development
structures and systems are commercially sensitive and need to be kept secure.

Dave Miller has made it clear that he is prepared to accept any security measures
ICL Pathway deem fit to protect their intellectual property, but Horizon must be
better apprised of EPOSS development.

. Detailed Testing Requirements

3.4 — There are still a number of unresolved differences between BA and Pathway over
the Detailed Testing Requirements. Dave Miller explained that there was a need
for a senior level meeting to determine exactly what the testing requirements are .
going to be. Peter Crahan said that the issygs should be tabled at the Formal

Cc Management Review Meeting on 18/6/98, The Chair sought and received

assurance that if this was not the case, escalation routes were in place amd that
there was the facility to resolve this issue. .

3.5 Dave Miller said that there was a paper available on the unresolved differences and
that he would get a copy to Vince Gaskell and Peter Crahan.

AP 4.1.0) : 7
Dave Miller to provide a note of the outstanding issues and differences in the
Detailed Testing Requirements for Vince Gaskell and Peter Crahan.

3.6 The installation schedules are currently being examined and an assessment made of -
sub-contractor capability. .

‘ Acceptance

3.7 Dave Miller reported that after a review of sponsor and supplier expectations, there
was still much work to do to obtain clarity of understanding ‘which was acceptable
to all parties. Acceptance had been an on-going process for some time (in terms of
producing acceptance specifications) there was no ‘top down! strategic framework
on which to base it. The Board made it clear that the issue of what constituted
acceptance needed resolving quickly and it should not be left to the end of the

“process. A further update on this issue will be provided in the next Horizon
Director's Report to the Board. .

Input into CAPS Programme Board Report
for Meeting on 10 July 1998

1) — Programme Overview

The major focus of the Programme at the current time continues to be:

+ supporting the existing live systems

+ brokering and obtaining agreement to the way ahead for the Release 2
replan

+ monitoring the delivery of ICL Pathway’s Release 2 and future releases

2) Live Operations
The current Release continues to provide a Benefit Payment Service and Order
Book Control System for Child Benefit Payments in 204 outlets (119 in the
South West & South Wales Region and 85 in the North East Region). From
an operational point of view, there are no major threats to business continuity.

During May, there were approximately 60,000 encashments (including foreign
encashments) with a total value in excess of £2 m.

However there are concems that current levels of lost transactions (at 4 per I
10,000 encashments), although presently manageable, may not be acceptable Kapr fn
to POCL when large volumes of encashments are returned by newly

automating post offices. Reducing the level of lost transactions therefore hw B nbkn
remains a prime focus for POCL Service Management. The Priority Level 1 .

assigned to these problems is focusing the Contractor towards activity ial G
addressing POCL concerns and providing remedial action fanety Lie.

The Horizon Service Management Team continues to produce a monthly
Service Report which includes service performance reports and operational
issues / threats. The latest report was issued on 30 June.

3) Progress against the Master Plan and Integrated Programme Plan
The Programme Master Plan (MP version 4) and Integrated Plan (IPP version
1) will be updated following the agreement to the Release 2 replan. Based on
the dates quoted (current versions) the following strategic and high level
milestones should have been, or were, achieved during June:

Current Status
Planning
Pathway formally issued Version 4.0 of their high level plan at the Checkpoint
Meeting held on 30 June. It shows a software delivery date (following model
office testing) of 18 December 1998. This reflects progress on the replan
exercise but not the final position.

Testing

System Testing and Business Integration Testing continue to progress. DIT 2
started on schedule on 16 June and is progressing well. It is on schedule to
complete 8 July.

There are some concerns and issues that need to be resolved if End to End and
Model Office testing are to start on 3 and 10 August respectively (see Issues /
Risks section below). —

Release Management

At the FMR meeting on the 18 June it was confirmed that the Benefits Agency

could not support the previously agreed durations for Model Office and End to

End testing in the Testing Strategy given the risks they now perceived in the

assumptions that were being used in estimating these activities. CAPS

proposed a revised approach (option 1) which would result in the completion
of Model Office testing at the end of March 1999 compared to the previous
target date of mid December 1998. The Horizon Programme was not content

with the delay this would cause to the Live Trial and Roll-out and proposed, in ,

outline, an alternative approach (option 2). This splits Model Office testing

into two stages:

+ aphase from August to December 1998 which would test Release 2 against
CAPS 3.0 with Child Benefit only, enabling a single benefit trial from
February 1999.

+ aphase from approximately January / February to May / June which would
test Release 2 against multi benefits, followed by roll-out.

Whilst recognising that this option had significant contractual / commercial

6 implications it was agreed that Horizon and BA / CAPS staff should explore
the two options further. Discussions are ongoing and an update will be
provided at the Board meeting (on 10 July).

Acceptance
The review of the Acceptance Process is. complete and a report has been
produced and issued to the Programme Director and management team. The
recommendations within the report are being considered and will be
implemented in the light of the outcome of the replan and the Treasury

Manager within BA. th ‘ TN Q .

Implementation

The strategy has been agreed, but there remain some detailed issues to be
finalised following agreement to the replan.
