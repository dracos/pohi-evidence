Thanks Tony and thanks for sticking with it!

A rough plan from here:

1. If you could finish your final thoughts tomorrow morning and drop me a line to confirm before midday
that would be great. I'm seeing POL at midday. We'll then take over finishing the Defence.

2. We'll chase down the last few factual confirmations from FJ, Deloitte and POL.

3. I'm going to do a review on Friday before releasing to GC Jane.

4. On Monday we'll sort out the cross refs. Most are obvious but we might need to check with you on some.
We'll also proof read.

5. Jane signs at 9am Tuesday.

Dear all,

At times today, this pleading felt like it would never stop, but I have finally got to the end. The internal para
refs are going to be a nightmare and now all the threads have been pulled together it needs a final proper read
through. But I am too frazzled to worry about these things tonight.

Best wishes,

Tony

Dear Amy,

As discussed just now. I have got to para 69 and I have not proof read or spellchecked anything.

Dear all,

As discussed just now, here is where I have got to with the Defence (page 18). The summary includes
Owain’s comments too.

Tracking the changes to this draft can sometimes cause difficulties, so please let me know if you are happy
for me not to do so.

Best wishes,

Tony
