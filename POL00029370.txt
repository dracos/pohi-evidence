1. Introduction

From the Business Efficiency Programme a secondary programme has evolved called the Back Office
Efficiency programme. It will help forward:five2eleven by realising P&BA’s vision. The BOEP vision is
to develop, deploy and embed “one touch” accounting with minimal intervention for branches, P&BA and
Clients. This will be achieved by introducing modern product design principles as standard POL terms of
business, that are consistently deployed, with slick data feeds” and offer robust controls.

This document details the triggers that lead to the creation, the different types of and the parameters
around Transaction Corrections. Using this information the weaknesses within P&BA processing and
management of Transaction Corrections are documented.

1.1 Methodology

Interviews were held with P&BA team leaders and experts in the areas where Transaction Corrections
are created and managed.

Reviews and feasibilities for products were used for reference to assist with understanding. These
included Client Interface, Cheques, Camelot and ATM reviews along with the POLFS Matching Routines
document.

Data containing information for Transaction Corrections sent to Horizon was also analysed.

2. The Current Process
2.1 The Triggers that lead to Transaction Correction Creation

2.1.1 Transaction Corrections resulting from POLFS generating Open Items

When a transaction is carried out at the Branch through Horizon the electronic data is interfaced into
POLFS. Each product has a specific table within POLFS called GL accounts. Many of these transactions
have a system external to Horizon in the branch where the customer transaction takes place, e.g. ATM
machines and Camelot terminals. In the case of Cheques and manual banking transactions a physical item
is sent to be processed by an external company, e.g. EDS. This data is interfaced or uploaded into
POLFS. Every night POLFS runs a series of routines that take all this data and matches up the Horizon
transaction to the client data in the various GL accounts. Part of the role of the P&BA teams is to look
at items that haven’t matched called an open item and to take corrective action. Where an open item is
found to be a branch error a Transaction Correction is created in POLFS and sent to the branch via
Horizon to correct the error.

The other type of Transaction Correction is when the product team receive a request to create a
Transaction Correction for the branch to correct an error found. These requests can come from the
Client, the Cash Centres or the Branch itself via the NBSC helpline. For many of the teams who raise this
type of Transaction Correction they are able to create a spreadsheet for many branches with the details
needed and upload this into POLFS instead of creating the Transaction Corrections branch by branch.

Historically P&BA introduced a minimum value error limit as a balance against the volume of errors and
head count reduction to prevent products going into a backlog situation. The values were determined by
volume and net value rather than a more scientific analysis at branch level. There are two types of error
limits, a manual limit which is imposed by the processing team and a limit written into the matching
routine. Any errors found below the error limit is moved into a write off GL account for each product
and written off at the end of the financial year.

2.2 After the Transaction Correction has been issued

2.2.1 Failed Transaction Corrections
The reporting and Analysis team receive a weekly file from Fujitsu that details all the Transaction
Corrections sent from POLFS to Horizon. This report shows the status of each Transaction Correction.
On a monthly basis this data is used to create a report of all the Transaction Corrections that are not
resolved. Reasons why a Transaction Correction are rejected by Horizon or don’t get through the

interface are:-

Page 5 of 16

Transaction Correction Review V1.0
POL00029370
POL00029370

¢ The Branch is closed. When it is decided to close a branch the details are sent to the Reference
data team in the form of the OBC22 process. All branches when first closed are categorised as a
C2 on the form this means temporary closed, until Fujitsu and Network Change decide that the
branch will be permanently closed, a C1 category. The Reason why POLFS can still issue
Transaction Corrections to a category C2 branch is because the temporary status does not feed
through. Closed branch Transaction Corrections are transferred to the manual TP6 process and
becomes part of the Former Agents debt team processes.

e The value of the Transaction Correction is not within parameters of product. As part of the
reference data for each product within Horizon there a parameters which dictate the value and
multiples of that value of the product, e.g. £5 scratch cards can only be in multiples of 5. These
parameters are also applied to Transaction Corrections coming through to Horizon.

© The product is not valid. This is a reference data issue where the flag to allow Transaction
Correct mode for that product in POLFS has not checked.

e Crowns settled centrally. Only single agent branches should be allowed to settle a Transaction
Correction centrally, which means deferring payment, but occasionally a Crown Office will do
this.

¢ The wrong flag is chosen when creating the Transaction Correction. When a Transaction
Correction is created it is assigned a flag of N meaning new or E meaning evidence has been
provided. There is also an H and W flag. The H flag means on hold and if this is picked the
Transaction Correction will not be sent to Horizon and will stay in the system. The W flag
represents the ‘blocked’ or disputed Transaction corrections that originally had an N flag.

© Horizon allows branch to roll over to next trading period without accepting all Transaction
Corrections. There is an anomaly in Horizon that when a multi terminal branch has two or more
terminals completing a transaction simultaneously the branch is able to roll over to the next
trading period without accepting all the Transaction Corrections. This is not a widely know or
occurring problem.

2.2.2 Non conformance and Branch investigation

The Fraud and Conformance team purpose is to look for high value Transaction Corrections and for

patterns of errors that may mean the branch is being fraudulent or needs extra help to understand

particular transactions that it is persistently non -conforming. The P&BA settlement teams will escalate

branches and some further investigation will be done. In some cases the conformance team will escalate a
Page 6 of 16 Transaction Correction Review V1.0
POL00029370
POL00029370

branch to the field support team and request a special audit. The reason behind the top 20 worst loss
incurring Crown offices will be investigated and reported to the Crowns Senior Finance Manager,
Finance Analysts (BDM Area 1 & 2), Compliance Risk Reporting, and Finance Reporting Officer. The
conformance team are constrained to investigate only the top 20 branches due to the complexity of the
investigations and level of resource within the team. The work this team undertakes adds value by
preventing further loss through non conformance and prevention fraud.

2.2.3 Blocking transaction corrections

Blocking a Transaction Correction is when a postmaster disputes that the discrepancy is the branch error
and whilst the dispute is investigated further a flag is applied to the Transaction Correction to stop any
further action being taken e.g. chasing the postmaster to pay the discrepancy amount. A Transaction
Correction that has had evidence provided and hence an E flag against it cannot be blocked unless it is
settled centrally first. This means that the majority of blocked Transaction Corrections have been closed
in the original GL account associated with the product and sit in the settle centrally GL which is either the
responsibility of the current or multiple agents’ debt teams. The way blocked Transaction Corrections
are managed differ depending on where they sit. W flagged blocked Transaction Corrections are picked
up by the Reporting and Analysis team and reported to the product team leader to close. Single agent
blocked Transaction Corrections that end up in the current agents’ debt GL are reported to the product
team leaders to investigate and close. Blocked Transaction Corrections for multiple agents are picked up
and investigated by the Conformance and Branch Investigation team. The reason for this is because the
team has a good working relationship with the branches head office.

2.2.4 Crowns

All debit transaction corrections are a loss to POL unless the contra credit or branch discrepancy is also
found. There is no distinction between the differing Branch types at investigation and creation level.
Once in Horizon the branch type depends on what the branch manger can do with the error. Crowns
have to accept Transaction Corrections into their Losses and Gains ledger which is reported monthly to
their Regional Support Advisors. The Crown Losses Review details the issues around Crown losses and
the relationships with Crown Account Manager and Regional Support Advisors.

2.2.5 Multiple and Single agent Branches

When a Transaction Correction is received by a Multiple agent branch they can either make good, which
means they will take out the value of credit or replace the debit into the holdings themselves or they can
assign to nominee, this means that a statement will be sent to the head office of the multiple agent, e.g.
MacColls who will settle all the outstanding amounts for it’s branches then deal with the branch
accordingly. Once assigned to nominee the value of the Transaction Correction sits in the multiple
agent’s debt team GL accounts to manage. More details of the process to produce statements and
manage to debt can be found in the Multiple Agents Debt Review.

Page 7 of 16 Transaction Correction Review V1.0
POL00029370
POL00029370

Single agent branches can also make good a Transaction Correction or if it’s over £150 in value they
have the option to Settle Centrally, this means they defer payment and can roll over into the next trading
period. Once settled centrally the Transaction Correction sits in the Single agent debt GL account to
manage. More details of the process to recover this debt can be found in the Current Agents Debt
Review

2.2.6 High Value Transaction Correction Authorisation Signature Requirement

As part of the Transaction Correction creation process a high value authorisation series of signatures has
been introduced. This is a form that goes with the evidence and is signed by the level of manager dictated
by the value. Between £10k and £29.99K the team leaders’ signature, £30K to £49.99K Senior mangers
signature and over £50K requires the head of P&BA to sign. These forms are then filed with the
paperwork. The reason for creating this extra check step was two fold; firstly to prevent large credit
Transaction Corrections being issued , then a long period for the debit to be issued, which then might get
disputed and blocked. The second reason being to ensure that branches are not hit by a large value
Transaction Correction which is subsequently found to not be proper to that branch.

3 Conclusions and Recommendations

3.1 Investigation and Creating Transaction Corrections

There are several ways to create a Transaction Correction in POLFS.

The manual option is used by teams that don’t raise many Transaction Corrections. These teams
spend time investigation errors and enquiries that don’t result in a Transaction Correction.

The automated option creates Transaction Correction individually but carries data across into fields
from the original open item.

Teams that are driven by requested Transaction Corrections are able to use a spreadsheet to upload
bulk branch details. This saves time and effort.

e Recommendation 1 — Conduct a feasibility to look at an all encompassing issues logging system
for P&BA.

e Benefit — Reduced input time into POLFS, increased accuracy and automation of text sent
to branches and so a consistent, professional approach and image. Visibility of all work
that P&BA teams are involved in that doesn’t end in a Transaction Correction. Better
audit trail of information if the Transaction Correction is disputed by the branch.

Camelot uses a process of rolling up or amalgamating all errors incurred by a branch over a period
and issues one Transaction Correction to the branch. They send a spreadsheet with details of the
errors to the branches to help them reconcile with there paperwork. This is not a popular method and
there is a feeling that branches find it difficult to understand the evidence.

The reason for using this method is because there are too many errors to handle on an individual
basis without doubling the resource requirement or getting into a backlog situation.

¢ Recommendation 2a — For all instances of Camelot errors sent to branches make the evidence
clearer to aid consistency.
e Recommendation 2b —When Ping has been introduced and errors reduced for Camelot, re- visit
the process and consider going back to handling errors on an individual basis
e Benefit - Less complaints from branches and better working relationship with the network

POL00029370

« Recommendation 3 — Present a Change Proposal Document and Business Case to illustrate that
deploying additional agency resource to investigate errors within the maintained error limit, write
off values for the impacted products would be reduced.

«Benefit - The value in the write off accounts for maintained error 09/10 up to period 9 was
£422K*. If additional agency staff were employed for a limited period of time for the
purpose of investigating and solving these errors, the value recovered is likely to outweigh
the cost of the agency staff and reduce the value written off.

(*minus the cash& currency figure which is not due to maintained error limit)

NB. It is anticipated that BOEP will produce the required CPD and Business Case documentation on
approval of this recommendation.

Fujitsu send a file containing all the Transaction Corrections sent to Horizon, the data shows all the
information the branch received, this includes the text.

Analysis of the Fujitsu file found c2000 Transaction Correction were found to have no contact
number within the text out of 40K issued between August and October 09 which is circa 5%. In
some cases this is because the branches are instructed to address any disputes in writing.

During the analysis of the long text of the Transaction Corrections there were many other issues
which made the task very difficult. E.g. the text I field was very inconsistent in teams approach, some
use a reference number some use the name of the product

¢ Recommendation 4 —On a monthly basis , P&BA Admin Section report back to team leaders the
‘fitness’ of the text within the Fujitsu Services Transaction Correction report, particularly
identifying poorly written and missing information. P&BA team leaders to tackle individuals
when poor Transaction Corrections are created.
= Benefit — Branches will receive meaningful information and have less reason to dispute
errors. Reduce double handling and recovery time.

For some products like ATM and A&L, paperwork evidence is sent to the branch after the
Transaction Correction has been created. Evidence from clients often has to be requested which is
sent in hard copy format by post. Some branches do receive evidence electronically but this is only
done if the branch requests it and is an exception rather than a rule.

« Recommendation 5 — Complete an exercise led by the P&BA Change Team to set up a database
of all branches, including agency postmasters that are willing to receive Transaction Correction
evidence by email instead of by post. This to also include clients that could send data
electronically but don’t currently do so.

= Benefit — The Transaction Correction is clearer to the branch and they don’t have to wait
for paperwork to arrive in the post. A more professional approach. Reduction in business
mail cost, using period 6 data the postage cost for sending postal evidence is c. £1K per
month

The reasons for introducing a management authorisation of high value Transaction Corrections are valid,
the implementation of the process appears to have lost some of the purpose. A more robust process is
needed that ensures the authoriser has checked for contra errors. This is likely to involve changes to
POLFS to achieve this

« Recommendation 6a— The P&BA change team work with P&BA team leaders to re-establish the
current authorisation process with changes that ensure steps are followed and all checks are made
before sign off.

e Recommendation 6b — BOEP to produce a feasibility to help address the issues with the lack of
contra error notification.

= Benefit — Will encourage the right management behaviours and allow cross team
interaction. High value credit Transaction Corrections will not be issued without
consideration to the debit. Branches will not receive high value Transaction Corrections
in error.

3.2 After the Transaction Correction has been issued

During the review it became apparent that because the majority of blocked Transaction Corrections
are sitting in the Debt teams GL accounts it was the belief that the responsibility to manage and close
them sat with the debt team leaders.
e¢ Recommendation 7 — Include within the Process Management Working Group a robust process
that ensures those accountable and responsible for resolving the disputed Transaction corrections
are measured and seen to be taking action.
= Benefit — Reduce the time taken to resolve disputes and demonstrate a professional
process to branches so Transaction Correction are not forgotten about. In period 9 09/10
£599K of blocked Transaction Corrections was sitting in the debt GL accounts, £142K of
this was over 91 days old.

POL00029370

The Conformance and Fraud team look for branch debit or credit Transaction Corrections that cancel
each other out, i.e. contra. These might have been created by different teams and be in different
weeks due to the different timescales the products operate at. There are sometimes instances where a
branch will make good a credit and take the cash out of the holdings but will settle centrally the debit
and owe POL. An authorisation process was introduced to prevent high value Transaction
Corrections being sent without the contra as detailed in recommendation 6 above.

The Conformance team provide value in identifying potentially fraudulent branches and persistent non
conformance offenders. As long as a team exists that’s purpose is to investigate Transaction
Corrections once created the vision for One Touch Accounting will never be realised.

The over riding weakness is the feeling that the teams are working in ‘silos’. The product team’s
priority is to clear there GL’s and then have other teams picking up Branch issues.

Following on from the introduction of HNG later in 2010, there are planned developments such as
Ping that will improve counter processes and data inputs into POLFS. This in turn will reduce the
number of errors and improve the settlement process. Work has begun to address some of the ways
of working issues. A Skills Matrix has been established; development of a P&BA Process Summary;
establishment of Process Management Working Groups — see appendix 2 the draft Terms of
Reference for Process Management.

The work on process management is a move in the right direction. The Terms of Reference is
looking for cross team working and a cultural changes as well as documented processes with owners
and best practice. However, there is a lack of how this will be measured and progress reported.

e Recommendation 8 — Develop and implement measures that demonstrate the process management
improvements are making the right changes that positively impact internally and associated
external processes

= Benefit — P&BA will be able to demonstrate that the process management working groups
are effective. Better relationships internally, no more working in ‘silos’, less frustration
and better working with branches to resolve issues. Reduce double handling of
information, identify problem branches quicker and reduce the number of Transaction
Corrections issued. Problem branches identified earlier and so prevent higher losses and
fraud.

When an agent branch receives a Transaction Correction there are 2 options how to resolve it. The
make good option means that the branch is agreeing to accept the error and they will either take the
surplus out of the holdings or put a loss back in. Transaction Corrections under £150 have to be
made good. The only way of knowing if a branch has been putting the cash back is when a field
support manager conducts and audit on the branch.

Ifa Transaction Correction is over £150, single agent branches have the option of Settling centrally,
this allows the branch to roll over into the next accounting period but they can the pay the debt by
debit/ credit card, cheque or arrange to have small amount deducted from their monthly pay.

e Recommendation 9 —Undertake a feasibility to ascertain the benefits of making Agency branches
settle centrally for all (with a possible lower value limit) Transaction Corrections. The feasibility
also to consider reduction of the current limit from £150. To prevent increased resource in the
debt teams, the feasibility would have to include branch payment method options, e.g. direct
debits.

© NB. This recommendation compliments the recommendations made in the Current Agents Debt
Reviews to better manage repayment plans

POL00029370

Benefit — When a branch makes good a Transaction Correction there is no evidence that
the loss has been returned to POL. A branch could get into a position of owing POL a
large amount and lose their branch if the field support team discover deliberate fraud. By
settling Centrally POL knows it has recovered the loss and cases of fraud would be visible
earlier and levels of former agents’ debt reduced. Reduction in the costs of the Field
Support and P&BA conformance teams.
