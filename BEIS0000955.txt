Please find attached a Quarterly Update prepared by UKGI colleagues accompanied by a briefing for the Permanent
Secretary in advance of his meeting with Nick Read on Monday 30". You may wish to also flag to the Permanent
Secretary that whilst on senior bonuses we are waiting for a formal response from Remco, any discretion in future
payments would likely come into effect from 20/21 for STIP and 2020/23 for LTIP (as set out in paragraph 5 of the
QU).

Please do let us know if you have any follow up questions.

Kind regards
