Dear Kevin

On behalf of George, please find attached documentation received from Ronnie Campbell MP (for Blyth
Valley) on behalf of one of his constituents. We do not have access to the requisite information and
would therefore request that Post Office Limited provide a full report on the whole scenario as soon as

possible. We would also request that a copy is provided to Ronnie Campbell please.

Regards
Sharon
