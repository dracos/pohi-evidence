Rods initial response to the questions posed by SS regarding Branch Accounting ability to access branch data.

I'll forward his second email which is an old update and one you may have already seen.

Steve, to answer these questions please see this and my next email too.

As regards the words “...finance teams can no longer adjust client accounts on site...” ~ “On site” meant “on site in
Chesterfield P&BA” not “on site in branch”.

As Alan suggests, we have indeed responded to this in a previous enquiry — please see the first part of my response in
the next email I send you tonight.

That largely answers the specific series of questions below too. However, please see my updates below in bold (below
each question)

1. whether, before December 2006, any POL employees were able to input transactions directly into branch accounts...
and if so,,,

No — not into a branches accounts. See next email

2. whether - and when and how - SPMRs/Branch staff were informed whenever such interventions occurred
N/A - See next email

3. where POL staff having that capability were based
No such capability

4. what transaction types were involved and, lastly...
No such capability

5. what User IDs were applied to the transactions so executed.
No such capability

Gareth has pointed out there was never an option to manipulate Branch accounts through Horizon. The description of
the process that was in place should be available from PE&BA (FSC).

Hope this is OK.

Pete,

There was never any capability for POL Staff to manipulate the Branch accounts through Horizon. I think the Ops
Manual is badly written.

ido remember the introduction of TCs in 2006 (1 was the Architect responsible for this as part of the IMPACT.
programme). What used to happen before that is that the Branch was sent a piece of paper called an Error Notice. This
would then instruct them to carry out some specific transaction at the Branch. These were often ignored. The whole
point of TCs was to simplify and speed up the process and enforce conformance.

POL-0098202

POL00098619

There may also have been a mechanism by which POL could manipulate the branch accounts in their old accounting
system ({CBDB — owned and operated by POL or CSC on their behalf), but I never had any real understanding of that
system.

Therefore I think this is yet another red herring!

Gareth

Can you remember this change as it looks like prior to the introduction of POLSAP PO staff were able to make changes to
a branches account on site.

fl assume this should have been more specific about PO staff making changes to the central record of the branch balance
and not affecting any of the transactions.

Hi Pete

I think Ron’s further questions below are — like the majority list of 26 we saw at the meeting earlier this week — covered
by the fact that there was no access to live systems from the test area.

Could you however take a look at the operations manual statement attached and Alan Bates reference to “finance

teams can no longer adjust client accounts on site”. Could you provide some clarity/context around that statement?

Thanks
Steve

Simon/Steve:
Alan Bates is asking a question here that is pretty similar to one of our set of 26.

It is inferred, in the first para of the attached section of POL's Operations Manual, that POL finance people had been
able, until December 2006, to access branch accounts directly (presumably to process TCs). Could you please clarify:

1. whether, before December 2006, any POL employees were able to input transactions directly into branch accounts...
and if so,,,

2. whether - and when and how - SPMRs/Branch staff were informed whenever such interventions occurred
3. where POL staff having that capability were based
4. what transaction types were involved and, lastly...

5. what User IDs were applied to the transactions so executed.

Ron, re SROOS, quite some time ago I sent you through a scan from a POL SPMR operations manual, copy
attached. With regard to external access to a SPMR’s data, it might be worth obtaining clarification from
POL about what the first paragraph of section 7 of the attached scan meant where they state “finance
teams can no longer adjust client accounts on site”. Did that mean that they could before the date of
the document and what that actually related to, by whom and from where?

You may have already have covered this point with POL but otherwise it may have some bearing on
SROOS or associated issues.

Alan
