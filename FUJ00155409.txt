Hi Steve

To update you - Dave Posnett rang me yesterday to ask status of this exercise (which he was including in his
internal reporting). I told him it was still WIP and that we were hoping for results later this week/early next
week. Do you know when Anne will be able to review?

Also, do you know status of the CP?

Kind regards
Penny
