Rachael,

Attached is my initial response to the Defence Case Statement you sent me.

I don’t think there is anything in it that could be added to the statement (but you may disagree}. I also note that this is
dated August 2012 and so was produced some time before my Statement. Is there any later statement I need to look

at?

As I said yesterday, ’ll be out of the Office all of next week, but may pick up emails in the evenings, so won’t be able to
do much more until the 11"" Feb.

Hi Gareth

POL00089427
POL00089427

The week of the 11th Feb will be fine for Ishaq. Both Wylie and Patel are still listed for the dates that you have referred to

in your email.

I will ask my collegue Andy Bolc to let you know what was said in the Grant Allen as I don't have that information to hand,
but he can update you on that. I will let you know if there are any changes to dates for the cases that you have provided

reports on
Thank you for your assistance, I will be in touch.
Kind regards

Rachael

Rachael,

I'm fine thanks. Hope you are too.

Thanks for the update. I'll make a note of the dates. No problem with them at present.

V'll have a look at the Ishaq stuff and get back to you. When do you need anything? [I’m tied up all of next week so I may
th

not be able to get anything formalised until the week of 11°" Feb. Is that OK?

What exactly was the conclusion of the Grant Allen case? I was particularly concerned about his allegations regarding
the problems caused due to refurbishment and comms issues being the reason for some of his losses. Was anything said
publically about any of that? We were quite concerned that this might set a precedent.

lalso have Patel pencilled in for week of 25/2 and Kim Wylie for week of 4° March. Are these still on?

Subject: Horizon cases

Hi Gareth
Hope you are well. Just to let you know where we are with a couple of cases.
Grant Allen - this case has concluded now so you will not need to attend.

Ishaq - Having served your report, the defence have queried it and are claiming that Ishaq had to
make false entries in order for the figures to reconcile, as the Horizon system kept malfunctioning.

The trial is listed for the 25th February 2013 for 3-4 days. Please could you make a note in your diary,
as you will be needed to attend to clarify our position with Horizon.

Our barrister has asked if you could read the Defence case statement attached and make a list of your
initial thoughts on the assertions that he is making. We may need you to add a few of those
comments into your report so that each issue is addressed.

Ihave attached a copy of the case summary for your assistance.

Sefton & Nield - This trial is listed for week commencing 22 April 2013, but it may start on the 18
April 2013, please could you pencil in your diary to attend court for the two weeks beginning
15/4/13.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further information.

Kind regards

Rachael
