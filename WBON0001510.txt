I refer to your client's application dated 15 March 2019 and my letter to you of the
same date.

We have undertaken an urgent search of our records for audit reports relating to the
Horizon system and identified four such documents, being reports prepared by Ernst
& Young dated: 7 May 2008; 28 March 2010; 19 October 2010; and 13 May 2011.

Attached are the relevant excerpts from these reports. Where the pages include
irrelevant material, this has been redacted.

If we can assist the Court further with this matter, please let me know.
