Patrick,
With apologies for the delay, I attach four advice notes received from Brian Altman QC:
1. “Interim Review of CK’s Current Review Process” dated 2 August 2013, which advised on the approach being

adopted to reviewing past prosecutions (in particular POL’s duty of disclosure) following publication of Second
Sight’s July 2013 Report;

2. “General Review” dated 15 October 2013, which focussed on POL’s past prosecution practices;

3. “Review of Post Office Ltd Prosecution Role” dated 31 October 2013, which made recommendations about
how POL might prosecute going forward; and

4. “Advice on Suggested Approach to Criminal Case Mediation” dated 5 September 2014, whch advised on Tony
Hooper’s suggested approaches to mediating criminal cases in the Scheme.

Kind regards, Rod

Hi Rod
Hope all ok with you.
You were going to send me BAQC’s reports — would you mind when you get a chance ?

Cheers
