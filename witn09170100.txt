                                                      Witness Name: GLEN MORRIS


                                                       Statement No: WITNO9170100


                                                               Dated: 02 October 2023




                        POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




                 FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF GLEN MORRIS



I, Glen Morris will say as follows:


    1. I am a current employee of the Post Office and I hold the position of `Branch

       Assurance Advisor.' A previous job title for this position within the Post Office

       was `Audit Inspector.'



    2. This statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon Inquiry (the "Inquiry")

        with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 17 August 2023 (the

       "Request"). The Request contains 58 questions, which I have addressed

        below. I would like to flag that I have received legal assistance to produce this

        statement from my solicitor, Mr Ian Manners of Ashfords LLP_ When seeking

        to obtain assistance from Ashfords LLP, I was assisted by the Post Office with

        the initial stage of confirming the availability of insurance coverage, to cover

        the associated legal costs.

                                                                                  WITN09170100




3. I would like to note that the questions posed in the Request mainly centre

   around the case of David Blakey, the events of which occurred almost 20 years

   ago. It has therefore been difficult for me to recall precise details at times, due

   to the passage of time. However, I have made this statement to the best of my

   recollection and I have ensured to make it clear in instances where I cannot

   remember something, or I have had to rely on a document provided.



  Relevant backaround

4. I have been asked to set out a summary of my career and qualifications. I

   started my career in the Post Office in 1983 at the age of 18, working on the

   counter at Worksop. I stayed in this role for approximately 6 years until 1989,

   following which I went on 'Leave Reserve'. When on `Leave Reserve' I was

   posted in various Post Office roles in the Sheffield and Rotherham area. The

   specific locations depended on where cover was required. For example, I

   would be working in the return letter branch one week, within the finance team

   the following week, a branch counter the next week etc. I cannot remember

   what specific locations I worked at on a week by week basis during this period

   as it changed constantly.



5. Around January 1995 I interviewed internally with the Post Office to become

   an Audit Inspector. By this point I had worked under the Post Office umbrella

   for 12 years and I had gained a lot of knowledge and experience of various

   Post Office procedures. I was successful in obtaining the role and started my

   Auditor career in February 1995. At the time of writing this statement I am still

   currently employed in an Auditor position for the Post Office and I have

   remained at the same level throughout.

                                                                                    WITNO9170100
                                                                                  WITN09170100




6. When I first became an Audit Inspector I was based in the Sheffield and

   Rotherham area, along with 6 other Auditors. Due to the diminishing number

   of Audit Inspectors employed by the Post Office over the years, the areas that

   I am scheduled to cover has expanded over time. I am now considered to be

   part of the `North team' covering mainly areas within the North of England.

   However, sometimes I will be scheduled to carry out audits in branches that

   fall outside of this remit, including branches within Ireland, Scotland etc.



7. In terms of gaining the relevant training and experience, back when I first

   became and Audit Inspector it was very much the case that you learned on the

   job. I initially shadowed more experienced Auditors and assisted them with

   carrying out scheduled audits. During that time audits were carried out at

   branches almost every day, so I was able to gain the necessary skills and

   experience quite quickly by shadowing more experienced Auditors. Whilst I

   cannot remember precisely how I progressed from this shadowing role, I

   believe that it is likely that after a few months my line manager at the time would

   have received confirmation from the relevant colleagues that I had become

   experienced enough to lead audits myself. I have had various line managers

   over the years, so I cannot recall who this particular line manager would have

   been.



8. I have been asked to set out what I understood the role of an Audit Inspector

   to involve. Essentially, the core of the Audit Inspector role has remained

   unchanged since I started and it involves carrying out asset verification. What

   this means is that we count all cash and stock at a Post Office branch to check



                                  Page 3 of 32
                                                                                WITNO9170100
                                                                              WITNO9170100




   whether the amount that should be present at the branch is there. We also

   carry out compliance checks, which mainly involves checking that the required

   security measures are in place at the branch. There are a number of different

   types of audit. The main ones are:



      a. transfer audits - carried out when a new Subpostmaster (hereafter

         referred to as "SPM") takes over a branch to verify that the cash and

         stock being transferred matches central records.

      b. closure audits - verifying that the assets being returned when a branch

         closes matches what should be present at the branch.

      c. risk audits â€” verifying assets where a potential risk such as excess cash

         holdings is flagged.

      d. robbery audits - verifying the remaining cash and stock to establish the

         amount of cash and stock stolen from a branch.



9. When I first became an Audit Inspector, the Horizon IT system had not yet been

   implemented. Therefore, in order to complete an audit we would be required to

   work back manually to the to the previous week's balance (adding receiptsand

   subtracting payments) to establish what assets should be present. This was

   then compared to the actual assets on site. This involved working off hand

   written paper records.



10. Since the introduction of the Horizon IT system, we no longer work off paper

   records to determine what cash and stock should exist within a branch. Instead,

   printouts are obtained via the Horizon system which include an printed


                                Page 4 of 32
                                                                                       WITNO9170100
                                                                                     WITN09170100




      reports from each stock unit_ At the time of the matter involving David Blakey,

      I believe the Horizon IT system had been in place for approximately 4 years.



   11.Once an audit is complete, I report the findings in an audit report to the Retail

      Line Manager. If any major discrepancies or shortfalls are discovered, I would

      also report my findings to my Senior Auditor and Investigation/Security team.

      At the time of the incident involving David Blakey, Craig Thompson was my

      Senior Auditor, the Retail Line Manger was Jayne Kaye and the security team

      contact was Paul Whitaker.



   12. 1 have been asked my views on the competence and professionalism of my

      colleagues and managers. Throughout my career, I believe that my colleagues

      and managers have been exceptionally professional and competent. Being an

      Audit Inspector is a sought after position and I believe that you need a high

      level of integrity and professionalism from the outset to be employed and

      remain within the role. As far as I am concerned, the people I have worked with

      have been highly competent and professional at all times and I would not have

      stayed within an audit role for 28 years if I did not believe that to be the case.




The audit process and the policies/practices in place

   13. Since I became an Audit Inspector in February 1995 there have been many

      changes to the audit process and the policies and practices that relate to it. I

      cannot remember every single change, nor the specific dates that such

      changes were implemented as it is ever evolving. However, despite the



                                     Page 5 of 32
                                                                                  WITNO9170100
                                                                                WITNO9170100




   number of changes that will have occurred over the past 28 years, the core of

   the auditing process has remained the same. As it was back when I started,

   the primary objective involves asset verification of stock and cash at branches,

   the process of which I have set out in paragraph 8 above.



14.In terms of major changes to the processes, practices and policies, the

   introduction of the Horizon IT system in around 2000 was considered a

   significant development as it allowed the audit to utilise electronic records and

   move away from a manual process.



15.Another significant change to the practice was the move from unannounced to

   announced audits. When I first started my Auditor career, we would be

   scheduled in to complete an audit at a particular branch and the branch would

   have no knowledge of the visit. We would arrive first thing in the morning before

   the branch opened and would explain to the postmaster why we were attending

   and we would ask for access to all the cash and stock within the branch. We

   would then complete the asset verification process. Nowadays, audit visits are

   announced, but I cannot remember when this change was introduced.



16. Additionally, when I first became an Audit Inspector I believe that every post

   office in the country would undergo an audit every two years at least. This is

   not the case today as audit frequency is now based on an assessment of risk.

   Again, I am unable to pinpoint the exact time that this change came into place.

                                                                                   WITNO9170100




Recruitment and training of auditors


   17. I have been asked to consider the following documents:

         a. "Assurance Review - Recruitment (Vetting & Training)" (version 1.0, 27

              October 2009) (POL00032698);

         b. "Network    auditing   approach,    methods    and    assurance"    (2013)

              (POL00086765);

         c. "Training & Audit Advisor" (undated) (POL00088453);

         d. "Audit Advisor" (undated) (POL00088557).



   18.These are not documents I am familiar with and prior to receiving them from

      the Inquiry, I cannot recall having had sight of them.



   19. From my own knowledge, I am not aware if there are a variety of potential

      routes by which you can be recruited as an Auditor for the Post Office_ I have

      always thought that you could only be recruited internally and only if you have

      some counter experience, as some balancing experience is required.



   20_ In terms of the level of qualification and/or experience required I do not think

      there was a specified minimum level required at the time I was recruited. You

      just needed to have at least some counter experience to be considered for the

      role.


   21. When I was recruited as an Audit Inspector in 1995, I do not recall undergoing

      a formal induction as such. Rather, I learned on the job by shadowing more

      experienced colleagues, as I have described in paragraph 7 above.

                                    Page 7 of 32
                                                                                        WITN09170100
                                                                                      WITNO9170100




   22. In terms of ongoing training, I do not recall any formal training days in the early

      years of my Auditor career. The Audit Team would simply receive updates on

      process changes as and when they occurred and I believe that this was

      sufficient to ensure we understood what was required of us. Training has

      become more formalised as the years have gone by.



   23.1 believe that from the time I became an Audit Inspector to the present day,

      auditors have always had the necessary training and experience required to

      carry out their roles at the Post Office.



The planning and scheduling of audits


   24.1 have been asked to consider the document "Audit Plan & Scheduling, Chapter

      1 of the Audit Process Manual" (Version 8.0) (2010) (POL00084650). Again,

      this is not a document I am familiar with and I have only considered it for the

      first time when it was provided to me by the Inquiry.



   25. From my recollection, when I first became an Audit Inspector all branches were

      audited every two years at random, however, at some point in time the

      scheduling process became more risk based. I do not know when random

      audits were changed in favour of risk based audits, but there is now a network

      monitoring team in place which identifies issues and raises red flags to trigger

      an audit.




                                      Page 8 of 32
                                                                                    WITNO9170100
                                                                                  WITNO9170100




26_Triggers for scheduling audits include, but are not limited to, robberies, risk,

   branch transfers and branch closures.



27_As alluded to earlier in my statement, I believe that when I first started my

   Auditor career, audits were scheduled on a weekly basis. There was often little

   or no change to the weekly schedule. If on the rare occasion a visit to a branch

   had to be cancelled last minute for any reason (for example, a robbery had

   taken place at another branch which called for an urgent audit), then this could

   easily be rescheduled without liaising with the branch in question, as audits

   were unannounced at that time. As time has gone on and with audits now being

   announced, the schedule has become more advanced and changes occur

   more often.



28.I have never been involved with the organisation or scheduling of audits.



29. 1 have been asked to describe any enquiries or investigations conducted before

   a branch visit is scheduled. It is important for the Inquiry to note that amount of

   work done by an auditor prior to the branch visit has changed over the years.

   From my recollection, early on in my audit career there was little to no enquires

   prior to branch visits.



30. Nowadays information is more readily available and accessible through the

   support and IT systems in place. As such, most potential issues within a branch

   are identified earlier on in the process, meaning that an audit occurs further

   down the line if it is considered to be necessary.

                                                                                 WITNO9170100




   31.1 have been asked to describe and explain any variation between the

      scheduling of audits in respect of Crown Office branches and other branches.

      I know that Crown Office branches undergo further internal audits, which I

      comment briefly upon in paragraph 54 below, but I do not recall what the

      difference is in terms of the frequency of scheduling of audits compared to

      ordinary branches. I cannot comment beyond that as I have never been

      responsible for scheduling any type of audit.



The Auditing Process


   32. I have been asked to consider the following documents:

         a. "Audit Charter" (version 4.0, undated) (POL00083966);

         b_ "Performing a Branch Audit", Chapter 3 of the Audit Process Manual

            (version 5.1, May 2010) (POL00084801);

         c. "Core & Outreach Audit Process", Chapter 3a of the Audit Process

            Manual (version 1.0, 27 May 2011) (POL00085534);

         d. "Follow Up Audit Process", Chapter 3b of the Audit Process Manual

            (version 3.0, May 2015) (POL00087627);

         e. "Performing a Cash Centre Audit", Chapter 7 of the Audit Process

                                                                                   WITNO9170100




      h_ "Condensed Guide for Audit Attendance" (version 2, Oct 2008)

         (POL00084813);

      i. "Requirement of Network Field Support Advisors at audit, following

         discovery of discrepancy" (version 1.0, Oct 2011) (POL00085652);

      j. "Network    auditing    approach,    methods     and    assurance"    (2013)

         (POL00086765);

      k. "Training Guide: Compliance Audit Tool" (Sep 2015) (POL00087688);

      I. "Training-Aide for Branch Asset Checking" (version 1.7, Nov 2014)

         (POL00087716); and

      m. "Terms of Reference Audits" (version 1, April 2015) (POL00087614).



33.1 note that these documents are concerned with various processes and

   practices in place that relate to the Post Office Auditor role. I would like to flag

   that apart from the first document in the list, "Audit Charter" (version 4.0,

   undated) (POL00083966), all other documents appear to postdate the incident

   involving Mr Blakey in 2004. As such, it does not seem that they would have

   been implemented at the time.



34. In relation to the undated document (POL00083966), I cannot recall if this was

   in operation at the time of the audit at Riby Square Branch in May 2004.

   However, I would like to draw attention to section 2.2 of this document, where

   the purpose and scope of the Auditor role is set out as follows:



   "The Primary purpose of branch and cash centre audit activity is to provide a

   independent assurance to Post Office Ltd that.-


                                 Page 11 of 32
                                                                                               WITN09170100
                                                                                           WITNO9170100




      â€¢   Its assets exist at Post OfficeÂ® branches and cash centres

      â€¢                 There is compliance to relevant policies, processes, regulations and


          standards."




35.The first bullet point in this description relates to the Auditor's role of asset

   verification, which I have already set out in in Paragraph 8 above.



36. In terms of the second bullet point relating to compliance checks, I would like

   to flag to the Inquiry that this action is completely separate to the asset

   verification steps taken to complete an audit. Once an audit and the associated

   reporting steps that follow have been completed, Auditors are then required to

   ask the postmaster a checklist of questions which relate to security and

   compliance. These include, but are not limited to, questions about keeping the

   secure area closed, regular checking of security alarms, the level of cash kept

   in safes etc.



37. 1 would also like to draw attention to the following paragraph of section 2.2 of

   document (POL00083966):



   "The role is not an investigative one nor is its primary function to detect fraud.

   The investigation of fraud is the responsibility of Post Office Ltd Security team.

   While it is not a primary function of the audit team to detect fraud, it is not

   uncommon for system control weaknesses to be exploited for fraudulent gain.

   Where auditors identify or suspect fraud, processes exist to escalate the

   matter."

38. This paragraph clarifies that where any discrepancies such as cash shortages

   are found during an audit, it is not for the Audit Team to then further investigate

   matters. Rather, we would be required to report it to the Investigation/Security

   Team, who would then decide whether or not to take any further action. This

   point is relevant to the actions I took in relation to the events that occurred

   during the audit of Riby Square Branch in May 2004, the details of which I have

   addressed later in this statement.



39.The final section of document (POL00083966) I would like to comment on is

   "Section 4 â€”Code of Ethics". Whilst I cannot directly remember this document

   or this specific section I believe that I would have read it at the time it was

   issued and I would have taken on board and understood the points raised in

   relation to the Code of Ethics. In particular, I have always understood the

   importance of confidentiality and conflicts of interest and have ensured to take

   the relevant steps to avoid a breach of such. For example, whenever I have

   been scheduled at a branch where I have previously worked on the counters

   during my Leave Reserve role, I have raised this with my line manager to

   double check that it would be appropriate for me to carry out the audit.



40. In terms of the information that I consider when completing an audit, this

   remains the same on the day of the audit itself, despite what type of audit is

   being undertaken. Essentially, I will consider the findings in the printouts

   retrieved for each stock unit from the Horizon IT system, so the figures can be

   compared to the total figures of all the cash and stock counted during the audit.


                                 Page 13 of 32
                                                                                      WITNO9170100
                                                                                    WITNO9170100




   I will also consider any extra information that a postmaster relays to me on the

   day in relation to any figures. In the matter concerning Mr Blakey, this would

   have been the information he provided regarding the shortfall.



41.The only time where the information I consider varies for different types of

   audits is where background information is obtained prior to going to a branch.

   For example, if a problem with stock at a branch triggers the requirement for

   an audit, I may contact the stock team first to get some background information

   before attending if I think it is necessary. However, I would not necessarily take

   this step when excess cash in a branch triggers the need for an audit. Rather,

   I would potentially review the branch's previous cash declarations and cash

   reports to obtain the relevant background information prior to attending.



42.As touched upon in paragraphs 37 and 38 of this statement, whenever I

   discover a significant shortfall during an audit I will proceed to report this to the

   Investigation/Security Team, as it is for them to then determine what steps to

   take next. Before doing this, I always double check my figures first to make

   sure that the shortfall discovered is correct. I may also consider various

   documents that can be obtained through the Horizon IT system, such as the

   transactions log, to see if a reason for the discrepancy can be identified.

   However, I do not believe that these actions constitute "further investigation" â€”

   they simply represent standard practice in order to verify my findings as part of

   the audit process and in turn this might flag to the Investigation/Security Team

   any information that may be considered helpful when they proceed with their

   own enquiries.

                                                                                  WITNO9170100




43.The point at which I would be prompted to notify the Investigation/Security

   Team of a discrepancy differs depending on the circumstances. For example,

   if I am told at the outset by a postmaster that a large cash shortfall is likely to

   be discovered, as was the case involving Mr Blakey, then I will report this to

   the Investigation/Security Team immediately and will further confirm the

   specific figure once the audit is complete. However, if there is no admission by

   the postmaster prior to the audit and a large cash shortfall is only discovered

   after it is complete, I would first double check with the postmaster whether there

   is any other cash or stock that the Audit Team have not been given access to,

   and if not, I would then contact the Investigation/Security Team at this stage.



44. 1 would like to point out to the Inquiry that as well as contacting the

   Investigation/Security Team, I will also separately inform the Retail Line

   Manager and the Audit Manager when any large shortfalls are discovered, to

   make sure that all necessary people who require the information receive it.



45.1 would also like to flag that where any shortfall or discrepancy discovered after

   an audit is minor, my audit report would then only go to the Retail Line Manager

   and the Audit Manager. This is because a minor figure would not necessitate

   the involvement of the Investigation/Security Team to carry out further

   investigation.

                                                                                 WITNO9170100




46_The    level   of   discrepancy   that   is   considered   reportable    to   the

   Investigation/Security Team has changed over the years, and I cannot

   remember what the minimum figure would have been at the time of the Riby

   Square audit in May 2004, however, the Â£60,000 cash shortfall initially reported

   to me by Mr Blakey will have been well over the minimum figure at the time.




47. In the first few years of my Auditor career, it was common practice for Auditors

   to ask SPMs to make good any discrepancies on the day of an audit.

   Alternatively, we would request that it is made good at the point of the next

   weekly balance check. If an SPM was unable to make good any discrepancy,

   we would report this to our Area Manager who would then discuss matters with

   the SPM further. Nowadays, no one asks SPMs to make good any

   discrepancies. Instead they are settled to the SPM's account. I am unable to

   pinpoint from memory when this change came into force.



48. In terms of Auditors being given instructions on taking payment from SPMs, I

   am unable to recall any specific scenarios in which this may have taken place_

   However, I can vaguely recall occasions early on in my career where money

   was deposited in the tills at a branch just after an audit had been completed to

   make good a variance. A receipt would have been given and I imagine the

   instructions for such steps would have been contained in the Auditor

   instructions manual in place at the time.

                                                                                WITNO9170100




49. It has always been the case during my Auditor career that on the day of the

   audit SPMs are permitted to provide their own information or undertake their

   own investigation in relation to any shortfall discovered, if they so wish. For

   example, if an SPM wishes to double check the total figures found by the

   auditing team, we always allow this. SPMs would also be able to obtain their

   own print outs from the Horizon IT system so they would be able to carry out

   their own investigations into the cash and stock figures if they wished.



50. When I first began my Auditor career, we were able to ask SPMs why a

   discrepancy exists, to give them an opportunity to provide further information.

   However, we are no longer permitted to proactively seek this information. I

   believe this is because it is considered more appropriate for this information to

   be obtained by the Investigation/Security Team. I cannot recall when this

   change to the process occurred.



51. In normal circumstances, an Audit Team will continuously communicate the

   level of progress during an audit to the branch SPM. For example, once

   we finish counting the first stock unit, we would update the SPM of our

   findings in relation to the balance of that particular unit, before moving on to

   the next. We would also inform the SPM when we are likely to finish the audit,

   so they have an idea of when the branch can reopen. At the end of an

   audit, we carry out a closure meeting to verbally discuss our findings,

   which would also form the basis of our audit report. This was not the

   case during the audit of the Riby Square Branch, as the Investigation/

   Security Team got involved immediately and were on site at the branch

                                                                                    WITN09170100
                                                                                  WITNO9170100




   by the time the audit was completed. I deal with the steps that were taken on

   this day later in my statement.



52. An SPM is always able to raise any concerns to an Audit Team during an audit

   by simply speaking to the team at the branch that day. If the concern needs to

   be escalated, the Audit Team can call the Retail Line Manager to discuss the

   issue and the Retail Line Manager will then consider what steps can be

   followed.



53. Where the Horizon IT system cannot be accessed, it is still possible to conduct

   a branch audit. First the relevant branch figures would have to be obtained

   from the central accounting team at Chesterfield, then all cash and stock would

   have to be transferred to a cash and stock centre for the balance to be counted

   externally. If Chesterfield were not able to provide the relevant figures, it would

   be for the Audit Team to first count the cash and stock at the branch (if

   possible), list it and then send it to the cash and stock centre. The cash and

   stock centre would then liaise with the accounting team at Chesterfield to marry

   the figures up. These processes would often be implemented where a branch

   had suffered damage from flooding or fire and is unsafe to visit or the Horizon

   IT system is down. I note that further information about this can be found in the

   following document provided: "Post Incident Auditing without Horizon", Chapter

   14 of the Audit Process Manual (version 1.0, Nov 2006) (POL00084003).



54.I have been asked to describe and explain any variation between the audit

   process in respect of Crown Office branches and other branches. The only


                                 Page 18 of 32
                                                                                      WITN09170100
                                                                                    WITNO9170100




      variation I am aware of is that Crown Office Branches carry out extra internal

      audits by their managers, as well as the external audits that the Post Office

      Audit Team carry out. At a standard post office branch, audits are rarely carried

      out internally. I have learned from document (POL00083966) that Crown Post

      Office branches have to complete an annual certificate of compliance after

      carrying out self-assessments. Whilst I was aware that self-assessments were

      carried out, I was not aware that the results were then reported until reading

      document (POL00083966).



55. I have been asked to consider the following documents:


         a. "Audit Trail Functional Specification" (version 8.0, 18 October 2004)

            (FUJ00001894); and

         b. Global User Account (September 2016) (POL00002841).



   56. The first document noted above sets out the types of reports that Auditors are

      able to obtain from the Horizon IT system. It is important to note that over the

      years, report types have been added and taken away from this list, but I cannot

      specifically recall what specific documents and when. The second document

      noted above sets out the basis by which Auditors are able to access the Global

      User account on the Horizon IT system.



   57.Other than providing the relevant kit, Fujitsu had no involvement in the audit

      process. If there is a problem with the kit itself, for example, it has frozen, I

                                                                               WITNO9170100




   would contact the national support centre to see if they could provide a

   potential solution.




58. In terms of the information that an SPM can access, all information that

   Auditors are able to access during an audit is also available to the SPM via

   their Horizon User Profile.



59. My understanding of an Audit Global User Account is that it provides Auditors

   special access to the Horizon IT system in order to settle discrepancies to the

   Central Accounts Team at Chesterfield. Where a discrepancy is found at a

   branch, I will log out of my Personal User Account and log in to the Global User

   Account to remove the discrepancy from the Post Office account. This process

   describes my main experience in using the Audit Global User Account, but I

   am also aware that it may be used in situations where a Personal User Account

   cannot be accessed.




60.1 cannot recall any specific measures in place in respect of Audit Global User

   Accounts. I just know that the Global User Account should only be used in the

   situations I have described in paragraph 59 above, and our Personal User

   Accounts should be used for anything else. In addition, we now have to inform

   an SPM that we are logging on to the Global User Account in order to remove

   the discrepancy from the Post Office accounts, but I cannot remember the

   specific date that this requirement came in to force

Audit of Riby Square Branch and Prosecution of Mr David Charles Blakey


   61. 1 have been asked to set out my recollection of this case. I would like to reiterate

      that as this incident occurred almost 20 years ago I do not have a precise and

      clear recollection of the events and I have had to rely heavily on the following

      documents produced to me:


         a. My witness statement in the proceedings against Mr Blakey, dated 23

             November 2004 (POL00044819);

         b. the record of Mr Blakey's interviews on 13 May 2004 (POL00044830)

             and (POL00044831); and

         c. the offender report in respect of Mr Blakey (POL00044823)_



   62.1 would also like to note that the first time I have had sight of the documents

      listed in 'b' and `c' above was when they were produced to me for the Request.



   63.1 first became involved in Mr Blakey's case on the morning of 13 May 2004

      when I attended Riby Square Branch to carry out the scheduled audit.



   64.1 cannot remember if the audit of 13 May 2004 was a routine audit or if my line

      manager had requested it to be scheduled but it appears from reading my

      statement dated 23 November 2004 that it may have been the latter due to the

      value of cash at branch reported. All I know is that it was scheduled for that

      date and for 3 of us to attend. From reading my statement, it appears it was

      scheduled in early May 2004.The decision to send 3 of us to complete the audit




                                     Page 21 of 32
                                                                                  WITNO9170100
                                                                                WITNO9170100




   would have been based on the size of the branch and the number of customer

   sessions on the Horizon IT system.



65. In terms of the process by which the audit was conducted on 13th May 2004,

   as described in my statement, on the morning of 13th May 2004 I attended the

   Riby Square branch before it opened with my colleagues Christopher Taylor

   and Lynne Eastwood. I would often carry out audits with Christopher and Lynne

   and we all lived within close proximity to each other. As such, I believe that it

   probably made sense for us to be grouped together to complete audits when

   they were scheduled at branches in our local area.



66. Myself, Christopher and Lynne were all at the same Auditor level, but I took the

   lead in the audit that day, with both Christopher and Lynne assisting me. This

   is indicated by the fact that it was me who relayed the morning's events by

   telephone to the Senior Auditor, Retail Line Manager and Investigations/

   Security Team and requested to Mr Blakey that he make a statement of the

   information he told us about the shortfall.



67_There was no specific reason as to why I took the lead that day; we often took

   it in turns and decided between ourselves. However, at that time it was me who

   lived the closest to the Riby Square Branch out of all three of us, and I believe

   that this may have influenced the decision for me to take the lead.



68. Upon arrival to the Riby Square Branch I spoke with David Blakey's wife, Gillian

   Blakey, who I knew to be the SPM. I cannot remember what I specifically said


                                 Page 22 of 32
                                                                                  WITNO9170100
                                                                                WITNO9170100




   to Mrs Blakey but it would have involved an explanation as to why we were

   there and a request for her to present us with all the cash and stock present at

   the branch so it could be included in the audit. I would have also explained that

   the branch would need to remain closed that day until we had been able to

   carry out the audit, but we would try our best to complete the audit as soon as

   possible so that they could reopen. Of course in the end they were unable to

   re-open that day due to the discrepancies found and the events that

   subsequently followed.



69.As the Horizon IT system was implemented at the time of the Riby Square

   audit, we would have first obtained printouts from each stock unit to retrieve

   and consider the information of what cash, cheques, vouchers and stock

   should exist in the branch, before then opening the safe and proceeding with

   the asset verification process. I cannot remember precisely how many stock

   units there were at the branch.



70.1 do remember that whilst we were waiting to obtain access to the office safe,

   a man arrived to the branch and asked to speak to myself, Christopher and

   Lynne. I later learned that this was David Blakey, Gillian Blakey's husband. I

   cannot directly remember what Mr Blakey looked like or the exact discussion

   that myself and my colleagues had with him, so I am entirely reliant on my

   statement dated 23 November 2004. This states that "...Mr Blakey informed

   us that we would find a shortage in the cash of around Â£60,000, and this was

   due to, in his words, money going missing after a few months. "

71.As per that statement, after Mr Blakey told me this information I asked him to

   produce a short written statement about what he had told us. When he had

   completed this, I do not recall speaking to Mr Blakey again that day.



72.1 believe that my request to Mr Blakey to make a statement would have

   followed the phone calls I made to report the circumstances to Craig

   Thompson, Senior Auditor, Jayne Kaye, Retail Line Manager and Paul

   Whitaker from the Investigation Team. I believe that it would have been Paul

   Whitaker who instructed me to ask Mr Blakey to make a statement.



73.After obtaining the statement from Mr Blakey, I do recall that myself,

   Christopher and Lynne continued to carry out the audit until Jayne Kaye, Paul

   Whitaker and his colleague Helen Dickinson arrived. I cannot remember the

   precise discussions that I had with Ms Kaye, Mr Whitaker and Ms Dickinson

   when they arrived, but as per my statement dated 23 November 2004 I believe

   it involved a breakdown of the day's events to that point and a hand over of the

   statement completed by Mr Blakey, before they then left us to compete the

   audit.



74.1 cannot recall where Ms Kaye, Mr Whitaker and Ms Dickinson went after they

   left us to finish the audit, but from reading the record of Mr Blakey's interviews

   on 13 May 2004 in documents (POL00044830) and (POL00044831), I can see

   that it was to carry out an interview with Mr Blakey. I confirm that I had no

   involvement in carrying out this interview and until these documents were

   produced to me with the Request, I had no knowledge of what was discussed.

75. 1 do not recall from direct memory the precise shortage we discovered following

   the completion of the audit at the Riby Square branch on 13 May 2004. I

   therefore rely entirely on my witness statement dated 23rd November 2004

   which gives a total figure of Â£64,434.12.



76. Following the completion of the audit, I produced an audit report and provided

   it to the Retail Line Manager, Ms Kaye. I believe that I would have also provided

   it to the Investigation/Security Team, due to the total shortfall figure that was

   found.



77. Whilst I cannot remember my exact thoughts at the time, from an asset

   verification standpoint I do not believe that I would have been overly concerned

   about the total shortage discovered, as it was close to the Â£60,000 figure that

   Mr Blakey had informed us about prior to starting the audit. If Mr Blakey had

   not informed us about the shortage beforehand, or he had stated it to be much

   lower than Â£60,000, then I probably would have been more concerned.



78. The concern about any potential misconduct was not an aspect for the Audit

   Team to consider and I do not recall having any particular view on this.



79.1 do not think that I would have considered the size of the shortage to be

   unusual, as by this point in my career I had come across several large

   shortages at different branches following the many audits I had completed over

   the years.

80.After reporting to the Senior Auditor, the Retail Line Manager and the

   Investigation/Security Team on the day what Mr Blakey had told us about the

   shortfall and then obtaining a short written statement from Mr Blakey as

   instructed, I did not undertake any further investigation to ascertain the cause

   of the shortfall. As explained earlier in this statement, it did not fall upon the

   Audit Team to carry out any further investigation, as this is a responsibility that

   lies with the Investigation/Security Team.



81. 1 have been asked whether or not ARQ logs were sought by the Post Office

   from Fujitsu in this case. I do not know what ARQ logs are and this is not

   something which formed part of the audit process.



82.1 do not know whose decision it was to suspend Mr Blakey following the events

   on 13 May 2004. I believe that it could have been the decision of the Retail

   Line Manager.



83.Aside from Mr Blakey's case, I have not been involved in any other proceedings

   against SPMs, their managers or assistants, or Post Office employees

   involving shortfalls shown by the Horizon IT system.



84. Beyond my actions on the day of the audit (as described above), my only other

   involvement in the case of Mr Blakey was to produce my witness statement

   dated 23rd November 2004. I believe that it was Paul Whitaker who asked me

   to produce this.

85. 1 believe that the only person that I would have had contact with when drafting

   my statement dated 23rd November 2004 was Paul Whitaker, however, I cannot

   remember how the drafting came about. My assumption is that it was

   completed during a meeting to go through events with Mr Whitaker.



86.When I was asked to produce the statement, I remember thinking that the

   situation must be serious and that it was likely that some form of action was

   being taken against Mr Blakey. However, I had no discussion with any counsel

   or legal representatives for the Post Office about my role as a witness in the

   case and I had no idea if it was civil or criminal action being considered.



87. 1 have been asked what my view is of how the prosecution was conducted by

   Post Office Limited. I cannot provide any view as to this I have no knowledge

   of the steps and processes that were taken by the Post Office in this

   prosecution.



88.After I provided my statement on 23rd November 2004, I heard nothing further

   in the case of Mr Blakey. I do not recall being contacted to assist any further in

   the run up to the decision to charge him, nor was I asked to attend court or give

   evidence in his proceedings or informed of the outcome of such proceedings.

   I did not know anything about the case, including how Mr Blakey pleaded or

   what his sentence was until I heard from the Inquiry on 17th August 2023.

   89. 1 have been asked to consider the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in

      Josephine Hamilton & Others v Post Office Limited [2021] EWCA Crim

      (particularly paragraphs 347 to 352) at (P0L00113278), and to provide my

      reflections on the investigation that was done in Mr Blakey's case. I would like

      to emphasise to the Inquiry that I do not feel that I can offer any valuable

      reflection on this as I am unfamiliar with how an investigation is carried out by

      the investigations team and what actions are considered appropriate or not.

      Auditors are not involved in the investigation process.

General

   90. By the time of the audit of Riby Square in May 2004, 1 cannot ever recall a

      challenge to the Horizon IT system being raised. I cannot recall when I first

      heard about any potential issues with Horizon, but I can recall that we were

      reassured by the Post Office regarding the integrity the Horizon IT system.



   91. 1 am unable to comment on whether the Post Office carried out sufficient

      investigation into bugs, errors and defects in Horizon, nor as to whether

      information regarding bugs, errors and defects in Horizon was sufficiently

      passed to the Post Office by Fujitsu. I simply have no knowledge in relation to

      this. All I can say is that if bugs, errors and defect were discovered and known

      about by the Post Office then I believe that the Audit Team should have been

      informed about this.


   92. 1 believe that matters concerning information passed between the Post Office

      Limited and Fujitsu about bugs and defects with the Horizon IT system, and

   investigations carried out by the Post Office into the same, are more relevant

   to the Post Office Investigation/Security or Legal teams.


93.Other than what I have already provided in my statement above, I have no

   further reflections on these matters, or on any other matters that are relevant

   to the Inquiry's Term of Reference.


94. There are also no other matters that I wish to bring to the attention of the Chair

   of the Inquiry.
