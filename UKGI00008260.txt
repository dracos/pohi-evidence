Thanks.

Very helpful.

Let me review with Al and Jane on Monday.

I suggest we meet as a group to go through the framework, the work plan (list) and any
outstanding concerns around ways of working?

When do you go on leave?

Not sure yet.

I’m hoping not, if I can cover off with Tim at my 121.

But the list is important either way as I want to reassure Tim we’re
joined up!
