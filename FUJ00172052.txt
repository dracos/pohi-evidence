Mike,

Thanks for confirming. We are now updating the proposal accordingly and aim to have this to you by COB today.

Ed,

Were you going to send through some words in respect to the usage & treatment & distribution of reports provided by
KPMG to Fujitsu, such that we can include this in the proposal, and when we draft the Letter of Engagement we can
reflect this as well to remove the requirement for hold-harmless letters?

Ervin,

In respect to point 1, we understand that audit samples may not have been exhaustive to date, but our
requirements are for KPMG to highlight and such areas and caveat accordingly.

We are satisfied with the agreed approach on all other points of your response on 12"" December.

On your mail of 11° December, you talk to the two options:

Option 1) Review and assess with an initial Fujitsu internal only report on ‘as-is’. This gives Fujitsu the
opportunity to proactively determine exposure and address issues from the findings as a restricted
Fujitsu only document.

1.1) A follow-up review/test post any remediation carried out by Fujitsu over the findings. It is this
FUJ00172052
FUJ00172052

second report that you could use to issue externally, per your points below, as it would reflect the
assured and remediated controls — thus providing an independent perspective on the integrity of the
audit-trail for the system.

Option 2) Only Review, test and report on ‘as-is’. This would not reflect any Fujitsu management
action taken to address any findings.

We would appreciate both options to be put forward within your revised proposal in order we are able to
address all alternatives with our stakeholders.

Subject: RE: Horizon OnLine Integrity Testing: Proposal

Hi Mike,

Further to my call with Ed covering the clause relating to use and distribution of the final deliverables, please
find our responses to your other questions as follows:

1. Fujitsu already complies to audits on procedure, process and policy hence it would be anticipated
that these would be cross referenced and effectively out of scope from this KPMG audit. Our scope is to
ensure the technical assurance of transactions. However, page 6 suggest otherwise.

KPMG RESPONSE

We will cross reference to existing audits where these have taken place. We have used the wording “Perform
a detailed review of how integrity and security controls in the design of the system have been implemented.”
To indicate that we would want to review those audits and control documentation to ensure that the relevant
controls required to provide effective IT General Control are present in this specific system.

To do otherwise would leave open the possibility that whilst Horizon and its component parts were part of the
population audited in the previous audits, they might not have been part of the sample selected. Since our
review is specifically focussed on, and limited to this one system, we would want to be sure, either via the
work mentioned above, or by caveat that our work on the application was not undermined by any potential
problems relating to the General Control environment.

2. Please can we clarify exactly what KPMG means by “transaction types” in the paragraph on
document review on Page 12. Horizon supports a few thousand different types of transaction. However these
FUJ00172052
FUJ00172052

fall into about half a dozen broad categories and in all cases a transaction is recorded as part of a basket and
the integrity and auditing is related to the overall basket structure. If the reference to transaction type, means
one of these broad categories of transactions, then that is fine, but we feel it is unnecessary to investigate all
types of Horizon transaction. We would expect this to be clarified as part of the “Understanding” sessions.

KPMG RESPONSE
By this we mean the broad categories, as you’ve noted.

3. The exact same process applies for every transaction type, hence we deem it unnecessary to test all
transaction types. The integrity of the data in the audit trail is covered by the digital signature. Page 12 talks
to understanding of different transaction types.

KPMG RESPONSE
This is similar to point 2 and we would therefore seek to test each of the “broad categories” .

4. Documentation — is available, but whether this is in the preferred KPMG format is unlikely. We are
concerned that this would grant an open licence to significantly increase the cost to Fujitsu whilst we
would derive little benefit to ourselves.

KPMG RESPONSE

We are able to work with a variety of different documentation formats. We would seek to utilise as much
existing documentation as possible and would not wish to reinvent any wheels. Our aim to add value to what
you already have as opposed to duplicating it.

With regard to addressing your concern around cost escalations, we have intentionally put stage gates in our
approach, with the first occurring early in phase 1, such that if the documentation or information gathered
does not provide a foundation to work with, we will work with you to identify a way forward, or in worst case
scenario, jointly agree that the engagement be stopped.

5. Future proofing: would you please split this piece out as an optional extra on the basis that if your
findings are merely to confirm good practice, then we might leverage little benefit from a future
proofing process.

KPMG RESPONSE
We will split this out as requested.

Let me know if you are ok with the above, and we will reflect accordingly in to the updated proposal.

My best

Ed,

Good to discuss, and we're on the same page and understanding regarding the reasons for the clause
and use of hold harmless.

As agreed, please confirm as part of Fujitsu's statement of requirements,( that we will mirror into the
proposal and engagement letter), some words covering the intended use and treatment of the reports
and findings delivered by KPMG to Fujitsu for this engagement.

This can then de-risk the matter, removing the need for hold-harmless in relation to Fujitsu's
distribution of the reports

Thanks for the reply and clarification.
Your 1.1) below appears contradictory with your proposal

“At the conclusion of Phase two, Fujitsu will have a comprehensive report to be used only for
its own internal risk and commercial compliance assessment”

,but this may be my naivety in your latter comment below regarding distribution.

I would like Ed to bottom out on this point with you please. If it is possible to get a

down and can do this in coming days.

Subject: RE: Horizon OnLine Integrity Testing: Proposal

Hi Mike,

The reason for this clause is to support Fujitsu’s requirement to undertake a proactive
‘internal’ risk assessment, whereby the report is used initially by Fujitsu to determine
and inform its legal position, and act on any gaps, and perform remediation from the
findings.

Stage 1 & 2 effectively enable Fujitsu to assert the existence of controls, and for
KPMG to then test and validate these assertions based on agreed-upon procedures.

As discussed at the scoping meeting there are two options, which we understand
option 1 being the Fujitsu requirement:

Option 1) Review and assess with an initial Fujitsu internal only report on ‘as-is’. This
gives Fujitsu the opportunity to proactively determine exposure and address issues
from the findings as a restricted Fujitsu only document.

1.1) A follow-up review/test post any remediation carried out by Fujitsu over the
findings. It is this second report that you could use to issue externally, per your points
below, as it would reflect the assured and remediated controls — thus providing an
independent perspective on the integrity of the audit-trail for the system.

Option 2) Only Review, test and report on ‘as-is’. This would not reflect any Fujitsu
management action taken to address any findings.

For both options, should Fujitsu want to waiver its legal privileges regarding the
distribution of the deliverable reports externally and to other parties, this will be
subject to agreement of ‘hold harmless’ letters with KPMG. This is because Fujitsu’s
requirement in this case is bespoke compared to a SAS70 or ISA3042 equivalent
certification and audit opinion, which can typically be freely distributed by Fujitsu.

Let me know what time suits you to discuss on Monday.

Ervin

Subject: RE: Horizon OnLine Integrity Testing: Proposal

Ervin,

As previously mentioned I aim to come back to you early next week in respect
to our points on your proposal having briefed my stakeholders.

A key area noted, however, is the restriction on page 3 under heading “Stage
Two” that “...Fujitsu will have a comprehensive report to be used only for its
own internal risk and commercial compliance assessment. “

We are primarily commissioning this report in order to inform our legal team,
as discussed. However, if we later choose to waive legal privilege on this
document, we would be expect to be able to produce it freely in to other
auditors, Post Office, in disputes (either between us and Post Office, or where
we are supporting Post Office in defending the integrity of its systems). We
appreciate that you will not be expert witnesses, but that is a separate issue
to not being able to use this document for any external purpose. We
therefore need to understand whether this is intended to be a restriction on
use of the report, and if so, we need this restriction to be relaxed and will
need to discuss with you how that can be achieved.

Could we please set up a quick call on Monday morning to discuss the intent
of this clause?

Thank you.

Ervin,

Apologies for the delay in getting back to you.

We need KPMG to define a set of scenarios taking enough to
demonstrate robustness of the overall process. This may be
more than the scenarios that we have defined, but need
KPMG to make this recommendation

The objective is to audit the integrity of the overall basket
process. Transaction audits should not be necessary to

achieve this.

Subject: RE: Horizon OnLine Integrity Testing

HI Mike,

I hope you had a nice weekend. Just as an update - We're
aiming to get the proposal back to you by this Thursday for
your review.

We have a few questions in relation to your updated scoping
document:

e Section 1.2 — Scope. In shaping our approach, we
will define an agreed-upon proceedure for the
audit. To help guide and size the audit, will
Fujitsu have a mimimun or maximum number of
prescirbed transaction types to be tested?

e Section 1.3 - Deliverables: For clarity, Fujitsu have
specified the delivery of an ‘ audit report’ that may be
FUJ00172052
FUJ00172052

submitted in court to demonstrate adequacy of the
controls in place. As discussed at our scoping
meeting, we can provide litigation support,
particularly of the nature in the scope of your
requirements. However as external auditors we are
restricted from providing expert witness services,
particularly where there is a quantum aspect that
results in us actually self auditing such material
values through the external audit.

e Section 3.0 —for clarity, we interpret these
scenarios as the ‘test scenarios’ that may occur
stand-alone or in combinations, in which
transaction audits need to be validated against.
Is this correct?

In our proposal response we will outline an approach in terms
of two iterations of deliverables. This will enable us to
expedite the initial findings audit report for Fujitsu ‘ONLY’
review and action. With the second iteration reflecting your
comments/feedback that will be subject to final risk review by
KPMG such that the final release can be relied-upon.

Many thanks,
Ervin
