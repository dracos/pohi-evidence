1.0 Introduction

This document describes the Post Office Account Systems Integration Directorate Incident/Defect Management
process, which has been decomposed identifying the following Sub Processes:

e — Incident Capture
© — Quality Filter Process
o Incident Analysis
© Change Management Actions
o Solution Components
¢ Incident Closure
© Target Release Assignment
¢ Defect Resolution
¢ Defect Test and Closure
The document is organised in three sections:
Section 2.0 describes an end-to-end view of the process and illustrates the major owners of Incidents raised.

Section 3.0 describes a summary of the IncidenvDefect Management Process, identifying; sub processes,
process flows, inputs and outputs.

Section 4.0 describes each sub-process identifying; process flows, inputs and outputs

2.0 Scope

The process recognises two major threads of ownership for Incidents raised:

e Customer Service for Incidents generated from the live service and associated activities e.g. Live
Calls, CS Reference Data Team, CS Management Support Unit, ISD and Live Support Team. (This last
continues to hold true even though organisationally LST is now within the Systems Integration
Directorate)

e Development for Incidents generated by: Post Office Account Test Units (other than LST) and
Development Units during planned testing activities.

Two sub-processes are also established as services to these End-to-End Threads:
© Quality Filter Process.
¢ Defect Resolution.

For completeness and to facilitate understanding of the end-to-end nature of the process all components have
been described. However, many of the components will be complemented by local work instructions or replaced
by other processes, for example CS/PRD/074, (Customer Service Incident Management for Incident Capture),

It should also be noted that Customer Service has its own processes covering: Incident Capture; Incident
Closure; Release Management Forum; and Defect Test and Closure. Customer Services also own CS/FSP/006
the document that defines the operational responsibilities of the units involved in the end to end support of the
software delivering the Post Office Account solution in relation to each other.

The process flow diagrams include information required to update Call records in PinICL, which is the Post
Office Account tool for Incident/Defect Management. Principally this is an attempt to reinforce correct use of
Response Codes, Product and Product Group fields.

3.1.2 Process description

Process Owner: System Integration Director.

Process Objectives: To capture, record and respond to Incidents.
To identify and isolate Defects.

To test and deliver Fixes.

Process Rationale: The process is built on the PinICL System fundamental that only the Call
Logger of an Incident or a member of the same team may close that Incident.

Incident Closure and Defect Test and Closure are the Sub Processes that
verify if the documented conclusions have satisfied the Incident as stated.

Incidents originating from the live service are managed in cooperation with
Customer Service with the Release Management Forum authorising any
change to Target Release.

A record is maintained throughout the life of the Incident/Defect and all
decisions catalogued in the Call in the PinICL system.

FUJ00079902

Process Rationale:

‘Any member of Post Office Account staff identifying a PinICL trigger event
MUST originate an Incident or cause an Incident to be originated.

The Incident needs to be supported by evidence and a description of the
circumstances under which it was observed.

Local Management needs to approve the Incident prior to passing it on to the
Quality Filter Process for analysis.

The vast majority of Incidents captured originate from scripted testing or
from the live service.

Live service Incidents arrive with the target release set (provisionally) at the
current release.

All other Incidents have the target release set to Unknown by the system, but
the Call Logger should update the text to include a recommendation for
release.

Inputs/Triggers:

Formal Test Stage.
Live Service.

Live Service Support
Observation.

The trigger is the formal description of the Incident and associated evidence.

Sub Processes:

None

Resources: Potentially all Post Office Account Programme Staff, but mainly:
ITU Staff who undertake testing
Development Unit Staff who undertake testing
CS Staff that support the live estate

Outputs: Approved Incidents for analysis.

Standards: PinICL Training Manual and PinICL Reference Data Guide.

FUJ00079902

Process Rationale:

The process operates under the control of the Incident/Defect Manager.
QFP Representatives are identified for each Development Unit.

QFP Administration maintains a list of these representatives.

QEP Administration assigns Incidents to QFP Representatives for analysis.

The QFP Representatives are responsible for ensuring that either the Incident
is recommended for closure or a potential product Defect is identified.

If the Incident has been incorrectly assigned it is returned to QFP
Administration with a recommendation as to where it should go.

As Incidents are routed for analysis to the QFP Stack, QFP Representatives
are expected to identify and assign to themselves Incidents relevant to their
own product areas. They should not wait for QFP administration to assign
the Incidents.

This is a fast moving process and the emphasis is on appropriateness, so the
steps indicated in the Process and Sub Processes can and do happen in a
different order to that shown.

The QFPF also can happen at different times during the process and if
required Incidents are reviewed more than once.

Incident/Defect Management Version: 2.0
Date: 5 Sep 2003

Process Initial investigation is undertaken.

Rationale: If the QFP Representative believes this Incident or this Incident plus others reveals a System
design weakness then it can be escalated to RASD as a Problem and progressed in
accordance with the Post Office Account Development Directorate Problem Management
Process, DE/PRO/016.

The priority of the call has to be agreed and any discussions undertaken with the Call Logger

if the priority needs to be changed.

Suspected build Incidents may be routed directly to the PIT team.

An Incident can be updated and returned to the Call Logger for a variety of reasons ¢.g.:

No fault in product.

User error.

Duplicate call.

Insufficient Evidence.

The Incident can be updated and routed to the DU Technical Authors if baseline documents

are impacted for review under the Change Management Sub Process.

The Incident can be updated and routed for further detailed review by the Development Unit

and identification of solution components.

A QFPF review is required if the Target Release has not been set or is inappropriate.
Inputs/Triggers: I Approved Incidents.

Incidents returned by Call Logger.
Incidents returned afler Defect consideration.
Incidents returned from RASD Problem Management Process.

Incidents returned from Change Management for further consideration.

Process Rationale:

The QFP Representative ensures that all solution components are identified
and can be progressed satisfactorily. If appropriate, a workaround solution
may be required for the current baseline as well as a longer-term solution or
consequential work may be required in another Development Unit, which has
to be worked on in parallel.

Copy (Clone) PinICLs should be used for this task with a separate PinICL
raised for each piece of work. The PinICL should be updated with a clear set
of instructions so that the relationships are clear. The procedure for raising
clone PinICLs is covered in the PinICL Reference Data Guide
CM/MAN/005.

Discussion with CS if a KEL entry is required or needs to be updated. The
Procedure for updating/creating KELs is contained in the PinICL Reference
Data Guide CM/MAN/005.

A QFPF review is required if the Target Release has not been set or is
inappropriate.

For calls where a live fix impact has been requested an Impact statement is
produced and sent to the RMF for Target Release consideration.

Inpuis/Triggers:

Incident — Initial analysis completed.
Target Release assigned by QFPF/RMF.

Sub Processes: None.
Resources: QFP Representative.
Problem Management.
Outputs: Incidents - all solution componenis.
Impacted Incidents for live Fix decision by the RMF.

Process Objectives: I Ensure an appropriate Target Release is selected and approved for the delivery of the

corrected Defect.

Process Rationale: Under the control of the Incident/Defect Manager interactions, are initiated across the
programme to ensure the appropriate Target Release is identified and agreed.

Two meetings are used to facilitate this:
Release Management Forum.

Quality Filter Process Forum.

The QFPF comprises:
Development Unit QFP Representatives.

Release Managers.

Typically during intense periods of formal testing, QFPF meetings will take place daily.

Incident/Defect Management is represented at the weekly CS Release Management Forum
where Target Releases for designated calls originating from the live service are
determined.

QFPF review the Incidents and an appropriate Target Release is identified.

If any Fix is proposed to a Release that would impact the planned testing of that Release,
whether by impacting areas of the system that were not to change in that Release, or to
introduce types of testing not already included in that Release or to complicate the Release
and its migration, the issue must be referred to Morning Prayers for discussed with the
POL Release Manager.

Ifa live Fix is being recommended the Incident is updated requesting that a live Fix impact
is to be provided to the RMF for consideration

QFPF and/or RMF (as appropriate) also consider the re-targeting of calls to a different
release where a previously-agreed release is no longer achievable

The QFPF also provides an opportunity to arrange KEL entries with the SSC representative
for agreed Incidents. The procedure for creating and modifying KELS is in the PinICL
Reference Data Guide CM/MAN/005.

At the discretion of the Incident/Defect Manager and Post Office Accounts Programme
Management the QFPF review deferrals:

System Test Incidents.
Business Test Incidents.
All Incidents associated with a baseline being released into the live service.

Live calls recommended for deferral by the QFPF are sent to the RMF for approval. A
clone call is arranged to progress the Incident at the nominated deferred release whilst the
original is returned to the RMF for consideration. The text is updated to reflect the priority
perceived with a recommendation for closure as fixed in a future release. This is either
agreed at RMF (and the Incident closed by the SSC) or a live Fix is requested and the
Incident returned to QFP.

All decisions agreed by the RMF or QFPF are recorded in the Incident.

With the agreement of all QFP representatives, low (typically D priority) calls may have a
KEL raised to describe them and then be closed.

Inputs/Triggers:

Incidents with Potential Solutions Identified.

Live Incidents recommended for deferral

Sub Processes:

None.

Outputs:

Incident with Target Release agreed.

Standards:

Process Rationale:

DE/PRO/003 Fujitsu Services Post Office Account System Integration
Lifecycle Processes CM/PRD/001 Software Configuration Management
Version Control and CM/PRD/003 Work Package request are applicable to
this Process.

The relevant Development Unit undertakes detailed analysis work
identifying the Fix to be made.

The Development Unit must also check regularly that all calls targeted at a
given Release can be completed for that Release. As soon as it becomes clear
that some calls may not be fixed within the timescales, threatened calls must
be returned to QFP/RMF for further consideration.

A further check is made to ensure no contract controlled documents are
impacted e.g. PPDs. If there are impacts the Incident must be sent to the
Design Authority as a change management action.

If a number of software baselines are being progressed in parallel then a
clone PinICL is required to track each change to each baseline. A common
example would be a live Fix where a clone of the Live Fix would be required
to the current baseline being developed. The procedure for creating clone
PinICLs is identified in the PinICL Reference Data Guide CM/MAN/005.

The Fix is Unit and Link Tested then delivered by PIT ready for testing by
the Call Logger.

A handover note is produced identifying dependencies etc, This is
documented in CM/PRD/001 Software Configuration Management Version
Control.

Build Incidents are analysed by PIT who either accept and Fix the Defect or
reject for further analysis by QFP as more likely a Development Unit
Incident.

Inputs/Triggers:

Suspected build Incidents passed directly to PIT for action.
Suspected build Incidents from QFP.
Fix fails for correction.

Potential Product Defects with approved Target Release from either RMF or
QFPF.

Sub Processes:

None.

Resources: Development Units.
Technical Integration.

Outputs: Resolved defects ready for testing.
Potential Product Defects returned to QFP for further consideration (either
from PIT or Development units).

Standards: PinICL Training Manual and PinICL Reference Data Guide.
