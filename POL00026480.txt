Thanks Drew ~ that’s really helpful and much appreciated.

Do you know what the current cash holdings are for the branches who are behind on their TPs?

Hi Rodric,

We've pulled off the last trading statements for the 94 non-suspended branches.
Column I on the attached file shows the variance in Trading Period to what is expected as of 10/12/2019.

Out of the 90 Branches, Only six are behind on their TP’s. Five by 1 Period and One by 2 Periods.
Three of the branches behind by 1 Period are 6 days late.

267340 Norwood is on time but 1 Period behind.

164941 Boughton Monchelsea is 27 days late and a period behind.

391207 Overseal is a full 2 Periods behind

Discrepancy wise, there are seven branches posting losses over £500, three over £1k.

lhave also added in how the discrepancy was settled, if there was one.

As far as general Fraud Analysis flags go, we would likely need another day to complete a general check of each one of
the 90 branches.

If this is something you would like us to look into tomorrow, you will need to contact, Rachelle Shimwell in my absence,

as I will be in Branch for a Golden Day.

Regards
Drew

Subje URGENT request for Mi - Branch Shortfalls / Settled Centrally

Thanks Tim.

Michelle ~ can you please give us the current balance (the “customer line” I think) for the branches referenced in the
attached Word document.

Drew ~ can you please check the same branches for compliance to monthly accounting, and flag any concerns you may
have from a fraud analysis perspective.

Thanks for your support, Rod

Hi Tim.
I've just left a voice message with you, but we have another request for MI.
A number of the Claimants are still serving postmasters. We would like to know what is the current status of

their branch accounts, e.g. are they balancing or do they shortfalls which they have settled centrally and not
paid.

Could you please give me a call back to discuss - or have someone in your team call me — or,
Thanks, Rod

We have only got figures back to September 2018 without going to Fujitsu for prior to that (in reality we only
have 90 days access to the data on Credence rather than the 2 years the team initially thought, but we have
kept records since September 2018 in Branch Analysis).

The figures are as follows:

Subject: URGENT request for MI - Branch Shortfalls / Settled Centrally

Hi Tim,
We urgently need some MI on branch shortfalls. Can you please let us know how much is settled centrally:

- each month (and by how many branches); and
- in each of the past 5 years.

Please give me a call if easier to discuss.
Thanks, Rod
