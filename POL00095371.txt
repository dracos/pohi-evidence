Dear Tim,

Closure of the Post Office in Runnymede Avenue, Cleveleys, Lancashire.

I am writing regarding a local press report on the closure of the above Post Office. It reports that the sub-
postmistress claims she was suspended from her job for refusing to “use computer equipment which she believes
was faulty”

According to this local press report, the sub-postmistress and her business partner had reverted to using the
manual system claiming the computer system was “incapable of doing the job”, and “if we were given it in
writing that the computer system was 100% fully operational we would use it.”

This has raised some concern for us in respect of the wider implications for the OBCS aspect of Horizon. We
would be very interested to know if there have been, or are any ongoing, similar incidences elsewhere. If so,
have they been fully resolved?

Could you also let us know if there are similar views amongst POCL staff which would throw doubt on the
effectiveness and accuracy of the Horizon System, especially if there is any specific reference to OBCS?

We are concerned about the accuracy of the claims detailed in this local press report and would be most grateful
for your assistance in this matter.

Angela Smith
