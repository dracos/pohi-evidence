Postmaster Survey Key Takeaways

Our focused engagement initiatives have driven improved metrics, with better response
rates and overall sentiment compared to previous years. Increased interaction with postmasters is proving to have a
positive effect on sentiment, with accelerated activity to support greater engagement, especially with the involvement and
visibility of senior leaders. Beyond our accelerated engagement initiatives, the business has made substantial
improvements across other critical areas including the Branch Support Centre (BSC), training, field team support and
quicker IT fix times, all contributing to the positive outcomes

Despite these achievements, many external factors have impacted our scores
negatively, highlighting the need for continued improvement. Key external events such as the cost-of-living crisis, Royal
Mail strikes, cyber-attacks, and media coverage (ITV drama and inquiry) have negatively impacted sentiment scores.

The sentiment scores have shown significant fluctuations over the past four years,
influenced by both Post Office actions and external factors. Despite some improvements, there has been increased
polarisation with more postmasters scoring at the extremes of the scale. (See next slide).

Satisfaction with remuneration is a critical driver of positive sentiment among PMs.
Despite some increases, remuneration remains the top priority and the area with the lowest perceived improvement.

The main themes for improvement identified are ‘leadership and culture’, ‘reputation
and trust’, and ‘future strategy’. Continuous engagement initiatives and feedback loops are planned to address these
areas and further improve postmaster sentiment. Over the last 4 years we have increased the number of postmasters
attending various listening groups and forums from 23 to 589, to help address underlying issues and create solutions.

There appears to be 2 main reasons for the polarisation of opinion:

1) Firstly, PUDO seems to have divided the network - those postmasters who have PUDO services seem to be happier and positive about the future,
whereas those who don’t have the services are clearly aware of the services and the benefits that it brings but are frustrated that they cannot offer

them.

2) Secondly, a culmination of the cost-of-living crisis, the ITV drama and inquiry, the various disclosures of bonus payments and the racial document
have increased negative sentiment considerably.

Colleague Survey

86% overall completion rate, this is +21pts from the 2023 Pulse (65%) and
+50% from the 2022 Engagement Survey (36%).

Colleague engagement is down 11% to 57%.
This is driven by colleague pride being down 22% to 43%.

Colleagues are still more motivated to do their best at Post Office than
employees in other businesses.

58% of colleagues intend to stay longer than 5 years.

POL00446704

Colleague Survey Key Takeaways

43% of comments from colleagues on improving their experience at Post Office related to
communications. Communications issues are undermining colleagues’ confidence in the
business and in senior leaders.

Colleagues are asking for a refreshed strategic intent beyond 2025 to be communicated.

Tech is less of a barrier for colleagues than it was previously, dropping by 17%, and
colleagues’ experience of their Line Manager has improved in 6 of 7 measures.

SLP and Band 4 colleagues describe Post Office as ‘bureaucratic’ and ‘political and are the
most ‘under strain’ at 81% and 77%. Compared to Admin colleagues who describe Post
Office as ‘friendly and ‘supportive’ and only feel 34% under strain.

Colleagues with a disability are least likely to feel included at Post Office, diverse ethnic
background colleagues are less likely to be positive about career progression, and senior
women are the most likely group to have received an unwanted comment.
