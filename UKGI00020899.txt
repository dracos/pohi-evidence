Hi Tom

Please find attached a summary prepared by the Post Office legal team that sets out — at a high level — details of the
major contracts.

Please note that these are provided to you as part of your induction as a director of Post Office Limited and should not
be circulated within UKGI or BEIS.

The team would be very happy to take you through these in more detail if that would be of benefit to understand the
wider commercial and strategic discussions over the next few months.

Kind regards,
Jane
