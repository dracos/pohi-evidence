Hope you are well.

As discussed on a call with Jess this morning, please see attached advice for clearance by SpAds and Minister Scully
regarding the approval of the exit package for the Post Office CFO ahead of it going to SoS for final approval.

As flagged on the call, we will be requesting urgent clearance as POL must conclude settlement negotiations [iE

Please see below a summary of the advice. Given the urgency, we will be submitting to SpAds and Minister Scully in
parallel.

This is highly sensitive so please handle this information with care. Thanks again to everyone for your assistance on
what is a very complex and sensitive issue.

Please let me know of any questions.
Purpose:

BEIS previously agreed to a request from POL for it to end the employment of its CFO. The last submission noted that
POL’s proposal for the terms of the CFO’s exit package would follow once initial Ministerial feedback was provided.

Timing: For clearance from Minister Scully and Special Advisors by 22 January, ahead of submission to SoS for
clearance by 29 January.
