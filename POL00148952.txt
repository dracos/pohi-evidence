We have conferred internally and the line to the BBC is nothing more than:

It is unfortunate that this Report, prepared for the mediation scheme, has been leaked when it was marked
confidential. This cannot be in the interest of those applicants who have applied to the Scheme and for that reason
we will not be commenting publicly on what is a leaked document.

Best wishes
Belinda

Hi Belinda,

We have the below pressing enquiry from BBC Look North and I was hoping you could help in Ruth, Mel and Nina’s

absence.

Do you have the latest external Q&As and statement on this? I have the following which could be used if appropriate
but would appreciate a steer from you.

A report into the Horizon system produced in July 2013 found that there were no systemic issues with the Horizon
system. However, it did find that improvements could be made in the training and support processes provided to

postmasters.

We acted quickly to review how we train and support our postmasters and have already made improvements to the
POL00148952
POL00148952

induction training approach and the ongoing support we offer to postmasters. We also put in place a business
improvements programme to determine how we can better provide effective and efficient support to postmasters
on an ongoing basis.

Thanks,

Cathal

Hello,

I'm a reporter from BBC Look North and I'm doing a report on the
findings of the briefing report part two prepared by Second Sight.

It carried out the Independent investigation into matters raised by
150 Subpostmasters, or former Subpostmasters, with particular
regard to the Horizon computer system.

It is highly critical of the Post Office and says there were faults
with the Horizon computer system and highlights a number of
problems..

The money from the post offices cash and lottery machines didn't
match the figure on the computer system.

In some branches the system recorded the sale of a 12 month tax
disc - when a 6 month one was sold.

Some sub postmasters said the training was insufficient and the
helpline was unhelpful.

The report said some of the computer hardware was old.

Post Office Investigators - it said - seemed more keen on
seeking a charge for false accounting rather than investigating
the route course of the suspected problems.

They disregarded the possibility that the Horizon's computer
POL00148952
POL00148952

system could've been at fault.

For some of the people who used it - the system was not fit for
purpose.

I'm not seeking an explanation for every single point raised, just a
reaction from the company to Second Sight's report.

I've also seen documentation from the Post Office which says.."
the report by Second Sight is not endorsed by Post Office. The
Post Office believes that the report is inaccurate in important

areas and that there is no clear statement of the evidence upon
which many of the opinions expressed in the report are based."

I was wanting to check if that was in fact the company's position.

The report is being put together today and will be broadcast on
Monday morning.

I would need a response at the very latest by 5pm toady.

An interview would be best, but I'd be happy with a statement - if
that was all that was available.

Thanks very much for your time.
Please shout if you have any questions.
