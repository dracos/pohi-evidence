Hi Both

I've included Shirley and Kath's comments in the attached. There are a couple of comments left in containing Angela's
comments and also explaining the addition by Shirley. We're also waiting for Charley to confirm the POL nos for the
exhibits.

Areas I have added from Rod:

a) Para 18.3 — new para — incorporating Rod's comment RE Horizon recording other users other than SP
and assistant — for example — auditor's ID

WBD_000157.000001
WBONO0000287
WBON0000287

Areas where further data would be useful but may not be able to obtain in time (please note I've now reviewed
the annotations/ comments in the statement):

b) Para 26.8 — data to support that following the introduction of PING, the volume of Lottery TCs reduced
substantially

c) Para 61 —RE network outage on 9 May 2016. Counsel has asked for: details of:
i. How many branches were impacted;
ii. I How common the outages were;

iii. I How many branches reported the outage

d) Para 64 — cost of the postage labels — can't see this in transaction log so have removed reference to
cost

e) Para 78 — Mr Tank's call logs — haven't been able to find these as of yet to review and summarise but
we reference the Peak to confirm it was resolved.

Areas Fujitsu still to confirm:

a) Para 13 - In relation to the "phantom sales" that were reported in around 2000, we still need Fujitsu to
confirm these:

i. appear to have been caused by hardware issues; and

ii. I should not have caused a discrepancy in a branch's accounts;

b) Para 18.4 — Whether Fujitsu are aware of any other reasons that a user ID could be affected.

c) Paras 105 — 114 — Angela Burke — are paras accurate

I've amended this to get it into shape. Use the version attached. Please can you go through and finalise all the blanks
and questions.

There are two issues at the end of Abdulla that I don't understand. Please can you look at these.
