compliance with a range of Business processes, procedures and
regulatory requirements.

27,811.98 short, subject to a reconciliation of some figures

Due to findings revealed at audit, and a decision taken by the
Contracts Advisor to temporary suspend you from your role as
subpostmaster pending further enquiries, compliance testing was
not carried out on this visit, therefore there are no appendices
attached.
