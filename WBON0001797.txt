Gideon

I attach a short note of the conf we had with Lord Grabiner.

Can you make sure it matches what you took from the conf ?

The ideal would be for Lord Grabiner to "OK" it this morning so it could go as a "confirmed" note (as opposed to simply
my note) to the Post Office Board in advance of the 11.45am call that Lord Grabiner has this morning with them. If that
can be done (assuming you are with Lord Grabiner at some point this morning) then great. If not, no worries.

Thanks
