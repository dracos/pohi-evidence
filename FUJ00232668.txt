SUMMARY and REASON FOR CHANGE:

As a consequence of the transfer of the Service Desk Service from Fujitsu to Atos, it has been agreed that changes
to the HNG-X Agreement relating to the provision of the Services will be necessary and the terms set out in this
Change Control Note (CCN) shall apply to amend the HNG-X Agreement from the date of signature of this
CCN1409.

This CCN sets out the changes necessary to remove the references to the Service Desk Service from the HNG-X
Agreement and to detail the changes necessary to the remainder of the Services to enable the continued provision of
the remainder of the Services under the Agreement. Such changes include the formation of the MAC (Major
Account Controller) team, the scope of which is detailed in Attachment I to this CCN. This CCN also details the
necessary adjustments to the Charges within the Agreement to reflect the changes that are being made to the
Services as a result of the termination of the Service Desk Service..

Due to the Expiry Date of the Service Desk Service being changed to the 2"! July 2014 from the 2" June 2014 and
the transfer of responsibilities and employees to the Next Supplier taking place on the 16" June if Fujitsu Services
fail to provide the Services in accordance with the Service Levels as a direct result of this transfer of
responsibilities Fujitsu Services shall continue to provide the Services to the extent it is able in accordance with the
Service Levels but may apply for relief as set out in Clause 39 of the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Fujitsu Employees shall transfer to the Next Supplier on the 16" June 2014 in accordance with the TUPE
Regulations, and the back-up solution which may be required to be provided by Fujitsu for the period between 17"
June and 2™ July 2014 shall not affect this transfer.

Any defined terms set out in this CCN shall have the meaning set out in the Agreement.

This CCN provides for:
1) The termination of the Service Desk Service with effect from 23:00 on the 2™ July 2014;
2) The amendment of references to the Service Desk Service from the Agreement;
3) The removal of the Charges associated to the Service Desk Service;
4) The remedial changes necessary to the remainder of the Services to enable the continued and uninterrupted
provision of such Services;

The remaining Services require some adjustment to enable them to continue to function when the
Service Desk Service ceases to be provided by Fujitsu.

The main amendment necessary in this area is the introduction of the new MAC Team (as defined
below) to be provided as part of the Service Management Service.

5) The necessary adjustments to the Charges defined in the Agreement to enable such changes to be effected;

The changes to the Charges in Schedule D1 as detailed in this CCN1409 are reflective of the
elements of the currently provided Service Desk Service which will transfer to the other Services and
of the increased workload required as a result of the termination of the Service Desk Service.

With regards to the Charges for the Service Management Service, the increase in Charges for the
years ending March 2016 and March 2017 will be lower than those for year ending 31“ March 2015
due to the expiry or termination of the Engineering Service. In the event that the Engineering
Service is extended beyond 31 March 2015 the Service Management Service Charge shall be
increased by £29,648.70 per month and such shall be detailed in the associated CCN to extend the
Engineering Service.

6) The calculation and detail of the Termination Charges payable by Post Office;

This has been calculated in accordance with the formula detailed in Schedule E clause 6.2 of the
Agreement whereby the calculation is made up of a calculation of costs in accordance with clause
6.2.1 and Lost profits in accordance with clause 6.2.2. In the case of this exit there has not been the
inclusion of any charges relating to Migration Costs as detailed in clause 6.2.3as these have been
charged separately under CTs where appropriate.

7) Service Volumetric Limits.

The termination of the Service Desk Services means that there are anticipated increases to the
volume of Incidents. CCN1400 agreed the Expected Engineering Volumes relating to the number of
Engineering Service Visits to Branch, however, it did not include the treatment of potential impacts
on other Services. It is agreed by the parties that, in the event of increases in the volume of activity
or other Service impacts which affect Fujitsu’s ability to perform the Services and which are
attributable to the termination of the Service Desk Service, this shall be managed in accordance
with the HNG-X Agreement and in particular, Clause 39.

PROPOSED REVISION TO WORDING OF THE AGREEMENT ( including Schedule reference)
Removal of References

In order to effect the termination of the Service Desk Service the references to the Service Desk Service throughout
the Agreement are to be removed in accordance with the detail below.
