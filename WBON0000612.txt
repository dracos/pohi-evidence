Hi Andy

Please see attached amended version together with comparison showing the changes made since counsel's amended
draft circulated this evening. I have left in 3 or 4 comments that need to be checked with David. Also, he needs to be
told to read carefully the stuff that has changed! He is very conscientious but worth saying.

I will forward under separate cover:

The exhibit and annex to the statement

The last version of the statement sent to David so that you can do a comparison. If you don't have any changes to
make (ha!) the comparison attached here would be correct to send to him.

Thanks for picking this up — much appreciated!

Thanks

Victoria
