Hi Shirley
Yes, Kath and Huw attending will be fine.

Kath — the meeting will be held at One Essex Court (Temple, London EC4Y 9AR) and we will be looking to start at
10am. If you ask for Tony Robinson on arrival, Andy and Elisa will also be there.

I will circulate a list of topics which Tony would like to discuss later on today.

Many thanks

Amy

Kath, Shirley

Further to our call yesterday, our counsel (Tony Robinson) would like to meet with you so as to discuss in further detail
some of the topics in the Defence. We will circulate a list of topics to be discussed shortly, but in summary these relate
to:

The introduction of Horizon / Horizon Online
SPMR access to information
The processes of daily cash balancing and end of trading period

Provision of training

Please could you confirm whether you would both be available on Wednesday, 7 June 2017 for a meeting? We would
like to pencil in the whole day for now (although it may be the case that we just need you for the morning).

Rod — please could you let me know if you would like to attend this and are available to do so?

Kind regards

Amy
