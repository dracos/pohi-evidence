LORD, Jonathan

To
MP Mr Jonathan Lord

Dear Mr Lord

1 am writing to you to ask for your urgent help with the position I now find myselfin. On
21* October 2010 at Guildford Crown Court after two days of deliberations thej jury returned.
a verdict of guilty to to the charge of Th Theft. wha
From 29* June 2005 to 14% January 20008 I was the sub postmisress at West Byflet Su Sub
Post Office. It was during this period that the Post Office said I had stole £75k from West
Byfleet Post office which is not true, as I was keep informing them about missing money.

Lam not guilty, just another victim of Post Office Limited and their Horizon system that has
caused such devastation to myself and to so many others around the country. 1 know that a
meeting took place a couple of weeks ago between Edward Davey the Minister for Postal
Affairs and a representative from Justice For Subpostmasters Alliance (FSA), the group that
‘been set up to expose what really has been happening to subpostmasters and this was in
response to other MP's requests. Edward Davey is currently meant to be looking into all this
and I would urge you to contact him to find out the latest and let him know what has
happened to me and ask for his help to stop this abuse.

Tam due to ‘retum to court for sentencing on 11" November 2010 and I really need your help

to raise my case at the highest level as a matter of urgency. I haven't done any crime,
please I beg for the sake of my family and for the name of god Please take these matter as

urgency. sree

Please contact me for any further information.

Your faithfully

SEEMA MISRA.
