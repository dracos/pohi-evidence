AUDIT RISK AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE NOTING PAPER
Author: Johann Appel Sponsor: Jane MacLeod Meeting date: 29 January 2019

Executive Summary

Context

The purpose of this paper is to update the Committee on the PO Internal Audit activity
and key outcomes. This includes details of the work completed since the last Audit, Risk
and Compliance Committee (ARC) meeting in October and progress on the 2018/19
Internal Audit Plan.

Questions this paper addresses

e Is the Internal Audit Plan on track? What progress has been made since the last
meeting?

e Do Internal Audit have adequate resources to deliver the Audit Plan?

e What progress is being made with completion of audit actions?

e Have any significant issues arisen that the committee should be aware of?
Conclusion

1. Progress against plan:

Following the appointment in October of Deloitte as our new co-source provider, and
successful recruitment of the two team vacancies, we are now making good progress
with delivery of the 2018/19 audit plan. We have finalised five audits since the last
ARC meeting in October. At the time of writing this report three audits were in reporting
with a further five in fieldwork. Current delivery progress is as follows:

2018/19 Combined Plan Status -Total Audits = 26

Not started

(arc approved baseline plan for 2018/19 (16 internal control reviews & 10 change assurance reviews).

A full summary of the 2018/19 audit plan status is included in Appendix 1.

Overdue (>60 days) (e)
Total 26

More detailed information is provided in paragraph 15 of the report.

3. Significant Issues:

Following the mid-year review of the audit plan, we proposed to the ARC that the total
number of audits be reduced from 26 to 22. This was done to compensate for the
delays caused by the transition to the new internal audit co-source provider as well as
internal vacancies. However, the ARC expressed their concerns about a number of
audits that we wanted to postpone, four of which were linked to the delayed
implementation of the Back Office Transformation Programme. The committee
requested that we complete the audit plan in full to provide assurance that controls
over key processes are still effective in the interim period. The committee accepted
that this would require additional co-source support, which is estimated to be £72k
(net of savings from staff vacancies).

There are no other significant issues we believe the committee should be made aware
of.

Input Sought

The Committee is asked to note and provide comment as necessary.

The Report

Changes to plan since October ARC meeting

4. The re-prioritised plan approved by the ARC is attached as appendix 1.

Core Internal Aud
5. The following audits have been re-instated at the ARC’s request:

« Agents Remuneration - Assess interim controls;

* Client Settlements — Assess interim controls;

e Payroll - Do a full audit;

e Procure to Pay - Review the key controls once the remedial actions from the
procurement fraud investigation are complete. The current schedule and
progress with remedial actions may result in this audit being deferred to Q1 of
2019/20.

6. The following audit was added to the plan at management’s request:
e Network and SGEI Reporting (including Network Subsidy).

Change Assurance:

7. We provide assurance over Post Office’s change portfolio through a dynamic
programme of change assurance reviews, which includes thematic (governance)
reviews as well as reviews of individual programmes. This approach was approved
by the ARC in March 2018 with a target of 10 reviews for 2018/19.

8. The audit programme is being reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis to reflect
the programmes most deserving of independent assurance, predominantly
‘Platinum’ projects. The portfolio has been under review since August 2018 with a
number of initiatives being re-assessed. This has led to some being delayed
(Digital Identity) while others were cancelled (i.e. Closed Cash) or are still under
review (i.e. Payment Technology Upgrade). Other initiatives have been re-scoped,
changing their significance and risk profile, and we are currently assessing whether
a review should still be done (i.e. Mails On-line).

9. As a result of this continuous re-assessment, we have made the following changes
to the programme (for a full list of change assurance reviews refer to appendix 1):

e Removed Closed Cash as project was cancelled.

e Added a review of the Deployment of One Best Way (the updated change
methodology delivered by the Change Excellence programme (prev. Trafalgar)).

e Added programme review of ‘P2C Belfast Exit’ (moving data storage from the
Belfast data centre into the Azure Cloud). We are assessing the nature and
timing of a review of this significant programme. Estimated total programme
cost will be £37m - £46m with predicted benefits of £12.5 - £15m. Current RAG
status is amber.

Resourcing
10. Internal Audit is now fully resourced. The two remaining vacancies were filled in
November:

e Charlotte Webster joined the team as the internal audit manager for Financial
Services and Telecoms. Charlotte will also be the designated Chief Internal
Auditor for POI.

e Jonathan Acres was appointed as senior IT auditor.

POMS Audit Plan

11. POL Internal Audit is also responsible for delivery of the audit plan for Post Office
Insurance (POMS). Progress with the 2018/19 audit plan is reported at the POMS
ARC. Three of the five audits on the plan are now complete or underway:

e Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) - Readiness Review (Complete)
« Oversight of Appointed Representatives (Complete)
« Nemesis Project - Programme assurance (Fieldwork)

Internal audit reviews completed

12. Since the October ARC meeting we have finalised the following five reviews:
« Employee Expenses
e Whistleblowing Process
« Month-end Close Process
« Investment Funding Controls
« Procurement Fraud Investigation

Our findings and observations are summarised below (the full reports are available
in Diligent’s reading room):

Employee Expenses (Ref. 2018/19-02)

An audit of employee expenses was scheduled for 2018/19. An
employee fraud, identified in March 2018, identified potential abuse of
Corporate Procurement Cards (CPCs) and as a result management
requested that the audit be accelerated and for controls over
procurement cards to be included in the scope.

The audit was initially undertaken from May to July 2018. At the time

eon of clearing the draft report in October 2018, management requested
ameron / that we undertake further work to investigate unusual purchases made
Mo Kang through procurement cards.

We would like to highlight that management have pro-actively taken

Audit actions: ;
steps to improve the controls over employee expenses and CPCs before

6 the start of this audit, however, they recognised that more work was
1 required and believed that an audit would support them to quickly
0 address control weaknesses. The audit identified a number of significant
control weaknesses that exposed PO to the risk of fraud, error and non-
compliance. As a result we assessed the control environment at the time

of the audit as ‘unacceptable’.

Specifically we have identified the following control themes that
required urgent remediation (remedial actions were rapidly
implemented, even while the audit was still underway):

1. Policies not fit for purpose, or in need of improvement (for Travel
& Expenses, Gifts & Hospitality and CPCs).

2. The quality assurance process for employee expenses was not
replicated when the new system was implemented in January
2018. This was not an omission, but an operational decision
discussed at GE. Anomalies and errors found by the audit
confirmed the need to re-instate independent checking and
validation.

3. Incorrect configuration when Selenity was implemented in January
2018 resulted in expense claims for Group Executives not being
reviewed and approved by a person of appropriate seniority or
delegate.

4. There was no requirement or process for receipts to be submitted
for CPC transactions.

5. The audit findings highlighted the need for a programme of training
and/or increased awareness for employees regarding the
compliant spending of company funds.

We emphasise that no instances of fraud or wilful abuse were found (we
tested a representative sample, including data analytics of 100% of 12
months’ transactions). At the time of writing this report, 3 out of the 6
P1 actions were already complete, with the remaining 3 P1 actions on
track for completion by 28 February. It is our view that completion of
these actions will significantly reduce the risks identified by the audit.

Management Comment provided by Al Cameron

When the Paul Swanton fraud was identified I said to the ARC that controls over employee expenses
had not yet been prioritised on our controls agenda, as we focused on financial reporting and IT.
Given the identification of a material fraud, I felt we had to accelerate our assessment and while we
would normally prefer to review and fix before an audit, in this case it would be helpful to get an audit
assessment straight away.

The audit has taken longer than planned because I asked for additional work to give us more clarity
and evidence on whether other fraudulent behaviour had taken place. That has been done and I would
like to thank the internal audit team for their hard work.

There is no evidence of fraud and that is positive. The Finance Directors get data on and review travel
spend to ensure it is at a sensible level and we are not losing material cost savings.

As we expected, the control environment was not strong enough and there was widespread non-
compliance. Angela was already reviewing the expenses policy and some of the areas where we were
non-compliant were logical and we have acknowledged that by changing specific elements of the
policy.

We had previously taken out a team checking receipts and asked individuals and their managers to
take responsibility. That hasn’t been working well and we have re-instituted some sample checks in
HRSC.

The availability of Corporate Credit cards had previously been reduced but at the time we could not
institute the right controls under the provider contract. We have now been through the process to
identify a new provider, with controls in place and the service is currently in transition.

This has been a helpful review that has enabled some rapid improvements.

Whistleblowing Process (Ref. 2018/19-11)

The objective of this audit was to assess the design and operating
effectiveness of the controls over the Whistleblowing process. The audit
assessed the following scope areas:

* Governance arrangements.
« Staff awareness and understanding.
e Managing whistleblowing concerns.

Audit actions: improved since they assumed responsibility a year ago. Further
0 improvements highlighted by the review, will help ensure that Post

Office colleagues have confidence to use the process when appropriate.
The three P2 findings relate to:

* Absence of a mechanism to confirm and measure staff awareness
of the whistleblowing arrangements and to gauge the success of
awareness campaigns.

« No targeted training provided to staff who are responsible to
investigate whistleblowing reports.

«Lack of root cause analysis and action plans to address recurring
cases.

Management Comment provided by Jane MacLeod

Post Office takes seriously its obligations to provide a safe and confidential framework within which
whistleblowing reports can be made. The improvements identified by the audit are helpful and will
be addressed to ensure that all Post Office employees and those others to whom the policy applies,
feel able to report instances of wrongdoing or other behaviours which do not meet Post Office’s
standards.

Month-end Close Process (Ref. 2018/19-12)

An audit of the Month-end Close process was originally scheduled for
2019/20 as part of the 3-year rotational audit programme of core
processes. However, the audit has been brought forward to the current
year in response to the issues experienced with the reporting of
Telecoms revenue at the 2017/18 year-end.

o We conclude that the Month-end processes are operating effectively and
1 the control environment has been further strengthened to ensure
2 accurate representation of the financial position. We have therefore

We further note that since the introduction of the Financial Controls
Framework programme in 2016/17 there has been continuous
improvement on the monitoring and reporting of the Month-end Close
Process with increased attention since the 2017/18 year-end.

Management Comment provided by Al Cameron

Good to see the progress made and we will take forward the helpful additional actions.

Investment Funding Controls (Ref. 2018/19-16)

UKGI have raised concerns over the robustness of Post Office’s
oversight and control of the Strategic Plan’s implementation and
accuracy of the quarterly progress reports in support of funding draw
downs. Internal Audit were asked to review and assess the key portfolio
level processes and controls, including those governing the reporting of
progress and funding.

Management have previously recognised that significant improvement
is required to improve the maturity and effectiveness of controls over
its change portfolio. A series of initiatives, both short term tactical and

Sponsor:
Rob Houghton

Audit actions: long term strategic, were set in motion through the Change Excellence
0 programme (previously called Trafalgar). Nonetheless, this review
4 highlighted further areas for improvement:
T e Process and control inefficiencies in the management of
programmes at portfolio level;
5 « Roles and Responsibilities not clearly defined; further improvements

required to ensure effective monitoring of programmes at portfolio
level;

¢ Current benefit modelling and reporting is not appropriate for
programmes delivered under an Agile methodology.

The audit also identified some deficiencies in the controls over the
preparation of the quarterly report to UKGI, particularly with regard to
cost and benefit forecasts. The noted deficiencies had a minor impact
on the Q3 report, however, we emphasise that the report was not
materially impacted by these weaknesses and we confirm the accuracy
of reporting of actual cost.

We have rated this report ‘Needs Improvement’ as there are some
process and control weaknesses that, if not addressed, may result in
inaccurate reporting in future.

Management Comment provided by Rob Houghton

The challenges on change delivery were already recognised and a programme established to improve
controls, transition to agile method and improve delivery. The audit was commissioned in the middle
of this work. This audit is therefore timely as the incremental improvements identified are already
added to the scope of the work.

Procurement Fraud Investigation (Ref. 2018/19-03)

Post Office have experienced a significant, systematic, employee
fraud, committed by a senior person in a position of trust (total value
in excess of £300k). Management requested that Internal Audit

Not Rated conduct an investigation to understand the control failures that have
allowed this fraud to take place. One element of the fraud (to the
value of £49k) was committed through the company’s procurement

Sponsor: process, hence this investigation focused on the controls around the
Al Cameron purchase to pay process.

. ‘ . We conclude that the individual was able to commit this fraud by
Audit actions: abusing his seniority and level of trust within the organisation and by

4 colluding with a supplier. He is being prosecuted for his activities and
has cooperated fully with the investigatory work.

0 Some inherent weaknesses in the current process and outdated

4 procurement system have contributed to the fraud being committed
and not being detected. Replacing the system was not an IT priority,

however, management have recognised the risks associated with the
current system and this is reflected in the Post Office risk analysis.
Management is currently looking at options to replace the outdated
procurement system, which will significantly improve the control
environment. As an interim measure, management have agreed to
additional actions (some already completed) to further mitigate the
risk of similar fraud being committed. We have no reason to believe
that other instances of fraud took place.

This was a specific piece of work, targeted on the fraud. As the work
was investigatory in nature the report has not been rated. The
investigation will inform a more comprehensive review of the
procurement process, which is scheduled for Q4 2018/19 or Q1
2019/20.

be limited.

This was a helpful review and it is positive that no further instances of fraud have been identified.
As we know our controls over procurement have been limited by the legacy systems. We have been
working for some time on a replacement system, with a RFP on design and cost already in the
market. The decision to invest may well rest on the control benefits as the pure financial case may
