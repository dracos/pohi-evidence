AP010800 I Arrange for Reference Data to change AW Open
1 the medium name for Settle Centrally
AP010800 I Check that Gary Blackburn has all the SW Open
2 relevant information in relation to the
2™ bug that occurred in January. This is
where ‘abort’ during rollover created
discrepancies.
AP010800 I Provide detailed explanation of the MS I have checked this out Open
3 issue that impacted Craigpark BIM BE- and we have seen this
0158102. happen only 3 times in
the life of TP since S90
(2 years +) and it has
happened Twice at
Craigpark once which
was benign. It was
decided at the time that
there could be a fix
introduced (I understand
what is being proposed
for the bug fix and if it
were to go wrong could
impact the whole estate
so avoiding such a fix
sounds like the correct
decision).
AP010800 I AW to provide SW the communications I AW Open
4 that he has in relation to discrepancies
caused by software changes.
AP010800 I Get advice from the POL legal teamin I SW Open
