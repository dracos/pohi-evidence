Post Office considered Horizon IT
system ‘high risk’, court told

The Post Office considered Horizon a high operational risk in an internal review, a
trial focused on alleged fallibilities in the system used in thousands of Post Office
branches has heard

By Karl Flinders, Chief reporter and senior editor EMEA Published: 12 Mar 2019 8:30

As the court battle between subpostmasters and the Post Office resumed in a
second trial, documents revealed that the computer system at the centre of the

dispute was considered high risk.

The court heard that an internal
Post Office review found that its IT
was not fit for purpose and would be

expensive and difficult to change.

More than 500 subpostmasters are
suing the Post Office through the
Bates versus Post Office group
litigation order (GLO).

In 2009, Computer Weekly revealed that the lives of some subpostmasters, who run
Post Office branches, were turned upside down as a result of being fined, sacked,
made bankrupt and even imprisoned because of unexplained accounting
shortfalls. Some claimants were sent to prison, one while pregnant. They blame the
accounting and retail system they use, known as Horizon, for the problems. The

Post Office denies this.

Horizon, which was introduced in 1999/2000, is used by nearly 12,000 post office
branches. Subpostmasters are held liable for any unexplained losses (see timeline

below).

Citing Post Office documents, Patrick Green QC, representing subpostmasters, said
the Post Office had stated in public that plans to replace Horizon had nothing to do
with dissatisfaction or lack of confidence in the system. He said it stated this was

because its current contract was coming to an end.

But a Post Office review of its IT, also revealed in court, categorised the Horizon
branch system as being of “high operational risk”. This was the middle level of three

categories, between “severe risk” and “within appetite but attention required”.

Known errors of Horizon system

In preparation for the trial, a document known as the known errors log was
disclosed, revealing thousands of errors that the Post Office and Fujitsu knew about
but did not inform the subpostmaster network of. One known error, which featured
heavily on day one of the trial, was first made public by Computer Weekly in
November 2015.

The issue, which has become known as the Dalmellington case, named after the
branch, involved an incident in which thousands of pounds’ worth of payments were
duplicated for one subpostmaster. If undetected, this would have appeared as a loss
when the accounts were completed, which would be the responsibility of the

subpostmaster.

The problem, which was investigated by the Communications Workers Union (CWU)
postmaster branch, involves the process where subpostmasters transfer money
from a core Post Office branch to a remote branch created to serve rural areas,
known as an outreach, which is basically a branch on a laptop. These processes are

known as remittances.

It occurred because a subpostmaster

sent. As a result, four payments of £8,000 Fujitsu knew about but

did not inform the
stmaster network

repeatedly pressed the command to send a

transaction because the screen didn’t

were recorded as being sent from a remote
branch to a central branch, but only one was
recorded as received. Accounts showed the

subpostmaster was £24,000 short.

In an email at the time, an Atos representative said: “This issue is caused by the
user forcing log-off when the post-login checks have not fully completed. We have
experienced previous instances of this issue in other branches [that] have been

caused in the same way (forced log-off).”

Pressure exerted by campaigners following the Computer Weekly article led to the

Post Office investigating the matter.

Helen Baker, president of the postmaster branch at the CWU at the time, was
contacted by the subpostmaster at Dalmellington when the accounting shortfall

appeared. At the time, she alerted Computer Weekly to the issue.

Following day one of the latest trial, Baker told Computer Weekly that when the
subpostmaster involved contacted her for help, she looked into the records and
identified what had happened. Subpostmasters generally do not have the training to
spot things like this, she said, although the accounts shortfall is their responsibility.
“Most subpostmasters do not know where to look or what to look for when there is a

shortfall,” she said.

Without help, said Baker, this type of loss might not be noticed until much later. She
said if the subpostmaster at Dalmellington, Ann Ireland, hadn't acted quickly, there
would have been an apparent loss that she would have found it difficult to explain at

a later date.

She added that subpostmasters are told by the Post Office that they do not need to
balance once a week, but only once a month, whereas her own advice is to “do it

straight away when you make a transaction’.

In relation to the Dalmellington bug, Antony de Garr Robinson QC, acting for the
Post Office, said in court that the Post Office had got to the bottom of what had
happened.

“They identified 112 potential branches with financial impact, 108 of which had been
fixed or made good. Of the other four, only two had a significant problem, and further
research showed that those two branches were not actually affected by the
Dalmellington bug at all, they just had similar symptoms that were the result of an

entirely separate cause and that were fixed entirely separately,” he said.

He said Dalmellington-type problems would be picked up by Post Office teams

before a subpostmaster lost money.

Post Office kept quiet about IT errors
The first trial in November focused on the contractual relationship between the Post

Office and the subpostmasters who manage its local branches.

But the computer system's alleged faults were a constant theme during the trial. For

example, documents referred to in court revealed evidence of a known problem with

Horizon described by the Post Office and its IT partner Fujitsu.

A Post Office internal memo from August 2010, referred to in court and

entitled Receipts payments mismatch issue memo day 1 OP_0008387, revealed

that discrepancies showing at the Horizon counter disappear when the branch

follows certain process steps, but will still show in the back-end branch account.

The memo added that this issue could be damaging if revealed. “If widely known, it
could cause a loss of confidence in the Horizon system,” the memo said. “There
could be a potential impact upon ongoing legal cases where branches are disputing
the integrity of Horizon data. It could provide branches with ammunition to blame

Horizon for future discrepancies.”

During cross-examination, Post Office director Angela van den Bogerd admitted that

the Horizon IT system had made mistakes, which the Post Office was responsible

for correcting, but said the Post Office did not necessarily have to tell its
subpostmaster network about the errors. Van den Bogerd said the Post Office could

have told subpostmasters about the errors, but did not.
