Alice, I hope you have had a great weekend! The Stones and Andy Murray winning Wimbledon - they don't get much
better!

In between some rest, we have been working v hard on the statement and the report. Attached is our latest statement,
which responds to the report, which I shall mail shortly. Mark and Martin have produced their usual high standards of
editing and I am now comfortable with it. We have decided to take the welcome it/collaborative approach but have made
the reliability of Horizon the main intro. As in fact the report now does.

I have exchanged texts with Alan Bates and sent him a copy of this statement. He and JA were sent the report by SS. AB
and I are speaking tomorrow at 9am and meeting at 3pm. Mark has sent a copy of the statement to Janet and I shall try
to get a call with James as well. I texted OL but not heard back (possible it is no longer the same no., of course), so we
will go via his office tomorrow and I'll offer a call.

No counting chickens yet. But some good work under our belts.

I think I shall update the Board after the AB phone call Monday am - is that ok?

BW Paula

Ps. The delight of Andy Murray's win was clouded momentarily by a commentary that "the new CEO of the LTA (shortly

to be announced) would now have one of the best jobs in the world of sport: the popularity of tennis will go sky high!"
MG's other offer we think was the LTA. (We will speak tomorrow - he wanted the weekend to consider.)
