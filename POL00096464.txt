Jarnail, as discussed. the conclusion reached by Fujitsu, Gareth Jenkins. I suspect that counsel just
wants Fujitsu to say their systems work well and not to comment further. But the conclusion does not
seem helpful. Please direct advice and any questions to Andy Bolc who is in touch with our agents
and counsel. It seems last PTR directed case not to be listed before 18th May with 4 day estimate.

Hi Andy

Hope you had a nice break. Please see the emails below re: Chris Bramwell. I have spoken to Steve Bradshaw about
this case, he has said that an expert's report was supposed to be served on the Sth April 2012, but he wasn't aware of this
until it was almost too late, I think he said that he cobbled something together and served it on the court. However since
then he has received the report (see attached). I think we should serve this as additional evidence, but we may need to
tweak it so that it complies with CPR 33.3 ie qualifications, etc - what do you think?

Steve has also been asked by Susan Cavender - who I believe is the pros. barrister instructed by Stone King solicitors, for
a further s.9 statement from Linda Collard, but he doesn't know what Susan wants him to cover in the further s.9
statement - do you know what it might be? I can't find any names of lawyers on Stone King Sols website.

If you could let me know what your thoughts are on the attached report, and also what the s.9 should cover that would be
great so I can update Steve Bradshaw. If you need any help with anything, just let me know, although I will be in the
printers for the rest of the afternoon.

Susan
Please see e mail received from Gareth JENKINS (Fujitsu expert) — not sure if this has arrived too late?
Rachael

Please see above as discussed. I would be grateful if you could find out what further statements are required and also do
we have any indication of what witnesses are required for the trial on 27 April 2012 so that I can keep on top of keeping
them informed etc.

Anything else give us a call or e mail
Thanks

Steve

Jane / Jason,
I was asked a couple of weeks ago about papers covering Horizon integrity.
i have a coupe of such papers and it has now been agreed I can pass them on to you:

1. Horizon Integrity
2. Horizon Online integrity

POL-0096047
POLO00096464
POL00096464

Hope they are what the Barrister is after.
Note that Bishops Hull migrated from Horizon to Horizon Online overnight on 31" August / 1* September

Ihave started my analysis of the logs, but have quite a bit more to do. I won’t have anything to add to my report until
next week at the earliest. I don’t know how this fits in with court dates as I thought there was a deadline for tomorrow.

You should also be aware that I am on leave from 14" to 18 May {inclusive} and probably again for 2 weeks in
September (but nothing booked yet).

Regards

Gareth

Thank you for the update. I have forwarded your email to Jason as Graham has now moved from this team and I am unsure who will
be picking this case up.

Jane,
I received an electronic version of the Defence Expert’s report this morning.

I have gone through it and made some comments (using word revisions) based purely on the statements in the report which you
may find of use.

In summary, I agree with his conclusions.

Penny has also passed me ARQ data from 10/2/10 to 12/11/10 (which I think is what the Defence has analysed and also 1/7/09 to
9/2/10.

I will have a look at that data and see if I can come up with an analysis of Cash Declarations and Cash Movements which I can then
use to check the detailed examples in the report. However I am unlikely to come up with anything that contradicts the basic
conclusion which is:

1. The money appears to be missing at the Audit
2. The cash control in the branch is abysmal
3. No real indication of when money was taken or by whom

Is there anything specifically you want me to look for?

Regards

Gareth
