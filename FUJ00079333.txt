Steve,

As a group we need to address your concerns. Can you please add these to the migration meeting you are calling for
the week I return from leave.

Steve, I share your concerns regarding counter performance and code regression. To that end we are focussing on
those areas of functionality where we appear to be experiencing performance degradation and attempting to establish
where the problem lies. I have been personally aware of these problems for several weeks and would not expect CS
to authorise Cl4 unless these issues were resolved. I have raised the issue of extra work during weekly balancing with
Mike who will be discussing it with Dave Smith. This has been introduced by POCL to support LFS.

I cannot give you a 100% guarantee that code regression will not occur at Cl4 because by its very nature it is not fully
automated and never will be. However, our end to end processes are designed to reduce the possibility of this
occuring to an absolute minimum and I have recently requested a reconciliation where it is possible to do so.

I also have no faith in PO backfill training but I'm not sure how I can help mitigate the risk. PO have an obligation to
understand the implications on the counter of all the changes they have requested and ensure that the staff are
informed and trained appropriately.

Mike / Terry,
Please see below, report from Pat Lywood on Cl4 implementation.

I am particularly concerned with the risks of degraded counter and cash account performance and of code
regression between Cl3 and Ci4. Also, given the dependence on PO Backfill Training but without the benefit of
experience of PONU's track record on this activity - there must be significantly increased risk that HSH
performance against SLAs will be severely impaired.

Subject: Current issue on Cl4 EPOSS.

All,

The following details were supplied by Phil Hemmingway at a Cl4 implementation meeting on 26" April.

This email details of the current issues of which Phil is aware.

CI3 to Cl4 outlet transition

The Cl4 system may prevent transactions that Cl3 would have allowed. Having migrated the datacentre
to Cl4 and while migrating the outlets to Cl4 the system may send CI3 transactions to TIP which would
not be allowed under Cl4 rules.

TIP are aware of this and these transactions should not be rejected.

Incorrect Outlet transaction modes

The Cl4 system may prevent transactions that Cl3 would have allowed. This could result in a post master
being unable to transact a product that he could transact the day before he was migrated to Cl4.

This could result in a number of calls to the helpdesk and will not necessarily be noticed the day after
migration.

I will be following this up with Dave Wilcox and Duncan MacDonald to see if any checks can be done prior
to the upgrade to assess the potential size of the problem.

Paul Westfield and I will ensure this is included in the backfill training provided to the existing offices.

Balancing process overheads

After migration to Cl4 a new process is introduced to the cash account process. Every office will be
required to declare non-value stock. If the office fails to do this process he will not be able to balance or
complete the cash account.

Paul Westfield and I will ensure this is included in the backfill training provided to the existing offices.

I will contact Phil Hemmingway to see if the system could prompt the user the first time a cash account is
attempted on Cl4 to remind him of the new requirement.

This could cause an increased workload at HSH.

Performance issue

The Cl4 counter is currently perceived to be taking longer to 1) produce the cash account, 2) transact a
product; 3) go from ‘settle’ to the return point. These are under investigation by development and James
Stinchcombe. I believe they have a plan of investigation for each of these items.

This must be resolved by development in order for CS to authorise Cl4 to live.

Risk of code regression

There may be fixes that have been produced and delivered into CI3 that have been missed from Cl4.

I will take this up with Dave Royle and ask for assurance that all clone pinicls have been tested. I will
supply a list of the pinicls that we have tested in CI3R release.

Riposte 223 usability

The session and transaction id formats change at Cl4. The Cl4 code will accept both formats but if
referring to a CI3 transaction then the CI3 format MUST be used and if referring to a Cl4 transaction then
FUJ00079333
FUJ00079333

a Cl4 format MUST be used.
This will only impact the postmaster in the early life of Cl4.
Paul Westfield and I will ensure this is included in the backfill training provided to the existing offices.
This could cause an increased workload at HSH.
I will keep you informed of progress on the above.

Phil - Please let me know if I have got some of the technical detail wrong or have misrepresented your
presentation.

Regards

Pat
