Subject: Checking ARQ Events Ve

Pete,
I'm not sure that I’m the best person to be checking through the ARQ events for Penny.

I think it would be better if you arranged with Mik for SSC to do this as part of there normal activities. Presumably they
were doing this while I was on leave, but now that I’m back Steven has started sending them back to me.

I'm happy to advise on specific questions, but I think SSC have a better detailed knowledge of what causes these
events and what are known to be benign than I have. They also have processes in place to cover for leave etc.

Regards
Gareth
