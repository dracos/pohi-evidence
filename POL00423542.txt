Accountability

Section Total

61%

Considers the roles different individuals have and their engagement with the whistleblowing

arrangements. Clear accountability structures will help staff better understand their roles in
relation to the whistleblowing arrangements. Active engagement from senior leaders may
improve staff trust and confidence in your whistleblowing arrangements.

Recommendation

You have a good score in this area. In order to improve on this score in line with best practice,
you need to show how senior leaders within your organisation engage with the whistleblowing
arrangements and actively demonstrate a commitment to workers raising concerns without fear
of reprisal. You also need to ensure that designated personnel (for example the whistleblowing

champion and team) clearly understand their roles and responsibilities.

Governance

—— Written Policy & Procedures ———

Section Total

86%

A well drafted whistleblowing policy helps to provide staff with a clear understanding of what
whistleblowing is and the processes by which an individual can raise and/or escalate a concern.
It will also provide staff with assurances about victimisation and confidentiality.

Recommendation

You have achieved a good score in this area and there are no specific recommendations at this
stage.

Review & Reporting

Section Total

59%

Considers the processes by which you review and report on whistleblowing arrangements.
Conducting reviews enables organisations to practically see whether whistleblowing
arrangements are effective in practice and action learning points.

Recommendation

You have achieved a good score in this area but additional work should be considered to
strengthen governance. When reviewing the arrangements, recommendations should be
assigned ownership with a timeline for completion. Serious concems raised and positive
outcomes from whistleblowing cases should be reported to the Board. These should be redacted
in order to protect the identity of the whistleblower. You could consider incorporating an overview
of management information on whistleblowing in published data e.g. annual reports.

— Communications ——
Section Total

30%

Engaging regularly with staff is essential to building a strong speak up culture. Staff will not have
confidence in whistleblowing arrangements if they are not aware of them.

Recommendation

This section requires improvement. We recommend that you review your communications
materials to ensure that you engage with different staff groups and cultures. Messages
encouraging staff to raise concerns might be included in various media such as posters and staff
training. Finally, think about how you test staff awareness and confidence in the whistleblowing
arrangements (for example by using staff surveys, focus groups and exit interviews)

Engagement

Training

Section Total

8%

Clear and detailed training on whistleblowing provides your workforce with a good understanding
of arrangements. Training can help embed the importance of whistleblowing and key policy
messages.

Recommendation

This section requires improvement. We recommend that staff, designated managers and line
managers receive in-depth training on whistleblowing. In most circumstances line managers or
named designated contacts are the first people to receive a whistleblowing concern. Accordingly,
line managers should receive appropriate training in order to accurately identify concerns and
effectively handle the individual raising the concern. This minimises the likelihood that concerns
will be escalated further and helps make best use of your resources. You may wish to review
how you provide training to your workforce (e.g. instructor led by e-learning).

— Support & Protection

Section Total

41%

Considers internal processes in place for supporting and protecting staff who raise
whistleblowing concerns. Implementing effective processes for managing confidentiality and
victimisation will help to ensure staff are appropriately supported and protected when they raise
concerns. Implementing clear policy messaging and protocols for supporting and protecting staff
who raise concerns is essential.

Recommendation

This section requires improvement. We recommend that you operate multiple support networks
within your organisation to enable whistleblowers to seek support when raising concerns (such
as whistleblowing advocates trade unions and Employee Assistance Programs). Consider how
you ensure that confidentiality is maintained throughout the whistleblowing process. You should
ensure the risk of victimisation is considered in each whistleblowing case and that appropriate
safeguards are put in place to prevent this. Finally, you should ensure that any settlement
agreement that you have with staff clearly states that nothing in the agreement prevents staff
from making a whistleblowing disclosure.

Operations

Recording & Investigation

Section Total

56%

This section considers the processes by which you record and investigate concerns. Having
clear processes and principles for recording and investigating concerns will help to ensure
consistency in handling a whistleblower.

Recommendation

You have achieved a good score in this area. We recommend that you periodically review
management information to ensure consistency of processes in recording concerns. You should
ensure that investigation guidance is clear on the key principles that are to be followed when
whistleblowing concerns are investigated (such as confidentiality, competence and
independence). You should ensure that an independent internal function conducts periodic
reviews of your investigations, to ensure that the principles have been followed.

—— Resolution & Feedback ———

Section Total

18%

This looks at your processes for resolving concerns and how you provide feed receiving
feedback from whistleblowers. Clear processes on feedback after the investigation will help give
your staff confidence that their concerns have been addressed.

Recommendation

This section requires improvement. We recommend that you implement standard processes for
resolving any substantiated concerns. Where possible ensure that you provide feedback to
whistleblowers on the outcome of concerns that are raised (subject to limitations imposed by
confidentiality). Consider how you seek feedback from whistleblowers at the end of the process
and use this information to improve your arrangements.

Thank you for completing
the Benchmark 110 I

We hope this self-assessment 360° Benchmark report proves valuable in your efforts to
strengthen your whistleblowing arrangements. You should read the recommendations of this

in other areas of your whistleblowing arrangements.

Protect can also independently verify your score by reviewing your current whistleblowing
arrangements. By having your scores independently verified by Protect, we will be able to
confirm the accuracy of your scores and help you to identify and implement any necessary
improvements in line with industry best practice and provide a bespoke action plan for
improvement.

Should you wish to discuss any points, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
