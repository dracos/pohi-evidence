1. Service Summary

1.1. The Engineering Service comprises an on-site replacement or repair service, together with
associated backup, support and administrative functions, for Counter Equipment at Branches
and other designated Post Office locations, including Counter Training Offices (CTOs or Head
Office Counter Positions. Where possible the Service Desk will provide resolution of Hardware
faults, however any Hardware faults which cannot be resolved will be passed to the
Engineering Service to initiate deployment of a Fujitsu Services Support Engineer with the
exception of certain Bar Code Reader calls whereby the Postmaster will have the option of
selecting a postal fix which will be managed via the Service Desk. Please see
(SVM/SDM/SD/0001) for details on process.

1.2. On-site replacement or repair for the PostShop Branch Infrastructure is defined within the
Contract Controlled Document (CCD) entitled: “Service Integration Service, Service
Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0010).This document and service is currently in the process of
being withdrawn.

1.3. The Engineering Service shall comprise the following elements:
(a) On-site replacement of faulty Counter Equipment;
(b) Repair and recycling of faulty Counter Equipment;
(c) Limited Hardware asset tracking — base units only;
(d) Local Area Network (LAN) support;
(e) Portable Appliance Testing (PAT); and

(f) I Service Management.

1.4. Fujitsu Services Support Engineers will be appropriately trained and the Engineering Service
shall include the use of Technical Couriers where Fujitsu Services considers it is appropriate
for such Technical Couriers to carry out the Engineering Service.

1.5. Maintenance and repair of the Counter Equipment involving on-site attendance at Post Office
premises by Fujitsu Services Support Engineers shall not interfere unduly with the ability of a
Branch to serve Customers, even where the Branch has only a single Counter Position and/or
extremely limited physical space.

Fujitsu Services shall carry out visits for maintenance or repair in accordance with the SLTs described
within section 2.3.5 of this Engineering Service, Service Description. However, the Branch Manager may
elect to defer a visit to a more convenient time and where practical it will be accommodated. For
example, in a larger Branch, if a fault occurs at the busiest time of day then the Branch Manager may
specify the earliest start time from which Fujitsu Services may carry out the maintenance or repair. In
such circumstances, the request for service shall be diagnosed fully but not carried out until after the
Branch Manager's preferred time of attendance. In this case the time in suspension shall not count
towards downtime as defined within section 2.3.5 of this Engineering Service, Service Description.

For the Epson counter printer:

1. Up to and including August 2010, the excess swap calculation shall be based on the
original baseline MTBF with a 20% degradation allowed for.

2. At the end of August 2010, the calculation of the MTBF as described in section 2.2 of this
CCD shall be waived and a new baseline MTBF shall be introduced based on the rolling
MTBF as it is calculated for the month of May 2010 (i.e. 7.37).

3. From September 2010 onwards, the excess swap calculation shall be based on the new
baselined MTBF as reset in point 2 above (i.e. 7.37) but with a 50% degradation allowed
for.

This is also covered in more detail in “Calculating Mean Time Between Failure and Availability”
(SVM/SDM/PRO/0013)

The Service Desk Service also provide a postal support service for Bar Code Reader calls as an
alternative to sending the call to engineering. Where this service is requested by the Postmaster, the
replacement part is mailed to branch for the Postmaster to install themselves rather than by sending an
engineer. This is covered by CCN1301b. Assuming that the criteria laid out as per the CCN are met,
then each call which is resolved via this method rather than using the engineering service will invoke a
credit which will be paid to POL monthly at the level described at that time.

2.7.1.2 OBC (Branch Change) Service

The Engineering Service supports the OBC (Branch Change) Service. If the scope of the Engineering
Service changes, the alternative Service Provider will support the OBC (Branch Change) Service.

meeting the contractual Security Requirements, and in assisting with any audit requirements.

2.7.1.5 Management Information Service

The Management Information Service may request data to support MIS Reports delivered internally
within Fujitsu Services or to Post Office. If the scope of the Engineering Service changed, the Service
Management Service may have to take over this role.

the Engineering Service will only be initiated by a fault reported to the Service Desk by either
Post Office, the Branch or internal Fujitsu Services delivery departments.

2.8.2 Post Office will provide the Fujitsu Services Support Engineer access to the Branch within the
agreed access times as agreed between the Service Desk and the caller. Post Office
