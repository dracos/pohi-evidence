0.4 Abbreviations/Definitions

(Abbreviation

[Definition

[Authorised Client
\Transaction Awaiting
(Confirmation (ACTAC)

[From a ‘Client’ perspective, a transaction that has been authorised
lbut within the NBE has not yet been matched with the Counter
(Confirmation. This signifies projected settlement awaiting the
(Confirmed Client Transaction. From a system perspective, an ‘S’
itransaction.

(Column Date

[For Reports NB101a and NB101b the Reconciliation Date applicableI
jto each column of the reports.

(Confirmed Client
\Transaction (CCT)

From a ‘Client’ perspective, a transaction that has been authorised to
either debit or credit an account. From a system perspective, a ‘C4’
itransaction.

(Counter Confirmations

[From an outlet / PON perspective, a successfully completed
transaction at the counter. From a system perspective, a ‘C12’
itransaction.

IExceptioned Client
\Transaction (ECT)

From a Client perspective, a transaction reconciliation difference
ighlighted within the NBE and notified to Horizon. From a system
erspective, a ‘D’ transaction.

[Exception Types

IWithin all reports the ‘Exceptions’ category will include:

le ‘Incomplete States’, i.e. those transactions where one or more
transaction component is missing — a C4 without a C12 etc

le Genuine exceptions where transaction components belonging to
the same high level transaction have been exceptioned, i.e. C12
(amount) not = to C4 (amount) etc.

le NBE/ DRS corruption’s

‘New’ Transactions

\Transactions that have had a change of state since they were last
reported, or have never been reported except in NB102 section 11.

ote that if a transaction appears in NBO12 section 11 it is future
\dated as is reported in that section for information only. Once future
\dated transactions become current dated, they must be reported as
thought they have not appeared on the reports before.

‘Old’ Transactions

(Transactions that have NOT had a change of state since they were
llast reported.

[Reconciliation Date

IThe Reconciliation Date is the date attributed to a transaction to
allow PON to reconcile. It will be set the first available Bank
Settlement date from the transaction elements (C112, C12, C4, S &
ID) that make up a Network Banking transaction. If no Bank
Settlement date is available, the Reconciliation Date will be set to the’
processing date that the Data Reconciliation Service first recorded

ny element of the transaction being received. If a Settlement date
subsequently becomes available, the first available Bank Settlement
\date will replace the processing date. However, once a transaction
lhas been accounted for on the reconciliation reports, the
[Reconciliation Date will never change.

[Routing Gateway

[This refers to the Routing_Gateway as defined in Network Banking

Settlement Date Settlement Date is often the same as Run Date but some Financial
Institutions will assign a Settlement Date in the future: e.g. the

Introduction

This document has been compiled to specify all ICL Pathway outputs from the Data
Reconciliation Service (DRS) to enable a generic end to end reconciliation of Network
Banking transaction processing.

All reports specified are required to ensure client transactions, counter confirmations
and Network Banking EPOSS (TIP) transactions sent to POL / TIP are completely
reconciled and any exceptions are identified and resolved.

Section 4 identifies the transaction flows within the Network Banking model

Scope

This document defines the format and content of all reconciliation reports, which
satisfy the Network Banking reconciliation requirement. It does not attempt to define
within the operating systems, including the Network Banking Engine, (NBE) how the
transactions are processed.

The following Network Banking requirements are satisfied by this document:

© Reconciliation: [NBR0040], [NBR0042], [NBR0183], [NBR0212], [NBR0227],
[NBR0229], [NBR0278], [NBR0294], [NBR0389].

© Settlement: [NBR0230], [NBR0456].

e Error Resolution: [NBR0260]

It is assumed that each of the PON clients, as dictated by Routing _Gateway (assumed
to be at this point the Banks / LINK) will require a separate reconciliation report set.

Within this report set, separate reports will be provided as per the following table:

Report Number Deposit Transactions _ [Withdrawal Transactions Balance Enquiries
(B100a Combined Report Separate Report
B100b Combined Report Separate Report
B10la Y Y Not Required
B1O1b Y Y Not Required
B102 Combined Report Not Required
B103 Y I Y Not Required

NB: Where there is either a deposit or withdrawal with balance, they are to be treated
as deposits or withdrawals without balances respectively.

The format and content of each client’s report is considered to be identical when
allowing for these specific requirements. It should therefore be understood that the
specifications documented here are applicable to each client report set. (Specific client

requirements outside of this reporting specification are not covered within this
document)

There must be a separate set of reports to provide for transactions for which the
Routing Gateway and/or Transaction Type is not known.

No report will mix currency, so if ever the transactions selected to appear on a set of
reports are not of a single currency, then a separate set of reports will be produced for
each currency. All the amounts in a single transaction will always use the same

currency

e NB100a: NBE/ DRS Reconciliation Statement

* NB100b: TIP/DRS Reconciliation Statement

e NB1Ola: Network Banking Settlement Statement <=5 days

e NBIOIb: Network Banking Settlement Statement > 5 days

e NBI02: Exception Summary

* NBI103: Settled Transaction / Cash Account Reconciliation Statement

Rows and columns are described in detail, together with the mathematical calculations
required to achieve reconciliation.

All general aspects relating to the production and transmission of the reports are
described.

This document does not attempt to define the business processes undertaken within
ICL Pathway and POL with respect to the resolution of any exceptions, which may
arise, nor does it scope the requirement for any systems that may be required to assist
in this process. This information can be found in the associated documents, reference:

e¢ NB/SPE/002: Network Banking DRS On-line Workstation Specification
NB/PRO/002: Network Banking Reconciliation & Incident Management

NB: It should be noted that where a system ‘state’ definition is quoted, this takes
precedence over any narrative which has only been provided to help understand the
business processes.

3.0 General Report Specifications

A separate set of reports is produced for each POL client as identified by the
Routing Gateway. (LINK being a single client). The specification is general to all
reports sets.

1. For volumes and values the accounting sense for reporting purposes to allow
settlement totals to be correctly derived, will be:

Absolute volume

Net value

Where no value reported show “[Currency] 0.00”
Where no volume reported show 0

2. Each report will show the following general information:

Report title — including the client name (derived from Routing_Gateway.)
Transaction Type — (if applicable)

Report ‘Run Date’ - i.e., the period for which the report refers
Production date and time

ICL Pathway report number

ICL Pathway reference and contact point

3. Where ‘Received’ and ‘Reconciliation Date’ are quoted against time parameters:

e ‘Received = New’: defines transactions that have had a change of state since
they were last reported, or have never been reported, except in NB102 section
ll

e ‘Received = Old’: defines transactions that have NOT had a change of state
since they were last reported

4. Reports: NB100a, NB100b, NB101a, NB101b, NB102, will be produced DAILY,
NB103 will be produced WEEKLY after Friday’s and prior to Saturdays TPS
processing schedule. They will be delivered by 08.00hrs the day following the Run
Date to:

e POL/ TIP gateway: The Host writes the reports to a directory. These are
picked up by FTMS and posted to the TIP gateway. (As per other Host to
external systems applications)

e ICL Pathway CS / MSU, DRS Workstation.

5. Within all reports the ‘Exceptions’ category will include:
e ‘Incomplete States’, i.e. those transactions where one or more transaction
component is missing — a C4 without a C12 ete
e Genuine exceptions where transaction components belonging to the same high
level transaction have been exceptioned, i.e. C12 (amount) not = to C4
(amount) etc.
e¢ NBE/ DRS corruption’s

6. For clarity within this document, field sizes are shown within ‘Report Layout’ and
not within the ‘Data Definition’

7. All reports are run against a consistent data set.

8. ‘Currency’ is implied by date on the basis that POL will define the cut off date
from £ Sterling to Euro.

9. All reports will be produced as ASCII text files — one for each report. The report
layout will be fixed format with space characters providing the blank space. This
will allow for ‘Excel’ input, using fixed field width facilities. The formatting (lines
& shading referred to in this document) will not be included within the file.

10. See also comments in Section 2: ‘Scope’

3.1.1

NB100a: NBE / DRS Reconciliation Statement

This report is a critical requirement as it allows the reconciliation of data between the
NBE and the DRS, giving a clear view of the number and value of exceptions at the
beginning and end of each day. It also gives an indication of the values paid / received
from the customer as compared to the values processed by the POL client.

3.1.1.1 NB100a: Rules

_

NB100a is run daily

NB100a is repeated for each Routing Gateway.

For reporting purposes only: To gain an NBE view of the client settlement position,
the ‘Matching’ process should only match ‘C4’ & ‘C12’ type transactions in their
appropriate system states, i.e. states: 2-3, 18-19, (report line 12)

For reporting purposes only:, ‘S’ type transactions in their appropriate system states
must always be exceptioned, i.e. states: 8-11, (report line 8)

For reporting purposes only: ‘D’ type transactions in states 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22,
23 will report ‘Amount_Authorised’

For reporting purposes only: for states 16 — 19, show the value of the ‘C4’

For reporting purposes only: for states E28 — E31, if the value is corrupt, use £0.00

8. For exception reporting, (report lines 1 & 12):

e For exception states E21, E22, E23, E24, E26, E33 report the DIFFERENCE in
the two values
e For state E32 show the value of the ‘C4’

NB101a: Network Banking Settlement Statement <= 5 days

This report identifies CCT, ACTAC and ECT transactions received against each
reconciliation date. The report flows across by reconciliation date with the latest
reconciliation date, i.e. the date applicable to the run date of the report, being the first
date listed.

To assist with the understanding of the report, a worked example is shown in section
3.1.3.4.

NB101a: Rules

NB10la is run daily

NB10la is repeated for each Routing Gateway

NB10la is repeated for each transaction type within Routing Gateway

For reconciliation dates more than 5 days old, use report NB101b

A reconciliation date entry must always be shown across report NB101a or

NB101b if exceptions remain.

6. Within this report, for clarity within the row titles, the following definitions will be
used:

e Confirmed Client Transactions (CCT) are defined as ‘Confirmed Txns’

e Authorised Client Transactions Awaiting Confirmation (ACTAC) are defined
as ‘Unconfirmed Txns’

e Exceptioned Client Transactions (ECT) are defined as ‘Exceptioned Txns’

7. A transaction will be posted against its reconciliation date. If it is received later
than it’s reconciliation date it will be shown as a ‘late’ transaction against this
reconciliation date on the day it is received.

8. Where an ‘Unconfirmed Txn’ (‘S’) is shown against a reconciliation date, when the
“Confirmed Txn’ (‘C4’) arrives, the ‘Unconfirmed Txn’ value will be deleted and
replaced by the C4 value within the ‘Late Confirmed Txn’ row. This concept flows
throughout the reports as transaction components are replaced during the course
of processing across a number of days.

9. For reporting purposes only:, ‘S’ type transactions in their appropriate system
states must always be exceptioned, i.e. states: 8-11

10. For reporting purposes only: ‘D’ type transactions in states 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21,
22, 23 will report ‘Amount_Authorised’

11. For exception reporting:

e For exception states E20 — E26, E32, E33 report the DIFFERENCE in the two
values

e Incomplete states 16 — 19 will report the value of the ‘C4’ if a difference exists
between the value of the ‘S’ and the ‘C4’

12. For exception state E39, always report against the reconciliation date.

NB101b: Network Banking Settlement Statement > 5 days

This report identifies CCT, ACTAC, & ECT transactions received against each
reconciliation date more than 5 days older than the run date of the report. The report
flows across by reconciliation date with the latest reconciliation date, i.e. the next
reconciliation date required following the cessation of NB10la.

For example:
The final reconciliation date listed on NB101a, report date 05/01/2001 would be
01/01/2001.

For the report date 06/01/2001, if the reconciliation date of 01/01/2001 has exceptions
outstanding, this reconciliation date would disappear.

NB1O1b is run daily

NB1OIb is repeated for each Routing_Gateway

NB1O0Ib is repeated for each transaction type within Routing_Gateway

Where there is no data to report, produce a file with report headers only

Where there are more than 5 reconciliation dates being reported, the text within the file to
be repeated indefinitely to the right.

For reconciliation dates less than 5 days old, use report NB101la

. A reconciliation date entry must always be shown across report NB101a or NB101b if

exceptions remain.

Within this report, for clarity within the row titles, the following definitions will be used:

e Confirmed Client Transactions (CCT) are defined as ‘Confirmed Txns’

e Authorised Client Transactions Awaiting Confirmation (ACTAC) are defined as
“Unconfirmed Txns’

e Exceptioned Client Transactions (ECT) are defined as ‘Exceptioned Txns’

Where an ‘Unconfirmed Txn’ (‘S’) is shown against a reconciliation date, when the

“Confirmed Txn’ (‘C4’) arrives, the ‘Unconfirmed Txn’ value will be deleted and replaced

by the C4 value within the ‘Late Confirmed Txn’ row. This concept flows throughout the

reports as transaction components are replaced during the course of processing across a

number of days.

For reporting purposes only:, ‘S’ type transactions in their appropriate system states must

always be exceptioned, i.e. states: 8-11

. For reporting purposes only: ‘D’ type transactions in states 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23

will report ‘Amount_Authorised’

. For exception reporting:
. For exception states E20 — E26, , E32, E33 report the DIFFERENCE in the two values
. Incomplete states 16 — 19 will report the value of the ‘C4’ if a difference exists between

the value of the “S’ and the ‘C4’

. For exception state E39, always report against the reconciliation date.

Reconciliation Date / Column Date = Run Date — N where N = 5. There is no
maximum number of days within report NB101b. NB101b reports as many
Reconciliation Dates / Column Dates as necessary subject to the rules identified within
section 3.1.4.1

For example, if on 06/01/2001 subject to the rules identified within section 3.1.3.1 for
NB101a, either an exception remains or a new transaction is received for reconciliation
date 01/01/2001 or earlier, the appropriate reconciliation date would be included
within NB101b until no exceptions remained. In effect NB101b could run for an
indefinite number of Reconciliation Dates / Column Dates if exceptions remained or
late transaction components were received.

NB102: Exception Summary

This report is divided into twelve sections:

Section 1: Uncleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & TIP exceptions <24 hours
Section 2: Uncleared Exceptioned Client Transactions

Section 3: Uncleared NBE / DRS corruption’s

Section 4: Uncleared Timing Differences

Section 5: Uncleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & TIP exceptions >24 hours
Section 6: Uncleared Future Dated Transactions by Client

Section 7: Cleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & TIP exceptions <24 hours
Section 8: Cleared Exceptioned Client Transactions

Section 9: Cleared NBE / DRS corruption’s

Section 10: Cleared Timing Differences

Section 11: Cleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & TIP exceptions >24 hours
Section 12: Cleared Future Dated Transactions by Client

Liability issues are not covered within this document, nor are the business
processes involved in the resolution of any exception.

NB102: Rules

NB102 is run daily

2. NB102 is repeated for each Routing Gateway.

3. For each report section, the column ‘Values’ will be partitioned into 8 sub columns
to contain the values for: ‘C12’, ‘S’, ‘C4’, ‘C112’ & the four values from a ‘D’
which are: Amount Requested, Amount Authorised, Amount Confirmed, Amount
Discrepancy. The reports will populate all values that are available.

4. For reporting purposes within NB102 sections 2,3,4,5,8,9,10,11, the column

headed ‘Discrepancy Type’ will report the ‘D’ discrepancy type and be populated

with the following codes:

© 01 - [E2] not received by maximum number of retries or at close of next
business day - Business Rule BR — 054

e (02 - Mismatch of value between [R2] and [C2] BR - 021

© 03 - [C2] approve for [A1] Decline BR -033

© 04 - [C2] approve with no R or A messages i.e. orphan [C2] - BR - 026

NB: “BR-nnn” refers to a business rule in the NBE Business Rules Catalogue,
reference [12].

5. Where an exception is set to F99 by ICL Pathway, clearance of this exception
within the appropriate NB102 section, (e.g. section 2 exceptions shown as cleared
within section 8), will always refer to the previously reported state regardless of
any change of state which may have occurred within the DRS.

Within this report, for clarity within the row titles, the following definitions will be

used:

¢ Confirmed Client Transactions (CCT) are defined as ‘Confirmed Txns”

e Authorised Client Transactions Awaiting Confirmation (ACTAC) are defined
as ‘Unconfirmed Txns’

e Exceptioned Client Transactions (ECT) are defined as ‘Exceptioned Txns’

Uncleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & TIP exceptions <24 hours are reported as

summary totals by exception type - (NB102 section 1)

Uncleared Exceptioned Client Transactions are listed individually - (NB102

section 2)

Uncleared NBE/ DRS corruption’s exceptions are listed individually - (NB102

section 3)

Uncleared Timing Differences are listed individually — (NB102 section 4)

Uncleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & TIP exceptions >24 hours are listed

individually — (NB102 section 5)

. Uncleared Future Dated Transactions are reported as summary totals by Client

identified by Routing_Gateway — (Section 6)

. Cleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & TIP exceptions <24 hours are reported as

summary totals by exception type - (NBE102 section 7)

Cleared Exceptioned Client Transactions are listed individually — (NB102 section
8)

Cleared NBE / DRS corruption’s are listed individually — (NB102 section 9)
Cleared Timing differences are listed individually — (NB102 section 10)

Cleared Confirmed, Unconfirmed & TIP exceptions >24 hours are listed
individually — (NB102 section 11)

Cleared Future Dated Transactions are reported as summary totals by Client
identified by Routing_Gateway — (Section 12)

. Where both volume and value are zero within sections 3 and 9, the appropriate line

is suppressed

Within each section, exception summary totals / individual transactions are to be
grouped and sub totalled by reconciliation date with a total provided for the entire
section.

. For reporting purposes:

¢ Timing Differences: relate to differences in the reconciliation date / settlement
date allocated where a settlement date on a transaction element is not the same
as the reconciliation date first reported on that transaction.

¢ Future Dated Transactions: relate to those transactions that have a
Reconciliation Date ahead of the Run Date of the report. For example, most
Clients will settle Friday, Saturday and Sunday transactions on the following
Monday. This means that each transaction completed on these days will have a
Reconciliation Date ahead of the Run Date of the report. These transactions
are expected to clear naturally once the Reconciliation Date and the Run Date
are in sync, however in the rare eventuality that a Reconciliation Date is
considerably ahead of the Run Date, POL may wish to clear the exception
manually. In this case, ICL Pathway will set the transaction to ‘F99’.

NB103: Settled transaction / Cash Account Reconciliation Statement

This report allows POL to reconcile the settlement stream against the Outlet Cash
Account stream. This reconciliation is required as settlement with the individual POL
clients is based upon the reconciliation date, i.e. the business day upon which the
transaction took place — this is carried right through the ‘C4’, ‘S’ & ‘D’, transaction
components. To complete a full reconciliation, it is important to know which Cash
Account the settled transaction was posted to, to enable a reconciliation of settlement
to be made with the outlet records. This report reconciles the transactions by
reconciliation date and Cash Account record.

NB103: Rules

1. NB103 is run weekly: In order to align with internal POL / TIP processing it is
required that this report is produced AFTER TPS processing on Friday and
BEFORE TPS processing on Saturday. The report should include all C4, S and D
transaction components where:
¢ reconciliation date = run date and,

e reconciliation date = run date — ‘N’ (where ‘N’ = I to 13).

2. Where a C112 is available and the CAP is known, the transaction will be posted
against the appropriate CBDB applicable to the reconciliation date — (see rules 8 &
9).

3. Where no C112 is available and therefore the CAP is unknown:

e the C4, S and D transaction components should be posted to “No Cash
Account Allocated’ (Column 7

e then, when the C112 becomes available, the entry should be deleted from ‘No _
Cash Account Allocated’ (Column 7) and posted to the appropriate CBDB
week applicable to the reconciliation date on the C112 (see rules 8 & 9)

e  ifno C112 has been received after 14 days, the entry within ‘No Cash
Account Allocated’ (Column 7) should remain until the C112 becomes
available even if this exceeds 14 days

4. If a transaction is posted to the row ‘No C/A to TIP’ (according to it’s
reconciliation date):
¢ the transaction should remain in this row until the Cash Account has been

delivered to TIP and then move up into the row ‘C/A to TIP’

e  ifno Cash Account has been delivered to TIP after 14 days, the entry within
‘No C/A to TIP’ should remain until the Cash Account is delivered to TIP
even if this exceeds 14 days

5. As the report is run each week, the transactions should move across the report
according to the CAP and the reconciliation date; for example, a transaction posted
to CBDB>=plus 2 in the first week, will move to CBDB plus 1 the second week
and then appear in CBDB the third week, until disappearing off the report after 14
days

6. NBI03 reports on VALUE only

7. Only system states for settled transaction types (C4, S & D) to appear on this
report

8. Five CAP’s will be shown, the ‘CBDB’, the ‘CBDB’ minus 1, the ‘CBDB’ <=
minus 2, the ‘CBDB’ plus I and the ‘CBDB’ >=plus 2. In addition, those settled
transactions which currently have not been allocated a Cash Account will be
shown.

9. The ‘CBDB’ Cash Account period (CAP) equates to TWO CAP’s prior to the
CAP applicable to the run date of the report. For example: If the report was run on
Saturday 20" January within CAP42 (CAP 42 commenced on Thursday 17"
January), the ‘CBDB’ CAP would be CAP40 (CAP40 commenced Thursday 3"
January, ended Wednesday 9" January)

10. Where the CAP in which the Outlet is trading is numerically more than 2 weeks
prior to the ‘CBDB’ CAP, if this takes the Outlet CAP into the previous year, this
will be reported as such. For example: The ‘CBDB’ CAP is CAP I and the Outlet
is trading in CAP 51, this is assumed to be CAP 51 of the previous year,
(therefore ‘CBDB’ <=minus 2) and not reported ahead in the current year.

. For exception reporting:
¢ For states: 16 — 19_use the ‘C4’ value
For states: 12 — 15, 20 - 23 use value on ‘D’ ‘Amount Confirmed’
