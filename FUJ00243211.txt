Dear Owen,
Thank you for your letter dated 23 July.

It is unfortunate that Nick was not able to attend the meeting as discussed. The original purpose of
writing to Nick was to escalate, CEO to CEO the concerns relating to certain behaviours within the
Post Office. It seems clear that the Post Office continues to have significant cultural issues, sees
itself as a “victim” with the enforcement and prosecution of postmasters considered as a business as
usual activity of a commercial retail company. As I stated in my correspondence to Nick and during
our discussion, Fujitsu finds the language and the suggested behaviour unacceptable from Post
Office investigators.

I do not intend to engage further with the Post Office on the matters I raised. We completely trust in
Sir Wyn and the Inquiry process which will examine the extent of the Post Office change in Phase 7.

You will recall that I have stated publicly Fujitsu does not wish to extend the contract with the Post
Office and your letter has reinforced the challenges we have as an organisation with continuing to do
business with the Post Office. As agreed some months ago with Nick, we wish to continue to prioritize
the necessary work on exit and the Post Office has hired an external person who starts in August to
take responsibility for this. While there have been several workshops to scope out the 5 year request,
your statement when we met regarding a 2 year request needs rapid attention from the Post Office.
Dan Walton has arranged an initial meeting with Neil on 25th July, to address his technical questions
and there is a workshop with other Post Office personal to update Dan on the 2 year requirements.

Yours sincerely,

PAUL PATTERSON I
