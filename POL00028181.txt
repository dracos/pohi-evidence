101.2 Precedence of the Related Agreements

POCL Agreement, the provisions of the AUTHORITIES’
Agreement shall prevail.

the POCL Agreement

The provisions of the POCL Agreement may not be
amended unless such amendment is approved on behalf
of the parties at the appropriate levels of authority
as follows:

(a) except as provided by paragraph (b) below, and
subject to the change control procedures
specified in Schedule A5 of the AUTHORITIES’
Agreement, amendments to the Clauses, Schedules
and Annexes of the POCL Agreement must be
approved by the POCL Development Director or his

Director or his successor on behalf of the
CONTRACTOR;

(b) any amendment to the Clauses, Schedules or

in Schedule B4 of the AUTHORITIES’ Agreement or
of the Double Key Solutions in Schedule B5 of
the AUTHORITIES’ Agreement in whole or in part
shall be subject to the approval of all three
parties thereto in accordance with Clause

specified in Schedule A5 of the POCL Agreement.

proves that such failure or delay has been

POCL VERSION 5.0 15 May 1996

POL00028181
POL00028181

RESTRICTED - CONTRACTS

directly caused by the failure of DSS or POCL to
perform any of its obligations under the Related
Agreements. This Clause shall not apply to
Clause 809, which shall be governed by the
specific rule stated in Clause 809.2.

Clause 102. Interpretations

102.1 As used in the POCL Agreement:

102.1.1 the terms and expressions set out in
Schedule Al shall have the meanings ascribed
therein;

102.1.2 the masculine includes the feminine
and the neuter; and

102.1.3 the singular includes the plural and
vice versa.

102.2 A reference to any statute, enactment, order,
regulation or other similar instrument shall be
construed as a reference to the statute, enactment,
order, regulation or instrument as amended by any
subsequent statute, enactment, order, regulation or
instrument or as contained in any subsequent re-
enactment thereof.

102.3 Headings are included in the POCL Agreement for
ease of reference only and shall not affect the
interpretation or construction of the POCL Agreement.

102.4 References in the POCL Agreement to Clauses,
Parts and Schedules are, unless otherwise provided,
references to the clauses, parts, and schedules of
the POCL Agreement.

102.5 In the event and to the extent only of any
conflict or inconsistency between the Clauses and
Schedule Al and the Schedules (other than Schedule
Al), the Clauses and Schedule Al shall prevail. In
the event and to the extent only of any conflict or
inconsistency between the Schedules (other than
Schedule Al), the provisions of Schedules 2, A2 to
All, A1l3 and Al4 shall prevail over those of all
other Schedules (other than Schedule Al), the
provisions of Schedule A15 shall prevail over those
of all other such Schedules, and the provisions of
Schedule A16 shall prevail over those of the other
Schedules, except those of the Schedules listed
above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if and only to
the extent that Schedule 3 expressly states that a
particular requirement in Schedule A15 will be met in
a particular form, manner or quantity, or at a
particular time or place, the provisions of Schedule
3 will prevail. Moreover, for the avoidance of

POCL VERSION 5.0 15 May 1996

RESTRICTED - CONTRACTS

POL00028181
POL00028181

doubt, POCL acknowledges that a particular solution
in Schedule Al6 shall not be treated as being in
conflict or inconsistent with any requirement in
Schedule A15 merely because the solution states that
the requirement will be met in a particular form,
manner, quantity, time or place.

102.6 The Recitals are not legally binding, but are
intended as a guide to the interpretation and
construction of the POCL Agreement.

Clause 103. Severability

If any provision of the POCL Agreement is held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable for any reason by any court or
regulatory body of competent jurisdiction, such provision
shall be severed and the remainder of the provisions
hereof shall continue in full force and effect as if the
POCL Agreement had been executed with the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision eliminated. In the
event of a holding so fundamental as to prevent the
accomplishment of the purpose of the POCL Agreement, POCL
and the CONTRACTOR shall immediately commence good faith
negotiations to remedy such invalidity. However, if POCL
and the CONTRACTOR fail to conclude such negotiations
within a reasonable period of time, the POCL Agreement
shall terminate without further liability to any party
(subject to Clause 902.7). For purposes of the
foregoing, the parties acknowledge that a holding of
invalidity of any part of Clauses 106.7, 106.8 or 106.9
shall be treated as so fundamental as to prevent the
accomplishment of the purpose of the POCL Agreement.

Clause 104. Law and Jurisdiction

104.1 The POCL Agreement shall be considered as a
contract made in England and according to English Law
and, subject to Clause 807, shall be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts to which
the parties hereby submit.

Agreement is binding on POCL and its successors and
permitted assignees and on the CONTRACTOR and the
CONTRACTOR's successors and permitted assignees.

Clause 105. Entire Agreement

This POCL Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
AUTHORITIES’ Agreement constitute the entire
understanding between the parties relating to the subject
matter of the POCL Agreement and, save as may be
expressly referred to or referenced herein, supersede all

prior representations, agreements, negotiations or
understandings with respect thereto, whether oral or in
writing, except in respect of any fraudulent
misrepresentation made by either party.

CONTRACTOR shall have no control over the use or
marketing of the POCL Services, including in relation

unnecessary as a result of any Default by the

liability shall be subject to the other limitations
and provisions set out herein.

810.6 For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged

made or action brought to which Clause
904.2.5(b) applies, the CONTRACTOR shall be
