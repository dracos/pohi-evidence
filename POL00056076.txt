Audit of Post Office@Birkenshaw, Branch Code 163 306

On the 08 Feb 2011 I conducted an audit of the above named branch, the purpose of
this audit was to perform a check of the cash. I arrived at the branch at 08.30 am and
awaited the arrival of the Postmaster who arrived at approximately 08.45 am. I
introduced myself to the Postmaster Mr Khayyam Ishaq and advised him that I was to
Perform an audit of his cash on behalf of Post Office Ltd,

Mr Khayyam Ishaq allowed me access to the secure area, and was. present in the
secure area whilst the audit was carried out. I contacted the Network Business
Support Centre (NBSC) at approximately 08.55 am and advised that an audit would be
performed at the branch, and that it would remain closed until its conclusion. The
nominated branches offered were: Drighlington & Tong Street and a notice placed on
display at the branch detailing this information. The audit revealed a shortage of £536
and ! asked Mr Khayyam Ishaq if that was what he expected he said it was different
from when he had declared the cash the previous day but he was prepared to accept
it. At this point at 09.401 phoned yourself and made you aware that not only was
there a shortage on the day of £536 but also the balance snapshot was carrying a net
discrepancy of £2100+. I was then instructed to carry out a Tier 2 audit, I explained to
Mr Khayyam Ishaq what I had been instructed to do and proceeded to perform a full
audit of all the cash and stock. At 11.40 am Kath Smith Field Support Advisor arrived
at the office to assist me with the audit
