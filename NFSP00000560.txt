REPORT OF A MEETING OF THE NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE
held on 2nd/3rd JUNE 1997
at the GRAFTON HOTEL, LONDON

Present Mr AM Burrows — Chairman

Mr A R Butlin
Mrs J Kendall
Mr J Peberdy

In Attendance Mr C Baker General Secretary
Mr K Davis Asst General Secretary

THE CHAIRMAN welcomed members of the Negotiating Committee to the
meeting. He congratulated every member on being re-elected.

In view of the fact that Mr. J. Evans of Post Office Counters would be
attending during the course of the meeting to discuss networking, it was
decided to debate the following matters first. Government Affairs (PO PZ);
Network Issues - Counter Automation (PC NW 06 01); Distribution (PO PC
03), Isle of Man (OI IM); National Lottery (CL LO 01).

A) REPORTS OF MEETINGS

The minutes of the meetings held on 3/4th March 1997 and 29th April 1997
had been circulated and were approved.

GOVERNMENT REVIEW - PO PZ

The GENERAL SECRETARY reported receipt of a fax from lan McCartney
MP, Minister of State at the Department of Trade & Industry, who was
scoping the problems, reviewing and taking stock of The Post Office. It was
understood the Minister wished to understand the problem by the summer
recess of Parliament, then put a paper to his colleagues and, if, Cabinet
approval given, the detail would be considered. By using Utility Régulations,
it may be possible to appoint a Regulator for The Post Office which might be
a way of gaining commercial freedom. The GENERAL SECRETARY had
been given to understand the Government wished The Post Office to remain
wholly in the public sector as one entity. The Government was very keen on
employee conditions and minimum wages.

With regard to the meeting with lan McCartney, the GENERAL SECRETARY
advised a small group had been requested.

COUNTER AUTOMATION - PC NW 06 01

The GENERAL SECRETARY reported he had visited Newcastle on 27th and
28th May in the company of Paul Rich and John Bennett in which area OBCS
was being installed in 100 Sub Post Offices. The reaction from Sub-
Postmasters was of delight.

The action points from the meeting were circulated (copy attached). Two
Sub-Postmasters had had to have new procedures which indicated a problem
on the hardware and the Post Office was checking to see whether they had
been properly tested. Although the engineer responded within 4 hours to the
call out, it took half a day to re-programme the equipment. To assist with
creating space on the counter one idea was to install a parcel hopper which
closed on the back of the front of the counter for security reasons.

With regard to signing off of work, it would probably be the responsibility of
the Sub-Postmaster and the Retail Network Manager. Sub-Postmasters had
felt they were not receiving sufficient communication. A central file would be
held as to the location of the equipment in each office.

Each time equipment failed Sub-Postmasters would be asked to report the
problem. The Committee suggested that an error log would save the Sub-
Postmaster having to stop and report a system failure when busy. THE
GENERAL SECRETARY to refer the suggestion to Post Office Counters.

The Post Office was consulting with Peritas with regard to use of Post Office
premises for training as some buildings were not suitable for disabled access.
Pathway staff had been praised for their assistance.

The security policy was to be reviewed by Paul Rich and Jonathan Evans. It
was understood there was a difficulty with the removal of the speech units in
the screen.

The Post Office had come to the conclusion that “business as usual” during
installation was impracticable and impossible.

MR. BURROWS thanked the General Secretary for visiting Newcastle,
particularly as it was his first day after the holiday.

MRS. KENDALL circulated a letter being sent to Sub-Postmasters in the
Leeds area inviting them to apply for the post of Horizon Field Support
Officer. THE GENERAL SECRETARY advised he had requested the Post
Office to desist from advertising for the time being, although the principle of
Sub-Postmasters assisting was good and an opportunity for the Federation.

MR. PEBERDY had been approached by his Region with regard to the idea
of Sub-Postmasters as Field Support Officers. The vacancy had been
advertised internally in the Post Office, 100 applicants, 40 interviewed. In his

NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE - 2/3 JUNE 1997 5

I

Region the idea was to offer Branch Secretaries a short term contract for six
months, paid at the PA rate of approximately £10,000 per annum. He had
drawn attention to the problem of selective advertising, breach of contract,
conflict of self-employed, double employed.

MRS. KENDALL pointed out that £10,000 per annum was insufficient for a
Branch Secretary to employ a relief.

MR. BURROWS expressed grave concern at the Regional activity for support
staff. In his view the recruitment of support staff should be centrally
controlled.

THE GENERAL SECRETARY advised he had discussed the matter with
Mr Coleman.

MRS. KENDALL suggested recently retired Sub-Postmasters would be ideal
candidates for support staff.

MR. BURROWS was perturbed that information was not being communicated
and co-ordinated centrally.

THE GENERAL SECRETARY explained the PDA was a separate body from
Post Office Counters, the Retail Development Centre was deating with money
and Sub-Postmasters’ affairs, Paul Rich was Director of Automation and
Jonathan Evans was Network Director. In his view there was a need for co-
ordination both within the Federation and Post Office Counters.

MR. BURROWS endquired as to the position with regard to the non-cash
account and small rural offices being asked what they intended to do when
automation was installed and whether they were prepared to have the
equipment.

MR. BUTLIN reported the Executive Officers had managed to stop the Post
Office from approaching the non-cash account offices telling them they would
become cash account offices.

THE GENERAL SECRETARY commented the ACC stated on retirement non-
cash account offices would be converted but the Post Office was trying to
pressure the change now.

MR. BURFORD drew attention to an office which had no mains electricity
supply. THE GENERAL SECRETARY confirmed the Post Office was aware of
the office in question.

MR. BURROWS understood small offices would have lap top computers but
the Post Office did not appear to be offering that facility.

MR. BUTLIN drew attention to the Regional Security budgets not being able
to fund screen changes required as a result of the installation of counter
automation.

With regard to training for counter automation, MR. PEBERDY suggested
seeking a training payment for assistants.

MR. BUTLIN pointed out people attended quality training meetings and put
forward the idea that Customer Charter be stopped for a while and the budget
utilised for automation training.

THE GENERAL SECRETARY said that he believed a policy was required
from the Executive Council and noted MR. PEBERDY’s suggestion of
conceding payment for Sub-Postmasters but seek a payment for assistants.

In response to MR. BURFORD'’s question as to training for one-man offices,
MR. BURROWS stated the matter had been resolved but ideas were being
put forward with regard to training at weekends or evenings so as to fit with
the requirements of Sub-Postmasters.

MR. BURROWS stated a response was awaited from Post Office Counters.

8(b) COUNTER AUTOMATION - BA/POCL - PC NW 06 01

In response to MRS. KENDALL’s question regarding payment, the GENERAL
SECRETARY explained a meeting was being sought with Post Office
Counters.

MR. PEBERDY suggested there was an opportunity for the NFSP Trading
Co. for the production and sale of a box to hold the foils.

MR. BUTLIN drew attention to the need for information in respect of the
number of pensions.

Van

It was suggested a Branch Secretaries’ Circular be used to request the
information sought.

MRS. KENDALL put forward the idea of waiting until a year after automation
had commenced before agreeing a new payment. The figures produced by a
member indicated on average 25% income would be lost to Sub-Postmasters.
THE GENERAL SECRETARY pointed out that Sub-Postmasters were
anxious as to their rate of pay and did not want to see any delay.

MR. BURROWS suggested trialling 120 offices.
THE GENERAL SECRETARY suggested awaiting the next meeting with the
Post Office.

Convenience Store,

Our company is an agent for
Norweb and British Gas. In the
case of Norweb we receive com-
mission of one per cent.

We consider this to be less than
ideal for the work involved, the
fairly large sums of cash to
account for and on which banking
charges are levied.

Imagine our horror when we
were informed by Norweb that
they are going to contract out their
scheme to PayPoint, which
informs us that the derisory sum
of 0.5 per cent will in future be the
commission rate - 50p for every
£100 collected! A large percent-
age of 50p will be taken up by our
cash transmission banking fee.

PayPoint is taking a non nego-
tiable stance in the belief that we
should be satisfied with any

it is outrageous that we are
