Dear Sirs

BATES & OTHERS v POST OFFICE LIMITED — GROUP ACTION
CLAIM NO: HQ16X01238 and HQ17X02637
KNOWN ERROR LOG (KEL)

We write further to your letter dated 22 September 2017 and note that Fujitsu has agreed that the
Claimants’ IT expert may inspect the KEL at its premises in Bracknell.

Our clients agree to this proposal in principle. However, please first provide a contact name for the
relevant individual at Fujitsu who is to facilitate access. Our IT expert considers that a preliminary
call with this individual will be necessary to understand the nature of the database and to
determine the most appropriate means of inspecting it.

Please provide your response by no later than 12pm on 29 September 2017, so that our expert

can make contact early next week, following which we will write to you with further proposals,
including available dates, for inspection.

Yours faithfully
