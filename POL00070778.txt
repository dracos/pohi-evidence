Dear Mandy,

lan Herbert of Hugh James has asked to see a copy of the letter that I sent to Nick Samuel to forward to Fujitsu
(copy attached for ease of ref). I think HJ want to ensure we are all consistent in what we want Fujitsu to do.

I'm happy to send this to HJ, but just wanted to double check with you first that it was ok.

Kind regards,

Stephen Dilley
Solicitor
