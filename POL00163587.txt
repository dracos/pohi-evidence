Attachment: Shouldham Post Office Audit Suspension Breifing (002).docx
Hi Al

With thanks to Ken, please find attached a note on Shouldham Post Office in Liz Truss’s
constituency.

In summary:

e the closure was due to our suspending the Postmaster after an audit.

e the Postmaster reported having regular balancing shortages after new horizon kit was
installed last July

e the PO was operated from the Postmasters house, so difficult to put in a temp
operator

e Weare looking at the cost of a Mobile PO to cover the village

e The contracts team are trying to fix a meeting with the Postmaster (who says she is
now represented by the CWU)

e Ken has updated Liz Truss’s office on the phone today, and is drafting a note for her.

Please do shout if you have any questions.
Best wishes

Jane

Good morning Elizabeth, Help! Our post office is closing.( Shouldham) .

The reason is disturbing. Apparently there are problems with the operting system of the post office
computers resulting in accounting anomalys.The amounts in our case bear no relation to the amounts that
the postmistress handles. I am as sure as one can be that the lady is honest and having run the post office
for 29 years has not suddenly started making mistakes.

Unfortunately the situation cannot be endured so the post office is closing.

In fairness I have spoken to representatives of the post office who are trying to get an interim person to
run the office.

What is concerning however, is that this may not be confined to this one office. One ex- postmaster has
told me that “ there are hundreds of ex post office keepers who have been under suspicion or worse
because of this problem.”

I have no proof of anything and was only told about this yesterday.

This subject, and the possible implications of it are too much for me to handle.

Kind regards, Geoff Hipperson.
