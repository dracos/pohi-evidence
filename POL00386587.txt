Thanks Mark

We are already well covered on (1) - it's in the exisiting brief (remote access IS possible but we have strong line on
conditions for that)

On (2) re audits and tests etc of system - there was an FO! in 2011 on this that Sparrow have been checking for ys
because we must have provided info to SS at some point I would think. It was a strong FO! answer.

Dear both, your help please in answers and in phrasing those answers, in prep for the SC:

1) "is it possible to access the system remotely? We are told it is."

What is the true answer? I hope it is that we know this is not possible and that we are able to
explain why that is. I need to say no it is not possible and that we are sure of this because of xxx
and that we know this because we have had the system assured.

2) "you have said this is such a vital system to the Post Office, what testing do you do and how
often? When was the last time?

Lesley, I need the facts on these - I know we have discussed before but I haven't got the answer
front of mind - too many facts to hold in my head! But this is an important one and I want to be
sure I do have it. And then Mark, to phrase the facts into answers, plus a line to take the

conversation back up a level - ie., to one of our narrative boxes/rocks.

Thanks, Paula
