Andy

This is the statement template which you need to use. Fill it in with the details from the calls and amend the details
highlighted in yellow.

Please return to me tomorrow, when completed as I would like to see it before we send it off to Graham.
Many thanks for your help with this, and I will amend/note this on your appraisal going forward.

Any help always ask me or Peter but meanwhile I will have a chat with Mik Peach on this too.

Once again thanks

Brian
