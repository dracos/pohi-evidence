Thanks Andy and understood.

I’ll advise Tom to try to deflect requests for the document for the time being. For all additional Qs I will
suggest he ‘takes them away’ so that we can think about how to manage them (but because both parties
know a lot about this case there shouldn’t be any major issues).

Presumably you will let us know once defence is filed, in person, at the Court.

Mel

See attached comments from me. It's unclear whether these meetings would be covered by legal privilege so I would
prefer not to say certain things — particularly around Post Office's future expectations or intentions.

We can provide them with the Defence but I would like to hold this back for a few weeks. If the Claimant do leak the
defence we can definitively say it came from them (which will be more difficult if we've allowed the Defence to be
distributed).

Thanks
A

Subject: Urgent - speaking notes for Tom - in strictest confidence

Hello both

Sorry to add to heavy workloads but could you please look over these two short documents — draft speaking
notes for Tom M, who will call both NFSP and BEIS tomorrow. So he needs them cob.

Both are largely taken from the GE paper, but obviously a bit tailored for audience and anticipating a few
likely Qs. Both NFSP and BEIS are v familiar with the issues of course but please advise if any of the detail
here should be excluded/ amended.

Presumably if either party asks for a copy of the Defence Document we should be prepared to provide it,
since it is a public document, even if not ideal to do so in that they should remain arms length. 2a

Many thanks

Mel Corfield
