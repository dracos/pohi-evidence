Investigation Team Post Office Limited

c.c. Adrian Morris

POST OFFICE LIMITED v
CASE NO: POLTD/0708/0249

Read and noted thank you. In my opinion the evidence is sufficient to afford a
realistic prospect of conviction of the above named on the charges set out on the
attached schedule. You will note that I have charged the above named with the
theft of £74,609.84 in view of the fact that these losses were accrued for a period
over a year age. I have also charged false accounting for the Branch Trading
Statements for the period I have with my papers. All relevant accounts and
documentation should be produced in full. If Ms Misra pleads Guilty to the false
accounting then it is recommended that the prosecution in respect of the theft is not
proceeded with.

This case is, in my opinion, more suitable for trial in the Crown Court. When the
decision has been taken please proceed to obtain summons.

The matters which follow are for Mr Adrian Morris to deal with.
If the Defendant should elect trial or if the Magistrates refuse jurisdiction or if a Not
Guilty plea is entered, the Investigation Manager should obtain and associate all
necessary statements and exhibits. I list below the statements which appear to be
necessary in this case, but the Investigation Manager should also consider whether
there are any other areas which can usefully be covered and include any such
evidence.

1 A statement giving evidence of access explaining the Subpostmistress’s duties
and period of service.

2 Copy statement producing the relevant extract from the accounts and the full
audit and statement from the Auditors.

3 A statement explaining the Horizon system, accounting procedure and the
Branch Trading period, relevant accounts and documents should be produced.

4 Copy statement from the Auditors dealing with the findings of the audit.

5 Copy statement from Interviewing Officer and Officer present during interview.
