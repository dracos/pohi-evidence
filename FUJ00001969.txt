Version: 3.0
Company-in-Confidence Date: 17/10/05

1.0 Introduction

The On Line Services reporting produced by Fujitsu via the Data Reconciliation Service
(DRS) has been designed to enable On Line Services; Alliance & Leicester, LINK, Card
Account for Post Office (CAPO), Debit & Credit Card (D&CC) and Electronic Top Up
(ETU) transactions completed in the Post Office branches to allow settlement to be made with
Post Office Clients, e.g. LINK, or direct settlement to specific Clients or financial institutions.

1.1. Supplementary Documentation

This document supplements two (2) other On Line Services Reconciliation Service Contract
Controlled Documents (CCD) as defined in Schedule 1 to this Agreement, by providing
information on the Reconciliation Service and reconciliation and settlement reporting. In
order to do this, references are made in this document to such other On Line Services
Reconciliation Service CCDs.

1.2 Document Structure

As a consequence of the interconnecting nature of the On Line Services Reconciliation CCDs
as explained in paragraph 1.1 above, the numbering in this document has assumed a particular
numbering structure. If then, as a result of Soft Change Control Procedure or otherwise, the
contents of this document are altered there may need to be consequential changes to the other
On Line Services Reconciliation Service CCDs. In order to prevent the need for such
consequential changes it is advised that in the event of changes being made to this document
the numbering is as far as possible preserved

1.3 Statement of Precedence

In the event of any conflict or ambiguity the provisions of this CCD shall take precedence over
the provisions of the following CCD’s:

© On Line Services Reconciliation & Incident Management NB/PRO/002
e On Line Services End to End Reconciliation Reporting CS/SPE/011

2.0 Scope

The reconciliation and settlement reporting services for On Line Services transactions (the
“Data Reconciliation Service”) are described in this paragraph 3.0.

Line Services reconciliation system required by which shall be developed and

operated by as part of the On line Services. Such part is referred to in this as the
“Reconciliation System”.

3.1.2 and shall follow the reconciliation and incident management procedures (applicable
to each of them) for the investigation, reporting and resolution of business
incidents related to the On Line Services as set out in the CCD entitled “On Line
Services Reconciliation and Incident Management” (NB/PRO/002).

3.1.3 shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its agreement to the design of back end
processes and On Line Services transaction processing procedures required to
support the reconciliation and incident management of On Line Services
transactions.

3.1.4 Reconciliation between counter and Branch Trading Statement

Reconciliation of Electronic Point Of Sale System (EPOSS) transactions to the Branch
Trading Statement shall be dealt with at summary level using the reconciliation functionality
used for EPOSS as a Service that existed prior to the introduction of On Line Services.
Such reconciliation functionality shall ensure that all On Line Services _ transactions
(reflected in C1 Confirmations) are included in the Branch Trading Statement, but shall not
identify erroneous Branch Trading Statement mappings which cause such On Line Services
transactions to be included in the wrong section of the Branch Trading Statement, or non-
On Line Services transactions to be included in Branch Trading Statement section intended
for On Line Services transactions. Reconciliation to the Branch Trading Statement
described in this paragraph 3.1.4 will be performed after the electronic Branch Trading
Statement is produced, which will be an indeterminate time after the Transactions have
been settled (in the same manner as for Services that existed prior to the introduction of On
Line Services) .

3.1.5 Branching data-flows

(a) The Reconciliation System shall enable reconciliation of Financial Transactions
arriving at the Data Reconciliation Service Host (DRSH) from the following three sources:

(i) the Confirmation Agent (i.e. the Cl Confirmations received by the
Confirmation Agent from the Counter Position);

(ii) the Alliance and Leicester, LINK, CAPO, D&CC and ETU Interfaces
(ie. D Messages and C4 Confirmations), and

(iii) the Transaction Processing Service (TPS) Host (ie. the Cl
Confirmations harvested by the TPS Agent )

which reconciliation shall be reported by in accordance with the CCD entitled “On
Line Services End to End Reconciliation Reporting” (CS/SPE/011).

In the event that a CO Confirmation is sent to Alliance and Leicester, LINK
,CAPO, D&CC and ETU the relevant Cl Confirmation will indicate that a CO
Confirmation has been generated.

(b) The Reconciliation System shall monitor the Financial Transactions and report On Line
Services transaction states which are:

3.1.6

(i) intrinsically anomalous, in that their occurrence implies malfunction in
End to End On Line Services; or

(ii) anomalous in that an expected state has persisted for an unexpected
duration (e.g. where Cl Confirmations are received from the Confirmation
Agent and C4 Confirmations are received from Alliance and Leicester, LINK
CAPO, D&CC and ETU but the Confirmation from the TPS Host has not been
received after an abnormal delay),

identifying any such anomalous On Line Services transaction states which require
human analysis for resolution.

(c) The expected On Line Services transaction states and On Line Services
transaction states which constitute exceptions are those set out in the CCD entitled
“On Line Services End to End Reconciliation Reporting” (CS/SPE/011).

(d) The DRS shall not produce reports which relate On Line Services transactions
included in Branch Trading Statements to On Line Services transactions included
in the Transaction files sent by the TPS Host to Post Office Ltd Financial Systems
(POLFS) and Post Office Ltd Management Information Systems (POLMIS), as
these shall be covered by the reconciliation reporting and processes used for
EPOSS (as a Service that existed prior to the introduction of On Line Services )
and for POLFS.

Complete processing

(a) The Reconciliation System shall:

(i) ensure that all data received by it are processed;

(ii) check for completeness of Financial Transactions; and
