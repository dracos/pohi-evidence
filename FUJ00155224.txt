the problem is that transaction <GroupId:226242><Id: 1><Num:1425636> has corrupt primary mappings which do not align and this
causes DataServer to fail.

It notice that relevant product 21126 has correct mappings but was start dated after the failing transaction was written.
Perhaps there was a corrupt EPOSSProducts in existence at the time of the transaction?

It is a complete mystery as to how this erroneous value of the <[d4:> attribute within the Primary Mapping (<PM:>) attribute could
joe set for this one occurrance of this transaction. smart post merely copies the entire <PM:> attribute from the appropriate
roduct data to the transaction message. It has no interest in its contents. It does not manipulate individual attributes within
this attribute.

9:01 User:Richard O'Neill

there are no products within the entire message store, including out-of-date products, that have the erroneous value of <L4:>
that has appeared in this one transaction message. So, the hypothesis that somehow the wrong product has been used can be
Jdiscounted.

[this may be a RetailBroker or Escher Mails problem that has somehow corrupted the data.

can the rollover process be changed to simply flag the problem for manual fixing and then complete the rollover? This would then
lavoid the dire consequences, suggested in the PEAK, for a delay in making the rollover.

[Start of Responsel

ith regards to Richard's suggestion.

fhe problem was in fact already flagged. A message in the audit log pin pointed the precise message that caused the problem.

the error handling of balancing is deficient in some ways. In most cases an error is just logged and the code bluders on
regardless leaving the system locked. What should happen is that the error should be logged, the process cleanly aborted, an
lerror message displayed to the user and the system left so that he can do something else. I hope the HNGx version is much better.
Ir am not sure it is worth while spending time improving the EPOSS version which is shortly to be replaced; it would be better
spending the same effort making the HNGx version better. I had already requested that this be advised to the HNGx team in
lpco152376.

JAt the moment, under the original PC0152828, attempts are being made to import a corrected message
kGroupid: 226242><Id:1><Num:1425636> to allow the balancing to proceed.

it is too early to say whether this process will succeed.
i have already got the stock unit roll by running a patched DataServer which corrects the corrupted transaction.
Ik propose a cheap general solution to the problem.

lA new version of DataServer be written which configurably corrects any messages found to be corrupt. It will be controlled by a
Inew collection the CorruptCorrection collection.

lkach object will contain

Data:
I). .<MessNum:

see S1d 2 X>
+ .<Num:¥>

S
<Correctio1

complete Corrected Message>

As DataServer runs it will check each message read in to see whether it matches anything in the CorruptCorrection collection
(which of course will usually not exist) and if it does it will correct the message.

ence my proposed fix will only be required if the volume of corrupt messages produced gets too great for the SSC to easily cope.

If it is required I have thought of an improvement which would help in this case. The correction collection should change to

Data:

<Correct FromEPOSSProduct :Z>

here Z is either True or False.

tf False (or the attribute is omitted) behaviour is as described before.

Itt True the Correction attribute is not required and instead the transaction is automatically corrected from data in the correct

I add a few further thoughts on this.

Richard in his comment “Date:2008-01-15 14:49:01 User:Richard O'Neill" states “Can the rollover process be changed to simply flag
[the problem for manual fixing and then complete the rollover?”.

the rollover process already flagged the failing transaction to the audit log but left the system locked. I think the ideal
lbchaviour would be to flag the problem but leave the system in a useable state. In my opinion it would have been a mistake to
lallow the rollover process to continue because you would end up with a balance report with incorrect figures. The whole point of
accounting is to end up with correct figures!

lence I believe the existing behaviour of the error handling in this case is not so very different to the ideal behaviour and
hence not worth fixing because of its imminent replacement by HNG-X.

Ite we want to do anything to balancing it is what I propose - simplify supplying the corrected input.

If this problem crops up again we really want to raise a PEAK on the fact that corrupt transactions are being produced. This was
the original point of this clone but Richard has diverted it back to balancing again! Just because we do not know the reason for
the corrupt transaction being produced does not stop it being a bug! Maybe the problem needs analysing a little more and sending
ito Escher.
