Subject: PM NED matter

Hi Henry,
I hope you’ve arrived back safe and sound.

I understand you have been advised previously of the investigation into apparent shortfalls in
branches held by Elliot Jacobs. By way of reminder:

* EJ owns a business, Universal Office Equipment (UOE), which runs seven premises containing
post offices;

* Since early 2019, UOE has accumulated shortfalls in the operation of its post office business;
© Prior to EJ becoming a NED he repaid some of the shortfall but since becoming a NED he has
not engaged with the repayment process nor challenged the shortfalls;

* Each month the POL team responsible for recovering agreed shortfalls has sent EJ a
statement showing the outstanding amounts;

* Training has been offered but not taken up;

* The uncontested shortfall now sits around £213k;

* EJis in the process of seeking to take on a further two post office premises;

* ClU is investigating under Project Venus 1) whether EJ should have declared his shortfalls in
the process of becoming a NED; 2) the extent of the shortfalls; 3) whether EJ declared a conflict
during Board meetings where recoveries from postmasters was discussed;

* Branch Assurance are to visit all seven of EJ’s locations to settle a full cash and stock position
in mid-April 2023.

Nick Read, Ben Foat and I would like to see you, tomorrow if possible, to request that you consider
meeting with Elliot to discuss this matter, particularly ahead of the next Board meeting. In terms of
your meeting with Elliot, we suggest the following points are covered:

* Due to increasing shortfalls at UOE, an investigation into how these have accrued is being
conducted — it seems that the amount has now reached in the region of £200,000

* As EJ is the sole director of UOE it is felt he is conflicted at Board when the various elements
of Postmaster recoveries are being discussed

* Because of this, EJ should not participate in discussions or be present at future Board
meetings when this agenda item is discussed — absolutely no problem for the other Board
Agenda items

* The CoSec will make sure EJ doesn’t inadvertently receive any Board papers relating to this
* Wanted to raise this to avoid any further conflicts

* As with other shortfall matters, Branch Assurance visits will take place, scheduled for April, to
determine a stock and cash position

* After that, the team will then seek to discuss with EJ this position

* Once the investigation completed the Chair and EJ can discuss a way forward

* It would be a positive step for EJ to re-engage with the Postmaster Account Support team
(Michelle Stevens) now in advance of the Branch Assurance visits in April

* It would be really helpful to have EJ’s view as to why the shortfalls have spiked recently —
(either now if he has a view and freely offers it, or during the investigative meeting post-branch
visits)

* If Elliot asks about the post-Branch Visit investigative meeting, the CIU team will write to
Elliot in advance, explaining what they propose to discuss, what the purpose is, and to advise
that he can bring a friend to that meeting or a NFSP rep or even a legal rep if he would like. It is
not an under caution interview and we are not conducting a criminal investigation. We are
looking to understand why these shortfalls occurred and what can be done to rectify the
position in terms of understanding and perhaps provision of training to his staff etc.

I have attached the Interim Report and the account running balance.

I am checking with Philippa and Di as to a convenient time to meet, perhaps after RemCo if that
would suit, so we can talk you through the above.

Best,
Rachel
