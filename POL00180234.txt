In speaking with Mike this afternoon we wondered if it is worth making a distinction in the TOR between cases that
have been prosecuted and those that haven't.

For those cases that have already been through the legal system we don’t want to be seen as reopening the cases,
instead we want to position those as a review of the existing evidence to enable an understanding of the allegations
and facts in regards to horizon.

For those that haven't been prosecuted we can position as a full independent investigation.

The overall report should then be a general conclusion looking at a mixture evidence already in existence (from
previous cases) and new evidence gained from their own investigation to determine whether there are any systemic
Horizon problems.

We've put in a meeting to discuss on Monday, but wanted to get this point across as you said you'd be working on the
TOR today.
