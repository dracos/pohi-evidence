STRATEGIC PLAN AND FUNDING AGREEMENT POLB(10)03

The Board noted the funding deal agreed with the Government and
congratulated the Post Office executive team on a successful result;

Dave Smith outlined the key elements of the deal:

(i) the deal covered the period from 2012/13 to 2014/15;

(ii) the financial difference between this deal and the one
noted by the Royal Mail Holdings plc Board at 4
September could be explained by the period of the deal
and the slower pace of change;

(iii) all payments from the Government were subject to State
Aid clearance;

(iv) receipt of the funding was dependant upon achievement
of milestones that were regarded by the Post Office
team as straight forward to achieve;

(v) there was some question about the involvement of the
Government in setting bonus targetry for senior
managers. This was unclear to the Board and was to be
resolved;

(vi) the terminology of the payments had been constructed
with a State Aid case in mind and Dave Smith confirmed
that there would be no repayment of the funding to the
Government;

the Board noted that the State Aid process for the 2010/11 funding
would start shortly and that it was explicit that Post Office Ltd would

noted that if this further funding were not forthcoming then it would
not be held to the number (11,500) of Post Offices required by the
Government, and this should be made clear to Government;

the Board noted that the funding for 2011/12 had yet to receive
State Aid clearance but there was confidence that this would be
achieved. The Board further noted that if State Aid clearance were
not granted then there was a risk that Post Office Ltd would no
longer be a going concern;

the Board noted that both Royal Mail Group and Post Office were
seeking a long term contract for the provision of mail services by
Post Office.

FINANCE UPDATE POLB(10)04

The Board noted the finance report and expressed concern that
sales performance was still adrift of target. The Board discussed the
action taken to improve sales and noted that Post Office Ltd had
parted company with the Marketing Director. It also noted that an
intense training programme had improved sales effectiveness by
20% for the 1000 agents who had completed it;

the Board further noted that the executive team expected to achieve
its profit target but that this would be through tight cost control
compensating for lower sales.

BANK OF IRELAND UPDATE

Mike Moores briefed the Board on the Bank of Ireland relationship.
He advised the Board that the BOI were coming to the view that the
current joint venture did not provide the best way forward for selling
their products within post offices. He also advised that BOI were
keen to review the Gamma payments (made for selling Financial
Services);

the Board noted that BOI wished to maintain exclusivity in their
relationship with Post Office Ltd;

the Board agreed that metrics to check that the BOI products were
fit for purpose should be established and reported back to the
Board.

POL TENDER FOR SMoTS POLB(10)05

The Board noted Mike Moores’ paper on Simple Money
Transmission Services and that there was an opportunity arising
from the comprehensive spending review by Government to review
the bid already submitted. The Board further noted that the
Company was confident that its bid would provide a much higher
qualitative specification than that provided by PayPoint (the other
bidder), but that it was unlikely to beat the competitor on price;

the Board noted the strategic importance of this contract to the
Company and noted that it would have been able to offer a
reduction in price to the Government had their requirement been for
the service to be offered in the core network of 4,500 offices;

the Board agreed that the compliant bid should not be reviewed but
that the variant bid would be reviewed in line with the proposal. The
Board noted that this would reduce the Net Present Value of the bid
from £4.6m to £2.9m and that the unit pricing would be reduced
from 45p to 31.5p for the first two years from April 2012 and then to
24p;

the Board agreed that a strategy paper would be produced for a
future meeting to look at the options for managing the competitive
challenges from PayPoint.

FORWARD PLAN FOR THE BOARD

The Board agreed the proposed dates for meetings in 2011 and
asked for a further meeting to be arranged for December 2010.

CLOSE

There being no other business, the Chairman closed the meeting.
