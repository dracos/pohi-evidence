Dear everyone,

Susan and I talked about this work today.

I thought this paper was clear and helpful. I am also glad that on the basis of his conversation with Susan last week, Alasdair
Marnoch thought that the right immediate issues were being tackled in the right way at the right speed.

Thad some thoughts which I want to put on the record about the way ahead.

First, while it is clear that we are committed to using SS for the 47 cases which are already in the frame for their review, it is
extremely important that we cap their involvement at that. The moment they are involved in additional cases beyond these, we will
have lost the ability to end the relationship with them - an outcome which I do not want to have to contemplate. I understand that
this means we have to find a way of satisfying James Arbuthnot and the JFSA that we have a credible alternative way of handling
additional cases. So the sooner we can do this, the better.

Second, we need to pin down and cap SS's costs. I understand from Susan that she has told them that she is expecting them to do the
extra work pro bono but no deal has been done. I understand that Chris will be bottoming this out urgently and that there will be a
cap on any additional payments to them.

Third, we need a proper process for appointing the independent Chair of the working party. We cannot afford to make the wrong
choice here. We need to draw up a clear description of the role and the qualities we are looking for and then interview some people
who appear to fit the bill, and reference them properly (ie conversations not bits of paper).

Finally, I have asked Susan to keep the Board fully informed of future developments and to alert me to anything which she is unable
to resolve which could get in the way of getting the job done in the way it needs to be done.

She will be seeking conversations about all this with all the NEDs on an individual basis and will be in touch with you to arrange
these.

Best wishes

Alice

Apologies all, it should have been this version of the note attached to yesterday's email, which incorporates the insurance
information (at paragraph 31) rather than leave that in a standalone note. It also includes a couple of additional sentences on
accounting arrangements at paragraph 24.

Thanks,
Martin

Thanks Alwen

For the benefit of the other Board members I had a very good review with Susan and Alwen earlier this week focused mainly on the
history and immediate actions we are taking to dealing with the urgent case review. I was reassured by the energy, resource and
prioritisation of the work we are doing and I think it's fair to say on this we are working through as quickly as is practical.

In our discussion with Susan, Alwen explained why the case review was only going back to 2010 and the significance of a Horizon
upgrade (full reconciliations across every site etc). Could Alwen please elaborate on this point as a critical issue will be determining
how far back we need to go.

Also what's the legal position with Fujitsu - do we think they are in any way culpable (and have we had our view verified) and have
we taken any action (noting that they have offered to pay£100k in support of costs)?

Finally I seem to be missing the insurance update - could you please resend.
