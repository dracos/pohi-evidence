Dear Sir/Madame

As previously discussed I am at present in the process of gaining
accreditation in order to become an Accredited Financial Investigator.

assisting and mentoring me.

DC David Rowntree has today obtained the associated Production
Order in respect of Tahir MAHMOOD.

The requested documentation can be sent directly to me at the
