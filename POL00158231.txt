Hello

As you know, the BBC Panorama programme broadcast some very
damaging and unsubstantiated allegations about the business last
night.

We are today assessing next steps, and specifically including whether

“Mark Davies we will take any action through legal or other avenues.

Corporate Affairs

My judgement is that the programme did not produce anything we
were unfamiliar with, but was very one-sided. .

It is welcome, however, that the issue has not so far been picked up
widely by other media.

Please do let me know direct at mark.r.davies:
you or anyone in your team has questions or comments about the

programme. It will have come across as emotive and shocking to those
unfamiliar with the issue. There is much more to it, unreported by the
BBC, but any colleague with any question shouldn't hesitate to raise it.

T hope this is helpful.
