3. New Questionnaire Responses

BC explained that as there had been no comments on the update put forward on 10 April,
PO had started investigations on CQRs submitted last week, subject to WG's confirmation of
suggested deadlines.

Considered by WG on 27/3 - RW and

AVDB have confirmed and agreed that
RW will request further information. PO
suggested a deadline of 6 weeks from

40" April - 22/5 — to allow two weeks
for PA to provide the required

information.

M118

PO noted that this is a very complex
case. The supporting information is
likely to be extensive and therefore the
investigation will take a considerable
amount of time. PO believes this will
take 8-10 weeks and will report back by
5/5.

AVDB to update WG on expected timescale
for investigation at the next face-to-face WG
meeting on 1°! May.

M107: AB explained that he had recently spoken to the applicant who had previously

thought that they had presented all the necessary information. WG agreed that PO
could continue to investigate the case as presented. Funding could be made
available should the applicant require it to seek advice should PO or SS have any
questions.

4. Post Office / Second Sight Investigation Process
New cases passed to Second Sight by Post Office:

MOo76 To be uploaded to Huddle on N/A

WG noted that multiple versions of CQRs

on Huddle is confusing.

M054: TH commented that document JN22 did not appear to relate to the
relevant assertion made in the report.

Actions AVDB:
© to look at evidence doc. and report back at the next WG meeting on 24"
April.
oto .consider numbering conventions so that evidence is sorted in the order
as referred to in the investigation reports.

SS commented that they found the quality of PO’s investigation reports in M054
and across the caseload generally SS to be inadequate. TH suggested that if
that is the case the relevant points should be made in their report for
consideration by the WG at the next face-to-face WG meeting on 1* May.

The WG agreed that even though there were still outstanding questions for M022,
the PO report should be uploaded to Huddle this week in draft, along with M127.
SS anticipate that the additional questions put to the advisor should be submitted
next week (the PA is meeting the applicant today) and PO will amend the report
as appropriate when the responses are received

WG agreed that these three cases reports should be the priority for SS ahead of
the next face-to-face WG meeting on 1 May.
Action: SS to have their reports on M022, M054 and M127 ready for review by

the working group by COP 48 hours before the next face to face meeting on 1
May.

Cases under Post Office Investigation:

Investigations are continuing on all cases but PO is prioritising the review of the
reports already with SS to reflect the discussions at the face-to-face WG meeting
on 1 April 2014. PO aims to upload 8 reviewed cases by 24 April 2014 and the
remaining by 1 May.

Action: AVDB to remove the original reports from Huddle.

TH reminded AVDB to concentrate on what was the loss — and what caused the
loss - within newly drafted reports.

WG acknowledged the amount of work required to review the reports already with
SS that and agreed the requested deadlines (below) but reiterated the need for
speed in resolving these cases and asked that, where possible they be submitted
earlier.
