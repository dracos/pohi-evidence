Subject: Conversation with James

Hello Janet, I think it would be useful to have a short conversation in the near future to
discuss a concern that may arise in the future, before we arrive at that point. I am probably
going to raise the issue with some of the other MPs who have been in touch with me, but I
think it is important to discuss it with James first.

round to the matter to brief James, you can contact me.on

but have a Working Group conference call at 1pm.

It is not desperately urgent but I can see the issue starting to appear in the New Year.

Alan
