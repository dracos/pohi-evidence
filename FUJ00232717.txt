1 Executive Summary

The purpose and scope of this report is to explain how the delivery of the HNG-X services provided by
Fujitsu is currently measured. This report provides POL with information to understand how Fujitsu
currently provides this capability for the live environment.

On 20 August 2020, POL requested an audit of the HNG-X services by sending a letter to Fujitsu titled
“Horizon Audit”. Following a number of discussions between POL and Fujitsu, it was agreed by POL
that Fujitsu would prepare a set of reports on key topic areas identified by POL.

This report explains how the delivery of the HNG-X services provided by Fujitsu is currently measured
(“HNG-A Robustness (Service Delivery Metrics) Report”). It follows the “Expanded Table of Contents
for the HNG-A Robustness (Service Delivery Metrics) Report” (COM/MGT/REP/4162) which was
shared with POL on 09 December 2020.

The adaptation of the HNG-X Counter Business Application (CBA) to work with Windows devices
other than NT4, known as HNG-A, was rolled out with the Branch Counter Refresh in 2017 and 2018.

HNG-X has been built and improved jointly with POL over many years. It is a large and complex IT
solution that integrates with POL and its other third party suppliers. Fujitsu believes that the HNG-X
services it provides are delivered effectively.

A compilation of recommendations for improvement is contained in Appendix D. The list in Appendix
D collates the various action items into a single list so that POL and Fujitsu can work jointly to act on
these recommendations.

POL is invited to comment on this report to seek any additional clarifications it needs. Fujitsu will
endeavour to respond to any comments or clarifications requested and may, if it deems necessary,
provide an updated version of this report.

Fujitsu welcomes the opportunity to provide this report.

2 Purpose & Scope

The purpose and scope of this report is to explain how the delivery of the HNG-X services provided by
Fujitsu is currently measured. This report provides POL with information to understand how Fujitsu
currently provides this capability for the live environment.

POL is invited to comment on this report to seek any additional clarifications t needs. Fujitsu will
endeavour to respond to any comments or clarifications requested and may, if it deems necessary,
provide an updated version of this report.

Fujitsu welcomes the opportunity to provide this report and looks forward to a constructive dialogue
with POL.

3 Background & Introduction

On 20 August 2020, POL requested an audit of the HNG-X services by sending a letter to Fujitsu titled
“Horizon Audit”. Following a number of discussions between POL and Fujitsu, it was agreed by POL
that Fujitsu would prepare a set of reports on key topic areas identified by POL.

The spirit of the discussions between POL and Fujitsu in relation to these reports was to share
content that would allow both organisations to confirm the efficiency of the current ways of working
together, and to identify ways to make meaningful improvements that would enhance the working
relationships and experience for the POL branches and their postmasters. Fujitsu believes in
collaboration and welcomes constructive suggestions from POL.

This report explains how the delivery of the HNG-X services provided by Fujitsu is currently measured
(“HNG-A Robustness (Service Delivery Metrics) Report’). It follows the “Expanded Table of Contents
for the HNG-A Robustness (Service Delivery Metrics) Report” (COM/MGT/REP/4162) which was
shared with POL on 09 December 2020.

The adaptation of the HNG-X Counter Business Application (CBA) to work with Windows devices
other than NT4, known as HNG-A, was rolled out with the Branch Counter Refresh in 2017 and 2018.

Fujitsu operates the HNG-X services to the service standards contractually required by POL.

Fujitsu’s monitoring systems and processes seek to proactively identify faults, log them as Incidents,
and then work to resolve them promptly following the agreed Incident management processes. Fujitsu
also relies on Incidents being reported to them by POL. These reported Incidents are also logged and
worked on to identify their cause and resolution options. Thousands of Incidents have been logged—
as would be expected of a system of this complexity and size.

As a general comment, it should be noted that Fujitsu is only one supplier involved in the overall
delivery of end-to-end services to POL in relation to HNG-X. The HNG-X application also relies on the
working partnership between POL and its chosen partners— such as Verizon, Computacenter and
Atos — as well as external service providers such as banks and affiliated organisations. This applies to
both the IT systems and the operational processes in HNG-X.

Although every effort has been made to avoid confusing technical jargon in this document, the very
nature of this aspect of the service delivered to POL necessitates the use of many acronyms and
phrases that may need expanding upon to ensure the correct understanding. Fujitsu accepts that
further explanation may be necessary and encourages POL to seek these clarifications.

Fujitsu has endeavoured to ensure that the content of this report is correct as at the date of issue.
This report has been prepared with the input of numerous Fujitsu individuals and attribution of any
statements made in this report should be made to Fujitsu only. In preparing this report, the authors
have collectively characterised and summarised many internal Fujitsu documents. They have abo.
described processes and procedures which have been established over many years and may not be
in written form. Many of the documents, processes and procedures described in this report are
continuously updated and Fujitsu reserves the right to make changes to the way it works in the
ordinary course of its operations and business without obligation to update this document. POL should
verify the position with Fujitsu before relying upon any information or content from this document in

the future, as well as bearing in mind the requirements set out in “Information Distribution” at Section
9 below.

4 Approach

Fujitsu acknowledges that it is important to measure the service that is being delivered to POL (and
hence to the SPMs). In doing so, Fujitsu can show how well the HNG-X system is working.

The starting point for any consideration of HNG-X should be to look at the wider end-to-end processes
and platforms.

There are some major factors to consider when reviewing the HNG-X services provided by Fujitsu:
e HNG-X is a large and complex IT solution.

e HNG-X is running on aging platforms — many of which are out of manufacturers’ support — and
this is likely to continue until the migration to AWS has completed

« HNG-X is a dynamic system that is subject to continual change.

POL and Fujitsu have worked collaboratively to create the version of HNG-X in use today based on
the POL defined requirements. The management of the HNG-X services provided by Fujitsu is an
ongoing activity and is necessary to keep HNG-X working. Logging and efficiently dealing with issues,
whether identified by pro-active monitoring or by calls from users, helps to remove or reduce the risk
of re-occurrence. Routinely handling issues assists in supporting the capability of the system and
ensures that the contract obligations and SLTs are met. This is described in the Service Delivery
Metrics sections below.

5 Service Delivery Metrics

This section describes 5 areas that comprise the Service Delivery Metrics:
e Operational metrics — the contracted SLTs and the visibility of system activity metrics.
e Service Operations metrics — the contracted service delivery obligations.

e Key Interactions — the numerous interactions (meetings & reports) between POL and Fujitsu
on key topics that review and influence operations.

e The Reports — the 6 Reports delivered to POL (of which this is one) that provide further
insight into Fujitsu's operations.
e Business Continuity — the obligations Fujitsu holds and how they are reviewed.

POL will have access to other data and information, both from their own systems, and those of their
other suppliers, with which to supplement the contents of this report.

5.1 Operational Metrics

Fujitsu system monitoring (via IBM Tivoli software) is constantly checking platform availability and
events. Events are reviewed by Fujitsu SMC and Incidents are raised. Event data is also used to
report on the numerous Service Level Targets (SLTs) stipulated in the HNG-X contract. The monthly
Service Management Review (SMR) meeting report shows Fujitsu's performance against those SLTs
for the current month and prior months.

Appendix A shows extracts from the January 2021 SMR meeting report.

In addition, Fujitsu developed the Horizon Information Centre (HORIce) to enable its specialist support
staff to see more detailed information on how the HNG-X systems are operating.

HORICce receives events from system monitoring tools and also queries the contents of some HNG-X
data stores to obtain helpful information. This allows visibility into the functioning of HNG-X and not

just whether the system components are operational. Aspects of HORIce are monitored by Fujitsu
SMC who review the information presented and raise Incidents. Although HORIce was developed as
a support tool for Fujitsu specialist support staff, many features have been made accessible to various
personnel in POL. There are currently 238 queries that POL can run to review important metrics
related to HNG-X. POL utilised 66 of the available queries in the month of February 2021. Appendix
B shows the range of queries available to POL. Appendix C shows screenshots from HORIce's
graphical user interface. HORIce provides insight for both POL and Fujitsu into HNG-X with a
combination of near real-time data and historic querying capabilities.

HORIce assists Fujitsu and POL in reviewing and identifying potential issues early so they can be
raised as Incidents and actioned to reduce or remove impact on the systenis performance, availability
or usage, or on branch operations.

5.2 Service Operations Metrics

The Fujitsu service management toolsetis used to record and track Incident, Major Incident, Problem
and Change activities undertaken by Fujitsu. These activities are reported on, and reviewed if
necessary, at the monthly SMR meetings. Important matters are discussed as they occur and do not
wait for the SMR meeting.

5.2.1. Operations Highlights
The SMR meeting report provides an Operations Highlights view showing agreed high-level statistics.

It is worth noting that the second bullet refers to “Incidents where resilience has worked by design and
service has continued”. An important feature of any well-designed solution is a degree of automatic
resilience. This Incident count is included to show the number of occasions when HNG-X has
automatically handled an issue and avoided service impact to POL and/or its branch operations.

5.2.2 Incidents

Incident data is presented to show the work of the Fujitsu Major Account Controllers (MAC) &
Operational Business Change (OBC) teams. Significant Incidents are also listed and discussed.

Incidents raised by POL relating to Fujitsu’s obligations have averaged 26 per month in the last 12
months. Fujitsu understands that the POL IT Digital Service Desk (ITDSD) receives considerably
more Incidents which are not within Fujitsu’s scope of support to resolve e.g. printer issues. There are
no SLTs for Incident management.

5.2.5 APPSUP

At POL's request, Fujitsu also performs non-balance impacting actions to make corrections (such as
stock unit associations, emergency branch opening, or monthly tidying of despatch reports) This
requires the temporary assignment of the privileged APPSUP role (see the “RA Report”
COM/MGT/REP/4165). APPSUP is not used to correct branch balance discrepancies or to amend
financial transactions. The use of APPSUP requires the prior approval of POL.

POL have requested Fujitsu to use the APPSUP elevated privilege an average of twice per month
since January 2020.

5.2.6 Horizon Known Errors Review Forum

POL also operate the weekly Horizon Known Errors Review Forum attended by Fujitsu. Incidents (for
which Knowledge Base articles will have been raised) with the following high-level classifications are
presented at the forum:

¢ SPM Financial Impact - entries containing information which has the potential to cause
financial impact to subpostmasters; and

e SPM Experience - entries containing information which has the potential to impact the
subpostmasters’ user experience.

On average throughout 2020, one new Incident per month was raised at the Horizon Known Errors
Review Forum as having the potential to impact branch operations. A number of these were also
outside of Fujitsu's scope of obligations and needed to be addressed by POL or its third party
suppliers.

5.3 Key Interactions

There are a number of jointly-attended POL-Fujitsu meetings covering a broad array of topics. These
interactions are important. Routinely working well together and acting on actual and/or perceived
issues will help to support the capability of the system. In order to be effective, these meetings should:

* Occur regularly and when scheduled;

¢ Be properly attended;

e Be purposefully chaired;

continuity tests due for the following year, allowing POL the opportunity to review and comment where
required.

The forward schedule is then updated to reflect any comments received from POL. The agreed tests
are subject to change based on business demands / calendar contention, BAU operational issues and
Incidents where resilience has been proven.

A review of the previous month, as well as the forward schedule, should be discussed in a formal
monthly review with POL (ITSCM Progress Management Meeting — formerly Business Continuity
Planning Review). The monthly progress report also goes directly into the monthly SMR report for
discussion at the monthly meeting if required. See Recommendation 4 in Appendix D.

At the end of the calendar year, the 12 reports from the SMR meetings are consolidated into a formal
annual report.

6 Formal Audit Reports

POL commissions an annual ISAE3402 audit as well as quarterly PCI Prioritised Approach audits on
POA. Both audits examine aspects of the scope of this report from slightly different perspectives and
to varying degrees of detail. Furthermore, POA are periodically requested to contribute to internal
Fujitsu corporate audits to support Fujitsu UK in attaining and maintaining a variety of certifications
such as 1S027001, 1SO9001 and 1SO22301.

7 Conclusions

HNG-X has been built and improved jointly with POL over many years. It is a large and complex IT
solution that integrates with POL and its other third party suppliers. Fujitsu believes that the HNG-X
services it provides are delivered effectively.

Fujitsu consistently achieves its SLT obligations and provides a breadth ofinformation to POL, both at
the SMR monthly meeting and via access to the HORIce platform. Through the consistent delivery of
Incident and Change, and by the effective management of Major Incidents and Problems, Fujitsuand
POL acknowledge issues and aim to resolve them promptly. POL CSAT average scores and
feedback from the POL identified functions required to contribute are consistently above 7 out of 10.

POL ITDSD have raised an average of 26 Incidents per month to Fujitsu in the last 12 months and
one Incident on average per month throughout 2020 was raised at the Horizon Known Errors Review
Forum (and some of these were Incidents that needed to be addressed by POL or its third party
suppliers).

There have been eight Major Incidents since January 2020. All actions arising from Major Incidents
were addressed promptly and none remain outstanding at this time.

The privileged role of APPSUP has been used on average twice per month in the last 12 months to
make POL requested and approved corrections.

The Business Continuity obligations are also regularly tested and the forward planning schedule is
reviewed jointly at the monthly SMR meeting.

There is also an extensive schedule of key meetings which allows POL and Fujitsu to work effectively
together to ensure the HNG-X services are delivered efficiently and that issues and ideas are
addressed.

8 Recommendations

A compilation of recommendations for improvement is contained in AppendixD. The list in Appendix
D collates the various action items into a single list so that POL and Fujitsu can work jointly to act on
these recommendations.

Fujitsu strives for continual improvement and is committed to having an open dialogue with POL on
additional recommendations that can be considered as appropriate.
