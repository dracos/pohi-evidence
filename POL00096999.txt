dJarnail,

The attached report, that | produced for the Rinkfield case, contains a section about my qualifications (section 2).

Is that what you need?

| think what you are saying is that you will take that and the report | sent you on Tuesday and re-format it for me to
check. Have | understood correctly or are you expecting me to do that?

Regards

Gareth

Subject: HORIZON FUJITSU REPORT VERY URGENT

Dear Mr Jenkins

Welcome from your annual leave and your assistance advice in the past prosecution cases and I
understand you are assisting my colleagues at present. I need your urgent assist judge has this
morning ordered the prosecution to have the following report ready to be served within Seven days.
On advise Post Office Limited have appointed one of their investigators, Helen Rose as disclosure
officer dealing with Horizon challenges. She has prepared a document/ spread sheet detailing all
such cases, past and present, approximately 20 in total, although none thus far successfully argued in
court. Post Office limited have been advised to obtain, an experts report from Fujitsu UK, the
Horizon system developers, confirming the system is robust. Post Office Limited maintain the system
is robust, but in light of adverse publicity, from legal viewpoint is that defence should be given
opportunity to test the system, should they still wish to do so, on consideration of our report.

You will need to consider the Disclosure officers document/ spread sheet(see attachments) and need
to address in your report the following issues:

1) A description of the horizon system (In laymen’s' terms so that a jury can understand what it is
and what it does)

2) A declaration that it has yet to be attacked successfully.

3) Asummary of the basic attacks made on the system concentrating on any expert reports served in
past cases. If there are none then state that no expert has yet been found by any defence team civil or
criminal to attack the system. (at the moment there seems to be little more than griping by defendants
that the system must be at fault without saying how)

POL-0096582
POLOO096999
POLO0096999

4) Plainly, like all accounting systems, there is room for human error (Keying in wrong amounts etc)
are you able to state that innocent human error is unlikely to produce the types of discrepancies of
many thousands of pounds over many months.

If you require any further information or wish to discuss please do not hesitate to contact me.
Regards
Jarnail Singh
