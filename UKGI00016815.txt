The Board noted the paper, and was updated on the team’s key priorities, which included the
potential for senior management churn in the business; interrogation of POL's five year plan,
and understanding whether it genuinely draws together the strategy, investment needs and
addresses the POL's sustainability; the litigation, noting that trial dates are slipping; the sale of
POL's telecoms business; and the development of its basic bank account offering.

The Board explored the perceived disconnect between BEIS and the board of POL, for

key issues of culture, strategy etc and should not be wasted.

the POL shareholder team and the POL chairman on the annual chair's letter.

The Board agreed that UKGI and BEIS would agree the most important points for discussion
with the POL Chair and then meet with him to clear any differences of view.
