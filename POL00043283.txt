Attachments: Briefing on Gareth Jenkins 14 Nov 2019.pdf

Ben

As mentioned yesterday, we expect the HIT judgment may make some adverse comments about Post Office not calling
Gareth Jenkins as a witness. I'm conscious that you were not involved when these issues were addressed so in case
you/we need to explain this internally at Post Office, we have prepared the attached briefing note that explains the
background to this matter.

In summary:

e Gareth was the main witness about Horizon for many years in many prosecutions for Post Office.

e His evidence gave a firm impression that there were no bugs in Horizon even though there were bugs and he
knew there were bugs.

e This issue was identified in 2013, advice taken from Cartwright King and further disclosures given in line with Post
Office's prosecution duties.

e Given the above problem, we could not call Gareth as a witness in the HIT. This left us to rely on other
witnesses, principally Torstein Godeseth who performed very badly in the witness box. As a result the Judge may
also draw adverse inferences from us not calling Gareth.

Kind regards
Andy
