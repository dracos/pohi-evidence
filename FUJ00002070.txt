RMGA Information Security Policy

FUJITSU Commercial in Confidence

1. Introduction

1.1 Context

This policy is applicable to the Fujitsu Services Royal Mail Group Account (RMGA). For the
purpose of this document, the terms Fujitsu Services Royal Mail Group Account or Fujitsu
Services Royal Mail Group Account Staff shall (unless indicated otherwise) include all
employees and contractors engaged by Fujitsu Services and its subcontractors to the extent to
which their activities are relevant to the delivery of Services.

Section 5 of this document sets out the Executive Information Security Policy Statement for the
RMGA which, together with the Framework of Controls in sections 6 to 15 (collectively the
Information Security Policy) satisfy the contractual requirement for an ISO/IEC27001:2005
based Information Security Policy.

This policy complies with Post Office Limited's (POL) Community Information Security Policy for
Horizon (CISP) (Ref: RMPOLOO2CISP); Fujitsu Services Manage Information Security Policy
(Ref: CPM34); and Fujitsu Services Security Master Policy (Ref: CPM20).

2 Information Security Policy Development

This information security policy has been developed from the Fujitsu Services Horizon Security
Policy version 12 (ref: RSPOLO2) and has been updated to reflect the provision of the HNG-x
Service as well as being structured in accordance with ISO/IEC27001:2005.

Although the organisational and management policy statements contained within this policy will
apply to the whole of RMGA, the technology and operational control statements are based upon
requirements for Services provided to POL. It is likely that this policy will be updated at its next
review to include relevant statements for Services provided to Royal Mail Group (RMG).

2.1 Purpose

The policy applies to all RMGA Staff and is mandatory. Failure to comply with the policy will be
regarded as a disciplinary issue and may result in disciplinary action.

This Information Security Policy sets out management direction and support for information
security, along with minimum standards to be met by RMGA, consistent with
ISO/IEC27001:2005, contractual commitments and relevant POL requirements as expressed in
CISP (Ref No 16).

This Information Security Policy:
e Provides a statement of executive commitment and support for information security;

e Provides a framework of controls within which the Services will be developed,
implemented and delivered by RMGA in all areas of its business;

e Identifies the information security awareness and education requirements for all RMGA

Staff;
e Outlines the requirements for business continuity management as related to information
security;

RMGA Information Security Policy

Fe)
FUJITSU

Commercial in Confidence

e Describes the compliance, audit and management arrangements over information
security and the action that may be taken should this policy not be followed; and

e Allocates information security responsibilities.

2.2 Information Security

Information is an asset, which, like other important business assets, has value to an organisation
and consequently needs to be suitably protected. Information security protects information from
a wide range of threats in order to safeguard customers and staff, ensure business continuity,
minimise business damage and maximise operational efficiency.

Information can exist in many forms. It can be printed or written on paper, stored electronically,
transmitted by post or using electronic means, shown on films, or spoken in conversation.
Whatever forms the information takes, or means by which it is shared or stored, it should always
be appropriately protected and is subject to the provisions of this policy document.

Information security is characterised here as the preservation of:

* Confidentiality: ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorised to have
access;

e Integrity: safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing
methods;

e Availability. ensuring that authorised users have access to information and associated
assets when required.

Information security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of countermeasures, including
policies, practices, procedures, organisational structures and technical measures. Therefore by
using an Information Security Management System (ISMS), this provides a systematic approach
to managing sensitive company information so that it remains secure. It also encompasses
people, processes and IT systems

3 Scope

3.1 Statement of Scope

This Information Security Policy specifies mandatory information security requirements to be
applied throughout RMGA in the provision of its Services to Post Office Limited. The scope of
this policy includes Horizon and HNG-x. Internal Management Systems and Internal Support
Systems are also covered by this policy.

This Information Security Policy covers all activities undertaken by RMGA in the provision of
these Services including design, development, deployment, operation and support of Services,
as well as the programme management, stakeholder management, governance and
administrative procedures applied by executive management to oversee those Services.

This Information Security Policy document describes the overall strategy for providing
information security and is based best practice as defined by ISO/IEC27001:2005.

Information security risks within Post Office sites that are outside of the scope of the Services
provided by RMGA are excluded from the scope of this Information Security Policy.

RMGA Information Security Policy

he)
FUJITSU Commercial in Confidence

The objectives of effective information security risk management are:

¢ To facilitate the overall management of security risk for Information Systems and IT
related equipment, networks and applications for RMGA;

e To generate and maintain an accurate and current Information Security Risk Register for
information assets which support The Service;

e Tocreate and maintain a Statement of Applicability; and

e To provide appropriate management information in relation to Information Security risk
and ensure that this is co-ordinated with the RMGA Business Risk management process.

4.1 Information Security Risk Assessment Approach

Risk Assessment will form a key component of the RMGA Information Security Management
System (ISMS).

A formal information security risk assessment methodology will be adopted that is suited to the
RMGA ISMS, and the identified business information security, legal and regulatory
requirements. The risk assessment methodology will be selected by the Fujitsu Services RMGA
Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and shall ensure that risk assessments produce
comparable and reproducible results. Full details of the risk assessment methodology can be
found in RMGA Information Security Risk Management Approach (Ref: SVM/SEC/STD/0006)

The RMGA CISO will establish criteria for the management of information security risk. In
addition to security risk management and containment, there will be criteria for accepting risks
and identifying the acceptable levels of risk and these will be maintained and reviewed at regular
intervals. Security risk acceptance criteria will be developed in accordance with the RMGA
Business Risk management process.

Risk Assessments will be conducted on a regular, at least annual, basis and additional risk
assessments may, where necessary, be carried out to determine appropriate controls for specific
risks.

Information assets, within the scope of the ISMS, will be identified and recorded along with the
owners of these assets. The asset ‘owners’ will participate in information security risk
assessments conducted by, or on behalf of, the Chief Information Security Officer.

The RMGA CISO will establish and maintain an information security risk register and will
produce a Statement of Applicability (Ref: SVM/SEC/MAN/0001) which will define the controls
which must be implemented for all areas of the RMGA lifecycle management, in accordance
with the Information Security Policy, and in compliance with ISO/IEC27001:2005.

Fujitsu Services will work with the customer, where appropriate, to agree appropriate
countermeasures commensurate with the value and nature of the business risk. The risk
acceptance criteria need to be agreed with Post Office Limited.

All identified information security risks will be recorded in the RMGA information security risk
register and those which require further mitigation will be recorded in a Risk Treatment Plan
(RTP) (Ref: SVMSECPLAO001) which will include planned mitigation actions and next review
dates. Risk treatment criteria must be agreed by the RMGA Information Security Review Board,
and documented in the risk treatment plan. It may also be appropriate for recorded information
security risks to be incorporated into corporate, business or project risk registers. The risk
treatment plan may be used by internal auditors or IA inspection and feeds into the Statement of
Applicability (SOA) for ISO/IEC27001:2005 auditors.

Traceability, based on the outputs of the risk management process, is needed to ensure that
RMGA can determine why a given risk management decision was taken, and the RTP should be
able to demonstrate the following:

Commercial in Confidence

All physical perimeters of Fujitsu Services RMG Account sites will be clearly defined. Site
security personnel at Fujitsu Services RMG Account sites will maintain an appropriate level of
control over the physical security perimeter of each site deploying security barriers, entry
controls, CCTV, security fences, special lighting etc. as necessary. This being backed by regular
visits by corporate Fujitsu working with Fujitsu Services RMG Account site to maintain the
appropriate levels of physical security ensuring no gaps or weaknesses are introduced.
Datacentres providing processing facilities for Post Office data will have much higher levels of
physical security than general offices not withstanding the need to protect sensitive information
that may be stored at these offices.

CCTV footage will be stored on appropriate Digital media for a period of no less than 3 months
on a rolling basis. Thereafter stored offline in a secure location.

RMGA CISO is responsible for ensuring that appropriate physical and environmental controls
are in place, based on risk assessment, to protect assets from unauthorised access, damage and
interference.

Consideration must be given also to any security threats presented by neighbouring premises.

Intrusion detection alarm systems must be used for installations which are left unattended.
Intrusion alarms may be connected to a security company or the Police. Alarm systems and
must be tested regularly and maintained to manufacturers’ requirements.

9.1.2 Physical Entry Controls

Full details of Fujitsu Corporate Policy can be found in Identification Cards and Physical Access
Control (Ref: CS2).

Site security personnel shall control access to all Fujitsu Services RMG Account sites. All
Account staff, whether permanent or contract, will be required to produce a valid security pass
for that site before being allowed access to the site. Access rights must be removed immediately
when the holder leaves the employ of RMGA, whether through leaving permanent employment
of Fujitsu Services or due to re-assignment to other tasks.

Visitors to RMGA premises must have a RMGA sponsor, who must be responsible for that visitor
whilst they are within a RMGA facility. All visitors to Fujitsu Services RMG Account sites are to
be issued with a “visitor's badge”.

RMGA visitors to Post Office Branches must be subject to RMGA vetting procedures and
approval by Post Office Ltd.

9.1.3 Securing Offices, Rooms and Facilities

RMGA employs a best practice approach to securing offices, rooms and facilities across all sites,
including a clear desk policy. In practice this means:

* Access to all secure areas is strictly controlled by the use of security facilities;

e All papers, discs and portable media that contain RMGA ( POL) Information are to be stored
in an appropriately secured place when not in use

e PCs and workstations are to be protected by passwords and, either locked or a password-
protected screen-saver invoked when not in use. Screens are to be timed-out whenever left
inactive for a specified period based on formal risk assessment as defined in the Operational
Use of IT & Communications Systems (Ref: ITS2)

FUJITSU Commercial in Confidence

e Support functions and equipment e.g. photocopiers, fax machines must be sited
appropriately within the secure area to avoid demands for access which could compromise
information;

« Doors and windows must be locked when unattended and external protection must be
considered for windows particularly at ground level; and

e Directories and internal telephone books identifying locations of sensitive processing facilities
must not be readily accessible by the public.

« Physical access to network jacks, wireless access points, gateways and handheld devices is
restricted.

e The use of portable wireless devices, including 3G phones, is forbidden in areas where
sensitive data is stored, processed or transmitted.

9.1.4 Protecting Against External and Environmental Threats

Detailed policy for Physical and Environmental security of Data Centre environments is included
in Fujitsu Services Data Centre Security Policies.

The selection and design of a secure area must take account of the possibility of damage from
fire, flood, explosion, civil unrest and other forms of natural or man made disasters. Account
should also be taken of relevant health and safety standards. Consideration must be given also
to any security threats presented by neighbouring premises.

Hazardous or combustible materials must be stored securely at a safe distance from a secure
area. Bulk supply such as stationery must not be stored within a secure area until required.
Fallback equipment and backup media must be sited at a safe distance to avoid damage from a
disaster at the main site.

9.1.5 Working in Secure Areas

Information processing facilities for Post Office Limited data must be housed in secure areas.
Information processing facilities managed by RMGA must be physically separated from those
managed by third parties. Physical and logical segregation of RMGA Assets from other Fujitsu
contracts must be maintained, however shared use of data centres, server rooms and
environmental facilities is permitted. Security measures associated with installed equipment
must take these factors into consideration to reduce RMGA’s risks to an acceptable level.

Similar considerations apply to RMGA Assets at other non-RMGA sites (e.g. AP Client sites).

Managers responsible for secure areas must ensure that access rights to secure areas are
regularly reviewed and updated.

Unoccupied secure areas must be physically locked and subject to periodic checks, and there
must be physical protection and guidelines for those staff working in secure areas.

Access to sensitive information and information processing facilities must be controlled and
restricted to authorised persons only. Authentication controls (e.g. swipe card plus PIN) must be
used to authorise and validate all access. An audit trail of all access must be maintained
securely.

9.1.6 Public Access, Delivery and Loading Areas

Public access to RMGA sites will be through main entrances.

All equipment containing storage media (for magnetic media see para 10.7.2) which may have
been used to store RMGA sensitive data must be checked to ensure that all sensitive data and
licensable software has been removed or securely overwritten prior to disposal or re-allocation .

Data and licensed software must be erased from IT equipment prior to its disposal. Care will be
exercised as ‘deleted’ data can in certain instances be retrieved using specialist equipment.

Where data or licensed software cannot be erased for technical reasons, the hard disk, floppy
disks, etc, must be destroyed by appropriate means, e.g. shredding, degaussing or in extreme
cases incineration, to prevent data retrieval.

As a minimum, hard or floppy disks must be reformatted, overwritten with ‘0’ and ‘X’ and then
reformatted again. Where confidential or secret data has been stored on the disk, or where for
technical reasons it cannot be overwritten or reformatted the disk must be destroyed as follows:-

e Floppy Disks - Shredded, Degaussed or Incinerated
e Hard Drives - Degaussed or Incinerated
e Tape Reels - Degaussed or Incinerated
e Cartridges - Degaussed or Incinerated
e CD/DVD - Abrasion, Compacting or Incineration

11 Access Control

The objective of this section is to prevent unauthorised access to RMGA facilities, computers,
information and network Assets.

11.1 Business Requirement for Access Control

11.1.1 Access Control Policy

Access to all information assets must be controlled on the basis of business and security
requirements. The purpose of this section is to define the access control policy for Royal Mail
Group Account.

This Access Control Policy defines how access to information system resources is controlled in
the RMGA and the delivery of The Service. It covers the Services provided by RMGA to POL,
including Data Centre systems; RMGA managed systems such as interface systems at POL
Branches and closely related RMGA systems. Access may be the result of direct user action, or
automatically initiated activities.

Procedures for the implementation of the principles of this access control policy, which include
lower level detailed access rules, can be found in the associated access controls joint working
documents [Ref: SDM/SVN/MAN/0027 for Horizon and Ref: TBC for HNGx]

The main principles of this access control policy are:

e Physical and logical access to the IT systems must be controlled, with access granted
selectively, and permitted only where there is a specific need.
e The principle of “least privilege” must apply to restrict the access rights of users whether
human or non-human.
e Information must be appropriately separated in filestore, database tables etc.

Each data set must be accessible only to those with a need for that acce:

e All access to RMGA systems will be specified in terms of roles.

« Individuals in specified roles will be permitted to carry out defined functions and
access specified data.

« Some users may be permitted to carry out more than one major function, so are
permitted to take more than one “role”. This is not permitted in cases where
security may be undermined.

e Access controls associated with resources must define the “role” of the user, not
the individual user's identity.

« Access controls associated with resources must provide access to the resources
as in the role definitions guideline document.

« Access controls must take account of legal and contractual obligations regarding
access to data and services (see Section 15).

e Access controls must take account of policies on information classification (see
7.2) and separation of duties (see 10.1.3)

« Access controls must take account of distributed and networked environments
including all types of connection to each asset.

e Access to RMGA information processing facilities by third parties" must only be
for the time needed

e Accountability of individuals is essential and segregation of duties must be enforced.

« There must be segregation of access control roles, e.g. access request, access
authorization, and access to assets.

e Users are individually identified so that they can be made accountable for their
actions.

« Multiple individuals will not share access credentials, or be required to share
access credentials due to deployed technical solutions.

e All users must be authenticated to IT systems. This authentication must identify them as
individuals.

« Help Desks must maintain the information required to authenticate the callers
and their Branches/offices as required for the type of call. If the call needs to be
passed onto another internal RMGA help desk, the call must be forwarded only
after the initial authentication has been carried out.

e Wherever authorisation is given orally, normally over a telephone link, additional
verification methods must be used.

« Where possible RMGA operations will be automated to reduce the need for human
intervention and the potential accidental and malicious security breaches that could
result from human activity.

« System management tasks must be automated where practical. This includes
taking remedial action where the results of monitoring the system show this is
needed. Only where action cannot be taken automatically, or human verification
of an action is needed, must human intervention be required.

e Facilities must be used to restrict access to computer and network resources on
a need-to-know basis.

e Initial default accounts must be renamed where possible.
e Initial default passwords must always be replaced by secure passwords.

e All access to RMGA systems will be monitored

e Access to RMGA information processing facilities by third parties must be controlled.
e There must be a demonstrable need for third party access.

e A risk assessment must be carried out to determine the security implications
and control requirements for any forms of physical and electronic access by
third parties.

e Any third party access to transaction data must be “read-only” and must not
breach the confidentiality requirements of this policy.

e On-site third parties must be identified and documented.

e All security requirements resulting from third party access or internal controls
must be reflected in the third party contract. Where there is a special need for
confidentiality of the information, non-disclosure agreements must be used.

e Access to information and information processing facilities by third parties must not be
provided until the appropriate controls have been implemented and a contract has been
signed defining the terms for the connection or access.

e The safety and security, including confidentiality, of access credentials is the
responsibility of the each individual issued with the credentials and of those issuing the
credentials.

11.2 User Access Management

11.2.1 User Registration

There must be clear user access processes which include:
e identity management;
* formal authorisation of access requests;
e periodic review of access;
* removal of access rights
Records of all persons registered to use RMGA systems must be kept, though the way this is
done may be role or service dependent.

11.2.2 Privilege Management
The allocation and use of privileges shall be restricted and controlled.

The principle of Least Privilege shall be used to limit permanent access, and to use minimum
default access permissions.

The system will maintain the clearances and authorisations granted to users, and access to
information will be consistent with users’ clearances and privileges.

Access to System Administration accounts will be strictly controlled. Knowledge of the
passwords and authentication for system administrator accounts will be restricted to the
authorised system administrators.

System administrators will be allocated and use a unique identifier, and the passwords will be
subject to more frequent refresh than normal user account standards.

The use of system administration accounts will be kept to a minimum.

Segregation of responsibilities will ensure that no privileged user can cover up unauthorised
actions, and a continuous record of all system administration commands, and the use of
powerful system utilities, will be maintained securely.

11.2.3. User Password Management

There shall be a documented process for the issue of user passwords. This process is to ensure
that passwords remain private to the user.

Passwords will be stored in a one-way encrypted form.
Passwords shall be chosen to conform to the following criteria:

« Where passwords are used for authentication, the user must be forced to change the
initial password before any other access to the system is permitted.

e Passwords must expire in 30 days.

e Re-use of the same password must not be permitted for either a specified time or until at
least 4 other passwords have been used.

« Passwords must be a minimum of 7 characters long and must be alphanumeric (i.e. a
mix of letters and numbers). There must not be more than two consecutive identical
characters. The password must not be the same as the username.

e After 3 consecutive unsuccessful attempts to log-on, the user must be locked out for at
least 30 minutes or until reset by an administrator

e In general, system users must be subject to the controls specified above. The following
exceptions are permitted:

e The username and password used to automate the login may be held in clear if it is only
accessible to authorised operational management staff for that system and the potential
damage from misuse of that username is minimised.

* The password may expire less frequently than the 30 days for human users where
suitably obscure passwords are used, e.g. strong passwords consisting of upper case,
lower case characters, numbers and symbols and the risk of external access to such
accounts is very low. (This is also referenced in 11.5.3).

11.2.4 Review of User Access Rights

RMGA will conduct a formal review process at regular intervals to review user access rights.
These reviews shall be carried out at least annually, and include revalidation of user access
rights and privileges granted to users. In environments with sensitive data, a process must be in
place to remove accounts that have been inactive for more than 90 days

11.3 User Responsibilities

11.3.1. Password Use

System Administrators, service desk personnel and any other individuals capable of resetting
passwords shall not reveal passwords unless the information owners or authorised users have
first provided definitive evidence substantiating their identity.

Additionally, resetting procedures shall ensure that users comply with the following:

« Change Passwords that are subject to any possible compromise or suspected security
breach;

e Change Passwords regularly to be within their life span before reaching their expiry; and

« Change Passwords temporarily assigned by the helpdesk immediately on first use.

11.3.2 Unattended User Equipment

All Fujitsu PCs, workstations and where possible mobile devices e.g. PDAs, will be configured to
automatically lock after a preconfigured period of time to prevent unauthorised use. The system
shall require that the Identification and Authentication process is repeated to unlock the device
before work can be continued.

RMGA Staff will manually lock their PC, workstation (and where possible mobile device) or log-
off before leaving it unattended for extended periods.

A warning screen, which is displayed prior to log-on at PCs and workstations, will warn the reader
that unauthorised access to systems may result in disciplinary or legal action being taken.

For Services provided to POL after a period of inactivity at a Post Office counter, the session will
time out but can be resumed on entry of the password. After a longer period of inactivity, the
user is forcibly logged out.

11.3.3 Clear Desk and Clear Screen Policy

RMGA employs a clear desk and clear screen policy across all sites. Employees are required to
ensure that whenever they leave their desk unattended during normal working hours all sensitive
information is protected from unauthorised access by others.

11.4.2 User Authentication for External Connections

Authentication, whereby a user's claimed identity is verified, is essential before any access is
granted to any RMGA system. Authentication mechanisms are required to ensure that trust
relationships can be established between communicating components within, and external to,
RMGA Services.

All HNG-x Service connections with remote computer systems will be authenticated. The User
or application that initiates a transfer shall be authenticated by both the destination and the
source node. Authentication must be successful before any transfer is executed.

11.4.3 Equipment Identification in Networks

Automatic equipment identification will be considered as a means to authenticate connections
from specific locations and equipment.

11.4.4 Remote Diagnostic and Configuration Port Protection

Access to diagnostic ports must be securely controlled to ensure they are only available to
approved persons at approved times.

11.4.5 Segregation in Networks

Controls in the Data Centre must reduce the possibility of interference between systems by
separating independent parts of the system, particularly those which have different security
requirements. (This may be by a combination of network set-up, router controls, controls at ports
of specific systems and Microsoft domain structure.) For example,

« RMGA management sites must separate their main networks from both the Fujitsu
Corporate network and from those more secure Local Area Networks (LAN) used to
access the Data Centre e.g. viaa DMZ

e Systems concerned with Outlet Business Change must be separate from those used for
operational running.

e Security services, e.g. the Key Management Service (KMS), must be protected from
unauthorised access from other systems.

e Traffic originating within the RMGA Data Centres is generally initiated by controlled
applications. These applications (and the way they are configured in the system) must
restrict traffic between systems to the minimum necessary.

11.4.6 Network Connection Control

Local users must only have access to specific LANs that provide access to local services and
(via controlled connections) to the Fujitsu Corporate network.

The only permitted connections from the RMGA management site network must be:

e To the Fujitsu Corporate network via a controlled router, suitably firewalled and which
restricts traffic to specifically authorised traffic only;

® To Order Book Control (OBC) users at regional offices and OBC suppliers at their sites
via a controlled router and firewalls.

e® To the secure LANs via a firewall which restricts data to that permitted (e.g. software
from the Configuration Management system).

The only permitted connections from the secure LANs must be:

e To the Data Centres via encrypted links.

e To other secure LANs via an encrypted link (i.e. between the RMGA management sites).
All users with any interactive access to the Data Centres must do so via secure LANs

e Separate secure LANs must be used for separate user groups/activities where Company
Secret/Strictly Confidential data is being handled at RMGA management sites. For example,
Security Management and Audit users must be on a separate high security LAN from other
users.

e Servers at the RMGA management sites that Company Restricted/Confidential data or are
used to update the Data Centre require stronger security and must therefore be on a secure
LAN.

11.4.7 Network Routing Control

All access in and out of the RMGA Data Centres must be restricted to the required traffic from/to
the authorised sources/destinations for business and system traffic using routers and firewalls.
Such traffic must be routed only to the ports at systems which require that traffic. The following
controls will apply:

e All management and support users will access the Data Centres (and other managed
systems) from controlled workstation environments.

e All RMGA Corporate management, system management and support sites with access
to the main operational systems must have fixed links to the Data Centres.

e External support users with access to any of the RMGA systems containing sensitive or
protectively marked information must access the systems via controlled workstations
and environments as for RMGA support staff, but subject to extra controls. (Support of
routers is an exception — see below).

« All fixed links must be protected by the use of hardware encryption devices.

e Firewalls and Routers must be configured to deny access to external users, (including
support or maintenance users) until this access has been agreed. When permitted, the
appropriate router must be configured to restrict access to the Data Centre to the
particular system(s) needing support.

11.5 Operating System Access Control

11.5.1 Secure Log-on Procedures

Access to operating systems will be controlled by procedures that request the user to log-on
using approved, valid credentials. Where access is granted to Horizon or HNG-x Service
applications, this will be supported by two-factor authentication. Should authentication fail the
system will not indicate which attribute of the authentication process caused the failure. All
access to operating systems for HNG-x shall be subject to monitoring and audit. Passwords must
not be transmitted in clear text over any network

for Fujitsu Services systems Minimum Password Security (Ref: TS2.1).

11.5.4 Use of System Utilities

RMGA will ensure that access to system utility programs will be restricted. Only members of
specific administrator groups will be permitted access. System logging will be enabled to provide
audit of all attempts to gain access to these utilities.

11.5.5 Session Time-out

All Horizon and HNG-x user terminals will be configured to automatically lock after a
preconfigured period of time to prevent unauthorised use. The system shall require that the
Identification and Authentication process is repeated to unlock the device.

11.5.6 Limitation of Connection Time

All Horizon and HNG-x user terminals will be configured to automatically disconnect if there is no
user activity in a preconfigured period of time following session time-out.

11.6 Application and Information Access Control

11.6.1 Information Access Restriction

Access to applications hosted and managed by RMGA will be restricted in accordance with the
access control policies set out in this policy document.

RMGA service support-users will not normally have access to financial information contained in
Horizon or HNG-x Services.

11.6.2 Sensitive System Isolation

Fujitsu Services policy Security of Portable Equipment (Ref: ITS/9) outlines the controls required
to ensure that care is taken to avoid loss of company equipment or data.

Where remote access is required to RMGA systems remote users will only connect through an
approved remote access facility. As a minimum, this facility will:

e Provide a secure means of authentication of users in addition to identification and password;
and
e Strongly encrypt any data passing across public networks.

Where access involves connection through a third party network, users must be provided with a
personal firewall. Users must also be provided with a facility to enable them to update anti-virus
software to the latest version before receiving any e-mails.

11.7.2 Teleworking

RMGA Staff will only use teleworking facilities with the prior approval of RMGA management.
The teleworking facilities will be secured to a level no less than other RMGA office environments

12.1 Security Requirements of Information Systems

12.1.1 Security Requirements Analysis and Specification

Assurance during development must be supported by the definition of security requirements,
security architecture, detailed security design, design reviews and security testing.

Statements of business requirements for new information systems, or enhancements to existing
information systems must specify the requirements for security controls and must include the
Fujitsu Services relevant security requirements from the Community Information Security Policy
and this Policy.

Security requirements and controls will reflect the business value of the information assets
involved and the potential business damage, which might result from a failure or absence of
security.

Specifications for the requirements for controls must consider security of the automated controls
to be incorporated in the information system, and the need for supporting manual controls.
Similar considerations shall be applied when evaluating software packages, developed or
purchased, for business applications.

System requirements for information security and processes for implementing security will be
integrated in the early stages of information system projects.

If products are bought in, a formal evaluation and procurement process must be followed.
Contracts with suppliers must address the security requirements.

Capacity requirements must be included in requirements analysis to avoid failures due to
inadequate capacity. Future capacity projections must be made to ensure that processing

Checks must be applied to the input of business transactions, standing data, and parameter tables.

12.2.2 Control of Internal Processing

Validation checks shall be incorporated into applications to detect any corruption of information through
processing errors or deliberate acts. The design and implementation of applications will ensure that the
risks of processing failures leading to a loss of integrity are minimized.

12.2.3. Message Integrity

An assessment of security risks shall be carried out to determine if message integrity is required
and to identify the most appropriate method of implementation.

12.2.4 Output Data Validation
Output validation must be applied which checks for:
e plausibility;
«reconciliation - control counts to ensure complete processing of all data;

¢ — sufficient information is provided to determine the accuracy, completeness, precision,

Digital signatures provide a means of protecting the authenticity and integrity of electronic
documents. All keys used for signing data must be afforded levels of protection equal to or
greater than the highest levels of data signed.

Encryption key management must be independent of network configuration such that the
confidentiality of Post Office Ltd traffic is not compromised by a single configuration error of
either the WAN or the encryption system.

All cryptographic keys must be protected against unauthorised use, modification, loss, and
destruction. In addition, secret and private keys need protection against unauthorized disclosure.

Equipment used to generate, store and archive keys must be physically protected.

It must be possible to recover the system to a secure operating state from the compromise of
any key that could directly or indirectly expose plain text PIN values.

12.3.2 Key Management

A structured approach to Key Management will be implemented across all Services provided to
POL. The following controls will be implemented to protect cryptographic keys and RSA keys:

e Key material (symmetric keys, DSA private keys and DSA entropy) must be held in clear
only when in physically secure environments.

e Public keys (except for the Certificate Authority's (CA) public key) must be held in
certificates signed by the Certification Authority.

e Symmetric keys must only be stored where necessary, and be held securely.
e PIN encipherment keys must not be used for any other cryptographic purpose.

e Keys (or part keys) held in filestore must be in a separate filestore accessible only to
authorised key custodians via authorised applications.

e Keys used for protecting data must not be resident in filestore in clear.
e Replay of encrypted PIN values will be prevented.

e Keys must be changed periodically according to Government Specified Algorithm policy
or, where commercial algorithms are employed, in accordance with industry recognised
timescales. Different periods may apply to Symmetric Keys used for encrypting data,
Key Encryption Keys (KEKs) used to encrypt other keys and Certification Authority keys.

e New KEKs must not be distributed solely under the protection of existing KEKs.

e Key material in transit electronically must be encrypted (except for CHAP keys between
the routers within the RMGA Data Centre LAN).

e Cryptographic keys are either installed locally at the machine where they are to be
used, or are distributed electronically using an approved protocol which protects these
keys in transit.

e Where a key is delivered in two parts, e.g. a red key and a black key, the parts must be
delivered by different routes.

e Ensure information security events and weaknesses associated with RMGA
information systems are communicated in a manner allowing timely corrective
action to be taken and as referenced in SVM/SDM CS/PRO/018.

e Ensure a consistent and effective approach is applied to the management of
information security incidents.

An information security Incident is: "an adverse event or series of events that compromises the
confidentiality, integrity or availability of RMGA information or information technology assets,
having an adverse impact on Fujitsu Services reputation, brand, performance or ability to meet
its regulatory or legal obligations." This will also extend to include assets entrusted to Fujitsu
including data belonging to Post Office Ltd, its clients and its customers.

13.1 Reporting Information Security Events and
Weaknesses

13.1.1 Reporting Information Security Events

Information security events must be reported through the RMGA Service Desk as quickly as
possible.

A formal information security event reporting procedure must be established, which includes an
Incident response and escalation procedure, setting out the action to be taken on receipt of a
report of an information security event.

Incidents that threaten Cardholder Data and Sensitive Authentication Data must be acted upon
as outlined in the PCI Incidence Response Plan (Ref...)

FUJITSU Commercial in Confidence

All security incidents reported to the Service Desk must be logged and given a reference and
handled in accordance with the security incident management procedure.

All RMGA Staff will be made aware of their responsibility to report any information security
events and suspected breaches as quickly as possible.

13.1.2 Reporting Security Weaknesses

RMGA has established effective procedures for reporting, acting upon and escalating all security
incidents/ breaches that could affect security. It is the responsibility of all users of the RMGA
services and RMGA personnel to use these procedures. [Ref: CS/PRO/018]

All security weaknesses must be recorded with a unique reference number, investigated and
resolved in accordance with these procedures. Where appropriate the Operational Security
Manager or CISO will liaise with Post Office Security staff to review relevant incidents and
actions.

If RMGA Staff identify or suspect that a security weakness exists anywhere in the RMGA system
then they must report these matters to the RMGA Service Desk, or direct to the Operational
Security Manager, as quickly as possible in order to prevent information security Incidents.

All RMGA staff must be aware that they should not, in any circumstances, attempt to prove a
suspected weakness themselves. If such a course of action resulted in a security Incident then it
may be treated as a disciplinary issue.

13.2 Management of Information Security Incidents and
Improvements

13.2.1 Responsibilities and Procedures

In addition to reporting of information security events and weaknesses, the monitoring of
systems, alerts, and vulnerabilities shall be used to detect information security Incidents.

Procedures for reporting, acting upon and escalating all security incidents/ breaches as
described in CS/PRO/018 that could affect security will include:

* analysis and identification of the cause of the Incident;
* containment;

* co-ordination management, planning and implementation of corrective action to prevent
recurrence, if necessary;

*® communication with those affected by or involved with recovery from the Incident;
* reporting the action to the appropriate authority;
e documenting in detail all emergency actions and

* ensuring that the integrity of business systems and controls is restored with minimal
delay.

The information gained from the evaluation of information security Incidents shall be used to
identify recurring or high impact Incidents.

The RMGA Operational Security Manager must carry out a check of all security Incidents
investigations on a regular basis and create a summary report highlighting all security incidents.
The report must also highlight any trends or weaknesses which may need to be raised at future
Security Forums.

13.2.3 Collection of Evidence

Where a follow-up action against a person or organization after an information security incident
involves or may involve legal action (either civil or criminal), evidence will be collected, retained,
and presented to conform to the rules for evidence laid down in the relevant jurisdiction(s). Legal
action may also be initiated by 3° parties e.g. by regulatory bodies or controllers of potentially
compromised sensitive data.

Should it be considered necessary the incident might be passed to an external investigator or
forensics team, who will ensure that any data required for evidential purposes is captured and
investigated using a systematic approach which ensures that an auditable record of evidence is
maintained and can be retrieved

Incident investigation procedures ensure that evidence is collected such that it is admissible and
of sufficient weight by keeping original documents, copies of information held on hard discs,
removable media and log files.

14 BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT

The objective of this policy section is to counteract interruptions to RMGA business activities and
to protect critical business operations from the effects of major failures of information systems or
disasters and to ensure their timely resumption.

14.1 Information security aspects of business continuity

14.1.1 Including information security in the business continuity
management process

A managed process must be developed and maintained for business continuity throughout
RMGA.

The RMGA Business Continuity Manager is responsible for ensuring that a process is
implemented to minimize the impact on the RMGA and delivery of The Services and recover
from loss of information assets. This process will identify the critical business processes and
integrate the information security management requirements of RMGA business operations with
other continuity requirements.

The RMGA Chief Information Security Officer will be involved in the development and
maintenance of the process, and any continuity plans, to ensure that information security
requirements are adequately addressed.

14.1.2 Business continuity and risk assessment

FUJITSU

Commercial in Confidence

Events that can cause interruptions to business processes shall be identified, along with the
probability and impact of such interruptions and any consequences for information security.

The consequences of disasters, security failures, loss of service, and service availability must be
subject to a business impact analysis.

Business continuity management will include controls to identify and reduce risks, in addition to
the general risks assessment process, limit the consequences of damaging incidents, and ensure
that information required for business processes is readily available.

14.1.3 Developing and implementing continuity plans including
information security
A Business Continuity Plan must be developed and implemented to ensure timely resumption of

essential operations. Information security will be an integral part of the overall business
continuity process.

RMGA Business Continuity Manager must ensure that an effective business continuity plan is
agreed with RMGA Security staff and implemented to reduce the risks from deliberate or
accidental threats to deny access to vital services or information including deliberate loss of
confidentiality and integrity of RMGA assets.

Plans must be established, and maintained, to enable internal operations and business services
to be maintained following failure or damage to vital services, facilities or information.

All relevant security provisions must be maintained, even if degraded conditions are in effect. If
alternative temporary locations are used, the level of implemented security controls at these
locations should be equivalent to the main site(s).

In order to minimise any disruption to the Services managed by RMGA, continuity plans will
encompass:

e Handling emergency situations;
© Operating in fall-back mode;
e Recovery (or Business Resumption) to full operational status
e The escalation plan and the conditions for its activation; and
e Responsibilities for executing each component of the plan.
Business continuity plans will address RMGA vulnerabilities and therefore may contain sensitive

information that needs to be appropriately protected. BC Plans must be stored off-site in secure
conditions but readily available in the event of the need to activate them.

14.1.4 Business continuity planning framework

The Fujitsu Services RMG Account will maintain a framework of business continuity plans,
integrated with Fujitsu Services Corporate plans and, where appropriate, with the plans of the
customer ensuring that all plans are consistent, and to identifying priorities for testing and
maintenance.

14.1.5 Testing, maintaining and re-assessing business continuity
plans

The RMGA Business Continuity Manager is responsible for ensuring that the BC Plan is regularly
reviewed.

The identification of changes in business arrangements not yet reflected in the business
continuity plans will be followed by an appropriate update of the plan. This formal change control
process will ensure that the updated plans are distributed and reinforced by regular reviews of
the complete plan.

Business continuity plans must be tested under representative operational conditions and
updated regularly to ensure that they are up to date and effective. The test schedule for business
continuity plan will indicate how and when each element of the plan will be tested. External
suppliers of key services must be included in tests to ensure that risks are minimised, wherever
RMGA is dependent upon subcontractors (or third parties), for essential services or supplies.

Tests of business continuity plan will ensure that all members of the recovery team and other
relevant RMGA Staff are aware of the plans and their responsibility for business continuity and
information security and know their role when a plan is invoked.

The RMGA Business Continuity Manager and Chief Information Security Officer must be
satisfied that continuity arrangements of external suppliers of key facilities and services are
sufficient to ensure that RMGA will meet its contracted commitment for information security to
the customer.

15 COMPLIANCE

RMGA is required to comply with legislative requirements and commercial standards. The
controls defined in 1S027001 are designed to provide a sound baseline for commercial
organisations of many types.

Through the implementation of this policy, RMGA will apply 1S027001 to provide a baseline
definition for information security encompassing the eleven categories of controls in the context
of the RMGA Service.

The RMGA Information Security Policy will encompass and comply with all security aspects of
customer requirements as defined in relevant Contract Schedules and the Community
Information Security Policy, where appropriate. Being a high level policy, in many cases one
policy statement may cover a number of the detailed requirements as laid down in these
schedules.

15.1 Compliance with legal requirements

Fujitsu Services is required to comply with legislative requirements and technical and
commercial standards in its own right as a business organisation. In addition RMGA provides a
managed service for POL; in this case POL may have additional legal and regulatory
requirements imposed upon them. These legal and regulatory obligations are passed down to
RMGA within the contractual agreement as specific implementation requirements and as such
are not specifically covered in this document. Relevant POL requirements as expressed in the
CISP have already been included within the specific policies, which are mandatory.

15.1.1 Identification of applicable legislation

FUJITSU Commercial in Confidence

It is the customer responsibility to explicitly define, document, and keep up to date all relevant
statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements for each information system and provision of
facilities to enable the customer to discharge its own legal and regulatory obligations must be
explicitly provided through requirements statements in the normal way.

RMGA will document its approach to meet these requirements.

Implementation advice on Fujitsu's legal responsibilities is provided by Fujitsu Group Legal
department.

15.1.2 Intellectual property rights (IPR)

The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 states “The owner of the copyright has the
exclusive right to copy the work." It is illegal to copy software without the copyright owner's
permission.

Proprietary software must be used within the terms of the licence conditions. Unauthorised
copying of software and documentation is prohibited.

Where practicable vendor-supplied software packages shall be used without modification. If
changes are deemed necessary, these should first be requested under change control to the
original supplier and implemented as an upgrade from the supplier.

RMGA will not permit any modified or non-standard software components to be incorporated.

An inventory of all proprietary software used by the Services will be maintained.

15.1.3 Protection of organisational records

Records stored electronically and hard copy will be accessible throughout the required retention
period and will be safeguarded against loss due to future technology change as referenced in
CR/FSP/006.

Data will be retrievable to meet legal requirements as requested by a court of law, e.g. records
required can be retrieved in an acceptable timeframe and in an acceptable format.

15.1.4 Data protection and privacy of personal information

It is Fujitsu Services’ clearly stated policy to comply with all laws and regulations relating to the
protection of personal information in all countries in which it transacts business and to maintain a
high standard of compliance in all its worldwide operations.

All applications handling personal data on individuals must comply with data protection
legislation and principles. RMGA shall process personal data only in accordance with the
instructions of each Data Controller as set out in the Agreement and applicable provisions of the
Service Description CCDs dealing with such processing.

15.1.5 Prevention of misuse of information processing facilities
Users shall be deterred from using information processing facilities for unauthorized purposes.

Under the Computer Misuse Act, it is an offence to access or modify material without proper
authority, or to access material with intent to commit further offences. Warning notices to this
effect must be displayed to potential users prior to system log-on.

15.1.6 Regulation of cryptographic controls

RMGA will only use cryptographic techniques within the Services that are compliant with POL
cryptographic policies and standards as referenced in CISP.

15.2 Compliance with security policies and standards and
technical compliance

15.2.1 Compliance with security policies and standards

Compliance with the requirements defined in the RMGA Information Security Policy is
mandatory. The policy is to be applied throughout RMGA for the secure management and
operation of all systems and Services designed, built, implemented, operated, used, supplied or
managed by the Fujitsu Services RMG Account.

Regular audits are carried out under the direction of RMGA CISO and/or RMGA Programme
Assurance Manager, to verify that RMGA is operating in accordance with its security policy and
procedures.

Security Audits can also be initiated by Post Office Limited, its clients or regulators either in
response to a specific incident or on a regular basis.

These audits will form part of an overall assurance programme and will be scheduled and co-
ordinated as part of an integrated audit programme.

Where relevant, RMGA will comply with customer security requirements as expressed in the
Community Information Security Policy. They do not need to comply with requirements in the
CISP addressed specifically to other parties.

15.2.2 Technical compliance checking

RMGA Information systems must be regularly checked for compliance with security
implementation standards and regulatory requirements. Technical compliance checking involves
the examination of operational systems to ensure that hardware and software controls have been
correctly implemented. An external auditor will annually audit the card holder environment to
ensure compliance. This type of compliance checking requires specialist technical assistance. It
shall be performed manually (supported by appropriate software tools, if necessary) by an
experienced system engineer, or by an automated software package which generates a technical
report for subsequent interpretation by a technical specialist.

Compliance checking also covers, for example, penetration testing, which might be carried out
by independent experts specifically contracted for this purpose. Caution should be exercised in
case success of a penetration test could lead to a compromise of the security of the system and
inadvertently exploit other vulnerabilities.

Any technical compliance check shall only be carried out by, or under the supervision of,
competent, persons authorised by the RMGA CISO.

Technical compliance checking will form part of an overall assurance programme and will be
scheduled and co-ordinated as part of an integrated audit programme.
