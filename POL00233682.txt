Dear Jane and Rodric,

Thank you again for the instructions on this matter.

As mentioned in the course of the consultation yesterday, I have had a stab at preparing a list that can be the
starting point for deciding what the terms of reference should be. It is a little rough and ready, and is very much a
draft, for discussion. However, I thought it would be better to get something to you sooner than later, so the process
of consideration can begin. As you will see I have drafted a list the is wide enough to cover everything that could
have been done in response to the complaints. We can then check this against what we have already done, and
form a view as to what we need now.

I am in court today, but should be back in chambers by 4.30-ish. Otherwise I am back in chambers on Monday
morning.

Regards,
Jonathan
