Dear Colleague
Bates v Post Office Ltd

As you are no doubt aware, the first stage of the Bates v Post Office Ltd group
litigation began last month. This first stage relates to the legality of the
contract between Post Office Ltd (PO) and postmasters, and whether PO have
acted in accordance with the contract when suspending or terminating a
contract when shortages have been discovered through the audit process.
We can expect the judge's decision in mid-January 2019.

We are aware of posts and discussions on social media relating to the trial
that are not only negative towards PO, but negative towards the NFSP as well.
The items I have seen personally are invariably one-sided and driven by a
minority of individuals with an anti-NFSP agenda.

It is essential to note that the NFSP is not involved in the case in any capacity.
Indeed, neither defence nor prosecution counsels have approached the NFSP
for any comment or submission.

As investors in the network, we subpostmasters obviously wish to ensure that
the contract we hold with PO is legal - and that they are discharging their
responsibilities accordingly. However, right now, the NFSP believes the most
important issues are those affecting the colleagues - past and present - who
are involved in the litigation. Accordingly, as an organisation, we wish to allow
the full legal process to take place without interference.

Once the judge has reached a decision, the NFSP will provide comments.
Until that point, we do not believe it would be appropriate or productive to do
so.

Yours faithfully
