Torstein,

Your summary thinking is correct. NS and FS know it as the KEL (known error log).
I have attached two spreadsheets one is what I understand as the summary KEL and the other is the detailed incidents
found in S50 that FS proposed to be deferred to a future release. These were reviewed with NS and they agreed to the

deferral proposal. These therefore become part of the new KEL from S50 going forwards. New incidents may be added to
the KEL from live running and some incidents may be fixed during live running so the KEL is an ever moving beast.

Hope this meets your request
Regards

Peter

Peter,
Can you just confirm my model of the 'known problems list’ with FS.

1. I think it is ‘owned’ by Network Support.

2. At the end of a wodge of testing you provide back to Network Support a new KPL; some faults will have been taken
off, because they are fixed and others will be added because you've found them in latest testing.

If this picture is generally correct can you provide an example of a KPL that you've handed over?

Kuman,

I suggest as a starter that you provide Torstein with a current position by an agreed date.
We can then discuss with him an ongoing process and perhaps if you suggest your thinking this may fit the bill.

Yes, I think we have.

The "known error list " that I manage is via the defect management process. We maintain and monitor all defects raised
by POL. I also record defects raised by EDS on EDS where we think it somehow may impact our customers or customer
service so that we can look for evidence when these are fixed. After each release we carry out a cleaning exercise so
that EDS and POL have common understanding of outstanding defects. These defects eventually get addressed in
subsequent releases - depending upon who and how hard one pushes these.

A lot of outstanding defects or "known problems" have been assigned to POL ie design authority and awaiting
resolution. I must admit, during last two months, I have not been rigorous at chasing all the outstanding defects but I will
put this right in next two weeks.

I am not aware of any other system for maintaining "error list" but I would like to manage it through Defect management
process using Test Director and not create yet another spreadsheet favoured by some!
We may need to slightly change the way we manage defects on TD to accommodate what Torstein may have in mind.

DO you want me to speak to Torstein to agree an approach or is there another approach that you want me look at?.

Kuman,
Do we not already have this ?.

I would have thought there was an agreed list that gets updated during live running and is part of the potential scope of
the next release.

Peter,
A favour I think. I have never quite got to the position of having a ‘known errors list’, as I think we have for FS, with EDS.
I believe that Kuman and Jim would be just the men to tidy this up and get us into a common model.

Kuman and I have discussed on a number of occasions but we've never quite closed down. Can we have a quick chat
about this sometime?

Regards etc
Torstein
