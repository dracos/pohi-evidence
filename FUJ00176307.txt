It is important that any duplicate messages in the retrieved audit data are highlighted to the user.

Duplicates are not being hightlighted when two message sequences have the same start and end message
sequence numbers.

ie. Sequences 2708181 to 2708188 and 2708181 to 2708188 would not be reported as duplicates.

Sequences 2708181 to 2708188 and 2708183 to 2708183 would report a duplicate.

part of the function of the audit client is to analyze the message sequences and report on any issues. Gaps in the message
sequences are reported clearly to the user but duplicate message numbers are not reported clearly.
