I'm happy with this. Please provide the draft email ASAP and in parallel we should brief Laura on the proposed route
through.

Many thanks

Thanks - “final” letter now attached, which BD will keep in draft until we ask for it.

{ have also asked BD for their thoughts on how to share this with BNR, with the initial view being to send
it as is under an email recording the common interest BNR and ShEx have in its privileged content (e.g.
along the lines set out in Jane's 7 September 2015 letter to BNR). However, whether we do this or
prepare a second, open letter will also depend on what BNR may do with the letter and the information
it contains (e.g. keep it confidential or update Lord Arbuthnot).

To resolve this, Patrick and I have agreed that he’ll join up with our public affairs colleagues on Monday
then speak to BIS. Once we have their input, we should be able to draft something up for Tim fairly
quickly.

Does this work for you?

Rod

Many thanks — agree it looks to be in the right place. My only query was whether, at Para 4, we could we
substitute ‘essentially’ (or similar) for ‘broadly’, or drop the qualification entirely, in terms of the overlap
between the two exercises ? It’s no biggie, but I guess my concern is to reduce to the fullest extent

possible, any risks associated with a possible suggestion that we have narrowed work;

Vl call you shortly. For future ref, best number for me is always.

Jane, Patrick — please see the revised BD letter to POL summarising Tony Robinson’s advice on Jonathan
Swift’s recommendations, which I think looks good.

If you agree, Patrick ~- can you please give me a call (I can’t find your number!) to help draft the email to
Tim which attaches the letter and a suggested email from him to BNR?

Thanks, Rod

RE: first para, could we do this — “Mr Jonathan Swift QC was engaged by Post Office to advise the
Chairmen on this review”?

Re: the sixth para, does this work?:

Mr Robinson's “very strong advice“ was that Mr Parker's review should cease immediately. This would
help preserve the privilege in Mr Parker's review, and particularly the implementation of Mr Swift's
recommendations by Mr Parker, and protect against the risk that material related to these actions could
be disclosed to the Claimants in the Group Action, undermining Post Office's prospects of success and /
or negotiating position.

Hi Rod

I have made the changes we discussed save the first one in the second para as I believe the original
wording is correct.

Let me have your proposed amends to the sixth para and once agreed I can slot them in.

Kind regards
