Reference: - Losses and Gains
Dear Alan,

I have carefully considered the explanations offered by you in your reply of 15" May
2003, about your failure to make good losses as required under the terms of your
contract for services, Section 12 Paragraph 12 refers. However I do not consider
that these explanations justify your continued failure to make good such losses. I
feel therefore that I must give you a final opportunity to comply with the terms of your
contract for services.

The letter you received from Mike Wiatrowicz, Management Information, Birmingham
dated 6" March 2002, clearly stated:

‘After due consideration of the facts surrounding the loss and of your report,
Post Office Ltd has decided to take no further action in respect of the loss at
your post office which will be written off. This decision has been made without
prejudice to Post Office Ltd’s rights to recover any future losses at your post
office for which you may be liable under the contract for services and does not
affect any future liability you may have for such losses.’

POL-0002469 E1/40/1
POL00004629

You must clearly understand that unless you comply with these terms and make the
losses good immediately and cease the practice of rolling over losses and gains, I
will have to seriously consider the termination of your contract for services by means
of three months notice.

Please sign and note one copy of this letter and return to myself at the above
address by Friday 13" June 2003.

Asecond copy is enclosed for your retention.

Yours sincerely

Retail Line Manager
Post Office Ltd
