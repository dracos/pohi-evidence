and concerned West Byfleet Post Office.

Page 14 covers my response to a problem that had been identified in an earlier case (that involving Lee Castleton who
took POL to court for unfair dismissal which he lost).

Do you need me to dig out anything more on this? _I think the key point is that the fact that Horizon did have bugs has
been discussed in court and POL still won the case.

Regards

Gareth
