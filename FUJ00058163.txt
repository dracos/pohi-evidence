Managing Directors Summary

1 SUMMARY

e This has been another difficult month for Pathway, BA and POCL.
There have been further programme delays and difficulties with
Release 1c and the-potential release date for Release 2. This has
caused further damage to the business cases of all parties and within
the Sponsors there is a body of people who are pressing and
looking for away out of the contract.

° On Release 1c there were problems with the second model office
rehearsal run which will require a complete. re-run moving the go
live date frorn the 13" October to the 3" November. This would
still allow the 200 Post Offices:to go live on this release by
Christmas providing that we.have relatively fault free period from
now on which leads to no further delays. In addition we still need
to.secure PDA.acceptance that Release. 1c is suitable for roll-out to
the full number. of offices and the key issue here will be to do with
agreement on security exclusions.

° Major reviews throughout the month have taken place on Release 2
which rules:out any chance of delivery in March 1998. Until we
have resolved with PDA outstanding issues not currently in the
Release Content Definition, on issues surrounding joint testing and
reflecting the.impact of outstanding work on, Release 1c, we have
declared no forecast for this product beyond the fact it will,not be
before June 1998,

° We have resisted engaging in any commercial discussion around
these new planning évents prior to setting a.firm-and robust
forward plan.

e The independent review conducted by PA has led to the publication
of the draft report which is in poor shape in terms of clarity or
recommeridation. This is admitted as such by PA who have the
target of a sharper definitive version by 19 September.

° We are beginning to form views. as to the construction of a Release
3 product focusing on POCL business requirements which.may
need a new approach and involve a separate development team.

The present plans leave POCL waiting :too.long before they can
address their competitive commercial-issues in the-market place.

° As well as progressing the known products for Release 3 we are
recommending an aggressive move in the bill payment market place
whereby Road Shows can.be mounted to their existing client base
to enthuse them about the future and offer more competitive
treatment in the short term.

e We have used the month to demonstrate the completeness of the
products'we have to as many audiences as possible across POCL,
BA and the PDA. This has been extended to all ICL Pathway staff
for very similar reasons and the next step is to do the same for the
Programme Steering Committee which meets here later in
September.

e We are working closely with ICL CFM on. their outsourcing bid for
National Savings in which POCL can be incorporated as a more
active member and can perhaps add some value to the opportunity
in winning this bid.

2 PROGRESS

e We now have approximately 170 Post Offices running live services
through IGL and Release 1b. The target is to increase this to just
over 200 by the end of September which will then provide the basis
for the upgrade to Release 1c when this has been approved.

The Service Performance and System Performance of these live-sites
continues to be good.

© — Work has started on building a robust plan for Release 2 and initial
builds-have taken place in order to begin. the first phase of testing.
Lessons from Reléase 1c are being applied both in Test Strategy,
Configuration Management and Change Control.

© Work is continuing to complete the gap analysis between whatiis in
the current.Release Contents Description for Release 2 and the total
contract responsibility as signed off in May 1996. This is to ensure
that we have final acceptance of the system except where explicit
exclusions have already been signed off by both parties.

° Consent has now been acquired from the.Sponsors to the funding
arrangements although there-remains some hopefully small items of
legal issues to settle.

. On the International Sales front the most significant achievement
has been with Derische Post A.G. where the presentation at Board
Level was well received and the likely out turn is that they will
select Riposte for their next generation of ‘counter systems and will
also require services from ICL Pathway and FJ/ICL Germany.
Confirmation of this is expected by:the end of September.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

° Critical work is needed on security, PINICL clearance and
agreement on exclusions in order for Release 1c to go live in early
November on the full 200 Post Office sites.

ICL Pathway Pathway Programme Monthly Report Ref: PA/REP/0014
Version: 1.0
Managing Directors Summary I Date: 12/09/97

° The Release Content Description, RCD for Release 2 is urgently
needed in order that a forecast date can be constructed which in
turn is acceptable to the PDA, the Sponsors’and ICL Pathway and
can be achieved on commercial terms which are agreed by all.

e We have a major task in bringing all our supplies.in line to yet
another re-plan which will cause them dismay and cause’ us
collective pain.

e Very little progress has been made on benefit roll-out and its impact
on customer education‘and although sufficient has been done to
complete 1997 tasks this whole area will need to be addressed
within the terms agreed for the new re-plan.

¢ Work continues to find the right solution for the Post Office outlets
where ISDN cannot be provided.

4 ISSUES

° Pressure is mounting from POCL.for us to consider how'to deliver,
conventional EPOS (i.e. as in the retail world) along side the Post
Office and BA delivered functionality.

We need to convince the customer that this cannot be done easily
and is a serious distraction at this point in time and will have to be
addressed carefully on a more prolonged. time table. We will need
to show that this is a rational approach and that we do have-a way
forward.

° POCL are moving very slowly to get their organisation in‘place to
support their tasks in achieving the infrastructure roll-out and Post
Office preparation work.

. The lack of a strategic-way forward with An. Post/Escher is
presenting us with confrontation in our International activities
which are difficult to keep under control or keep invisible'to the
prospective clients.

This can create potential risks for:the reputation of ICL.and Fujitsu.

The challenge is to make progress with care and sensitivity but
nevertheless this issue must be resolved this:year.

Programmes Report

1 MONTHLY SUMMARY

© Two major activities have consumed the resources of the teams’ during
August. Namely final testing of Release 1C and planning for the new
Release 2 (Nile.2.0) based. on the proposal made by Pathway in July.

° Problems have occurred in Release 1C MOR2 (Model Office Rehearsal)
with the Recall and Reissue Process (RRP) for cards and payments. This
process is enacted by a suite-of programmes provided by Oracle that have
been found to-contain faults. Plans to.rectify the faults and test the suite
of programmes have been: put in-place and MOR2 will restart once the
faults have been proven to be fixed.

e The target daté for completing MOT has moved by three weeks from 6"
October to 27" October. Implementation of the IGL sites plus an
additional 190 sites is still possible-priot to Christmas if agreement can be
reached with the PDA/POCL that rollout to the 190 sites can be.completed
in 2'weeks. Any‘further delay to Release 1C would cause implementation
of the 190 sites to move into 1998.

e The reviews carried out in Auguist of the plans for Nile 2.0 have concluded
that a release date of 30" March 1998 is no longer tenable. The key
reasons causing the date to be unachievable are:

Invalid assumptions on the acceptability of deficiencies
between the Nilé 2.0 release contents and. the contract (e.g.
EVP Phase 2).

Identification ofthe need for extended testing anda new
approach based on experience to date.

The impact of slippage to Release 1C target dates and 1C
deficiencies (defined in the KPR - Known problem: Register)
that require fixing in Nile 2.0.

As a result Pathway are not forecasting a release date for Nile 2.0.

e The no forecast position has been reviewed with POCL and PDA. Whilst
concerned that it marked an, as yet, undeclared slip in the Nile 2.0 release
date they understand the reasons. PDA have:agreed:to work with Pathway
to ensure a release date can be forecast in the second half of October
where the drivers and risks leading to the date are understood. Pathway
will then need to manage the programme to ensure the date is met.

2 PROGRESS

e All level 1 and- Management handshakes are being reviewed and will be
included in the next monthly report.

2.1 GENERAL

° Progress has been made in Technical and Security testing such that:all tests
have been run. Outstanding faults with code, builds and procedures are
being fixed and regression tests are planned to be complete by the
completion of MOR (targeted for 29™.September).

° Considerable work was undertaken in agreeing with.PDA a series of
exclusions to Security functuality ‘at Release 1C with appropriate
mitigation. Security testing has identified further exclusions. Until thesé
are agreed with the PDA and the complete set formally accepted by the
sponsors they could impact the willingness of PDA to accept Release 1C
for rollout.

e A process.has been defined and implemented for analysing and agreeing
with PDA the business impact of Release 1C PiniCLs that will not be fixed
in that release. These are captured in the KPR (Known Problem Register)
for resolution in Nile 2.0 and beyond. Until all resting (including
MOR/MOT) is complete, associated PinICLs analysed and the KPR
complete we will not getconfirmation from PDA. that they will accept
Release 1€ for rollout.

e — Anew function called the Product Integration Team (PIT) has been
established to ensure products are integrated into a build and checked to
be working prior to being put under the control of CM. Itis expected this
will both reduce problems associated with building systems used in testing
and managing.the status.of their content. This function has been used to
establish the-initial builds for Nile 2.0 testing based on Release 1C and
early functionality originally planned for old Release 1e.

e  PCMS has now been established and is starting to’be used as the
Configuration Management tool for Release 2.

eA gap analysis exercise has been established to identify the-gap between
Pathway’s contractual commitments and work-commissioned: for release-in
Nile 2.0. This is schedules to complete at the end of September.

¢ There are now 158 outlets operating Release 1B (OBCS) in the Post Office
network. 210 are targeted to be available by the end of September to
ensure more than 190 are available'for Release 1C-rollout (in addition to
the 10 IGL sites). The rollout of these Post Offices’ is being used as‘a
“learning” exercise to validate.and improve rollout processes. .All lessons
learnt to date have been incorporated. ‘

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEM

¢ Completion of Release 1C MOR/MOT post resolution of the RRP suite
faults.

e Completion of Security Testing and.agreement of the exclusions and
mitigation’s.
¢ Completion of PinICL analysis-and agreement of the KPR.

e Agreement of release contents for Nile 2.0 including resolution to the
requirements for EVP Phase 2, Security and the Non-ISDN solution.

° Agreement on the testing approach to be adopted for Nile 2.0.

e Given the pressures on key managément staff and testers working:on
Release 1C ensuring the final testing and PinICL clearance for Release 1C
is fully staffed whilst ensuring sufficient resource to continue development
and réfinement of plans for Nile 2.0.

4 ISSUES

e —_ Despite.an ongoing recruitment exercise not all positions identified have
been filled. The Nile 2.0 replan will lead to an increased requirement for
resources.

e@ — Not all CCNs/CARs have been reflected in the contract and there are
outstanding Agreements to Agree. These need resolving before a full
contractual baseline:can be established.

e The management of expectations of the PDA and sponsors as .new options
and dates for Nile 2.0‘are established. Ensuring decisions on release
contents and timescales reflect the true business drivers of BA, POCL and
Pathway. .

5 COSTS

° Costs have continued to rise to cover the need for extended testing and an
MIS warehouse capability. The full costs for delivering the programme
based on the new Nile 2.0 release will not be able to be baselined until the
end of October.

Commercial & Financial Report

1 MONTHLY SUMMARY

Another very difficult month for the programme. There is no disguising
the perception that we.are in the dock forthe latest-slippage and the fact
that. the:damage to business cases all round is immense. On the plus'side,
our new openness .and.realism about the-state of the programme has been
met with a positive response from the other side and a preparedness:to
work with us to find a way through.

One key item of good.news is that BA and POCL have now agreed in
principle the Asset Co. financing arrangements. We are engaged in
finalising the terms of the ICL Pathway and ICL plc undertakings, the.
objective being completion and draw down this week. As at time of writing
there is just one outstanding matter to resolve.

Relationships among the finance and commercial community remain
strongly positive.

Expect suppliers to be seriously destabilised by news of the latest slippage.
This will need very careful handling, and soon.

2 PROGRESS

e Apart from the financing agreement (in principle) icis‘difficult to. find areas

of real progress. The summary describes them.

All level 1 and Management handshakes are being reviewed and will be
included in the next monthly report.

2.1 EXTERNAL, WITH PDA

2.1.1 CNT

We have now agreed to drop down all aspects of CCN105 which have
been agreed (about 99%) and to ring-fence those which are not (AO6 and
B7). This will give-us-a clean baseline against which we can all work with
confidence and will describe the “agreements to-disagree” with respect to
pricing and CAPS milestone dates. The new contract will incorporate all
CCNS up to.and including CCN105 and make-the updating of the contract
for subsequent CCNs very much easier than hitherto. It'will also clarify the
list 6f controlled documents. All useful and positive:housekeeping. There
is a recognition that resolution of the disagreements on AO6 and B7 will
have to wait until a-new contractual framework is negotiated to reflect the
new programme plan. Meanwhile we lose nothing by waiting.

ICL Pathway Pathway Programme Monthly Report Ref: PA/REP/0014
Version: 1.0
Commercial & Financial Report . _ Date: 12/09/97. __

The impending movement in:the programme plan has been discussed in
directional terms but no more. No commercial positioning has been trailed
by us or by them. It is recognised that theré is no point‘in engaging on this
until we have a clearer view of what a robust new plan might look like.
The need for robustness and confidence has been stressed in no uncertain
terms.

The CNT team of the PDA reviewed and then recommended that-the
sponsors approve the Asset Co. financing-arrangements. Pat Kelsey has
personally worked extremely hard to sell the proposition within BA -
which she has now secured.

Limited progress (but sufficient for 1c) has been made on customer
education. The ultimate impact of phased. benefit roll out will depend in
part on the extent of slippage in post officé roll out, so is another
candidate for sweep up into a new commercial deal around a.néw replan.
It,remains an. Agreement to Agree.

CAS commercial terms and-the definition of SLA monitoring boundary
have still to be agreed, but we are inching closer. It-remains an Agreement
to Agree.

2.1.2 JCCB (JOINT CHANGE CONTROL BOARD).

Again, no meeting held. The PDA have never implemented the one-control
process described in the Contract. Strange'when there are so many issues
around change and Agreements to Agree. Something to consider: should
we call for JCCBs to be held?

2.1.3 FINANCE AND COMMERCIAL FORUM:

Continues to meet and work well and to deal with many lower level issues.

Subjects dealt’ with.afe increasingly on the.service management side:
reconciliation, fraud risk transfer scenarios and processes, SLA issues,
invoicing, etc., but also on implementation (eg. rules for making post
officés fit for automation), options for War Pension card roll out, and
many more.

Other areas include the brokering of difficult CCNs, CARs (eg. securing
data from CAPS sufficient for EVP), and Agreements.to Agree.

2.1.4 ACCEPTANCE PROCESS FORUM (JIM MORLEY LEADING FOR COMMERCIAL):

Progress still stalled because of more pressing priorities. A significant
amount of work remains to be done, including rework to reflect changed
baselines.

2.2 EXTERNAL

e  Wehave deliberately refrained from discussion on new commercial terms
and also from launching a defence with respect to slippage or release
cofitent deficiencies.

e  We'know that the BA and POCL business cases have been badly damaged
and that there are-elements within both organisations which.are now
looking for out or at.least are thinking about alternatives. BA will maintain
that they have not slipped since the last replan in April (CCN105):
essentially true as far as we can tell.

e We have rehearsed our case for the defence but not yet presented it. The
argument goes that late CARs, Agreements to Agree.and CCN sign offs
have contributed directly to the-delays. We could reasonably argue that
Drop Down implied that all CARs and Agreements to Agree should have
been resolved within three months of contract signature. There are
weaknesses in.this argument:

We have not been good at flagging the key
dependencies/risk areas ahead of time, or then driving
the customer to deliver on his part of the bargain;

We have not always been timely in producing the
proposition when it fell to us to do so;

‘We have tended to be lax on change control disciplines;

The extent of our slippages since the replan in April
suggest a certain lack of integrity in our planning which
undermines the assertion of such dependencies;

Delay against dates we have signed up to when. others
are holding to theirs tends to undermine the cause and
effect linkage.

In each case, we must strive to improve our
performance.

e  We:have talked to the PA Consulting people and seen their draft report. It
is not yet clear that any useful recommendations will come through.

2.3 EXTERNAL, WITH SUPPLIERS

© We will have to ré-baseline all over again. It will not be easy.

2.4 INTERNAL TO ICL PATHWAY

¢ The new baseline has only been scoped in rough business case terms, not
yet worked through in detail. The answer does not make attractive
reading, so I'll leave it at that for this month.

Commercial &.Financial Report Date: 12/09/97

e The: forecasting process has been imiproved, but struggles to keep up with
incessant change. The one positive thing that can be said is that we are
expending less cash than.was predicted a short time ago, and have.had
some success in reducing the. forecast rate of spend.

e There has beer a lot of discussion about what functionality we are
required to deliver into RN2. The.short answer is (if we read Rle for RN2,
because contractually 1e is still the baseline),.everything in the
Requirements, Service Definitions (including SLA monitoring), Schedules
{eg. AO6), the SADD, SFS and all other controlled documents apart from:

AP Smart,

On-line CAPS related services (temporary tokens,
emergency stops and payments, card carrying casual agents
per CCN‘117),

“soft” EVP (ie. the reference data driven invocation facility)
Customer education beyond Ric.

° Our rights with respect to outstanding Agreements to Agree, CARs and
those CCNs which are forced upon us (eg. CCN118) is that we are entitled
to alleviation on timing of delivery. Doing so requires that we ourselves
have worked hard to reach agreement (put forward proposals in timely
fashion, etc.), that we have declared in writing the need for agreement in
advance of any given drop-dead date, and made clear in advance. what the
impact of delay would be+(ie. exclusion from the relevant release or
extension of time for getting the release out). Providing we can show that
we have-done all of those things, we have a strong case for negotiating out
content. What we are not entitled to do is to unilaterally declare via the
Release Contents Definition that certain functions will be-excluded.

e Areas which may yet afford an opportunity for-alleviation (and therefore
exclusion) :are:

audit/reconciliation
fall back/contingency
reference data

EPOS menu heirarchy

CAS service.boundary SLA measurement (new commercial
boundary)

e —_6n the grounds that they are not yet agreed. Jim Morley or I may be able
to help put the case together, and will be happy to do so. Well versed ideas
for additions to the list would be welcomed. Theré may be scope within
the list of CCNs not yet signed. off by the customer (numbering some 35).

Customer Requirements Report

1 SUMMARY

The PinICL inventory is now under numerical and management control
and two of the root causes for it, the MOR2 scripts and the Oracle ‘RRP’
problems, have been addressed. Progress ori most other activities is. being
maintained, particularly requirements defiriitions for later versions of the
Benefit Payments-Service and new POCL and overseas business.

2 PROGRESS

All level 1 and Management handshakes-are being reviewed and will be included
in the next monthly report.

2.1 POST DROP DOWN

No activity.

2.2 DETAILED PLAN ACTIVITIES

2.2.1 CURRENT ACTIVITIES

2.2.1.1 RELEASE 1

The various aspects of getting the PinICLs (incident reports) under
numerical and management.contro] has.consumed the majority of efforts
of the Requirements team this month. The PinICL system itself is not
ideal for the relatively large numbers involved and is optimised at
transferring responsibility for a problem rather than focusing on its
resolution.

At one point, just prior‘to the halt of MOR2, the combined traffic from
primary testing, which had not completed, and from the Model Office
threatened to run out.of control. The hiatus in the Model Office activity
and the approaching, end.of testing has allowed us to get control back; and
in particular sort out the scripts the Model Office is using.

The 1c-known problem register (derogations).has beén maintained
through five versions: it currently comprehends 31 General and 54
Security PinICLs, 48 of which are covered by agreed Security Exclusions.

FUJ00058163
ICL Pathway Pathway Programme Monthly Report Ref: PA/REP/0014
Version: 1.0
Customer Requirements Report Date: 12/09/97

There are currently 385 PinICLs outstanding with Pathway of which about
240 are resolved awaiting clearance. Some 25 are expected to be resolved
by an Oracle fix (‘RRP’) and some 25 were caused by the MOR2 scripts
being used not being targeted at Release 1c. How is.it that CAPS Testing
can write scripts for’ Model Office without seeing a Release 1¢.RCD?

Looking at the PinICLs raised by the.customer from Model Office. activity
and Joint Business Tests (and excluding any Security items) there are
currently outstanding 31 Category 1 (must fix) and 33 Category 2 (should
fix).

2.2.1.2. RELEASE 1/2

Workshops on Test Threads for Release 2.have been-held.

The PDA comments on SADD Version 3,1, which should
be next to none, are now overdue.

A revised version of the Audit Trail Functional Specification was output
for agreement.

Tony H has resolved problems in the download of DSS Reference Data.
The whole file was being rejected because mandatory fields were absent -
notably post codes:on some Post Office records: It transpired that the file
incorrectly included post offices for the Isle of Man, and the Channel Isles,
which do not have post codes, but are not even within the scope of the
Pathway solution.

2.2.1.3 RELEASE 2/3

A new baseline CAPS to.PAS/CMS Data Interface Definition & Validation
Rules document for CAPS Release 3 (DIDVR) was produced by CAPS,
reviewed and-signed off by all parties in mid June. But despite repeated
requests, PDA have not yet raised a Change Request against which the CP
can be agreed to enable Pathway to move to the new baseline.

Dave H and Tony H have reviewed the Release 2 Benefit Payment System
designs at length in terms of the requirements:statement and to form a
basis for testing. Aréas of uncertainty include EVP on various transactions,
contingency operations via the Help Desk and contingency during total
failure of CAPS. Comments on.the BES High Level Design were also
produced.

Design reviews of the solution for non-ISDN connected outlets were
supported and.additional information from the workload brief prepared
and supplied.

° Dave H and Tony H-supported the design review to resolve-issues with the
Oracle Recall and Reissue Payments (RRP) process. Apart from.some
immediate fixes which will clear a.large number of outstanding PinICLs
and prevent their reoccurrence, the design is unable to cope with the
anticipated volumes. Separating-cardholder details from the payment will
have a large, beneficial effect, but is-‘a-mnajor work item not currently
planned into Release 2.

e There has been no response from-POCL to our firm position on Quantum
APS.

e We will create a Service Definition for the chargeable.connection-service
for take-on of new APS clients.

e We are being pressed for a definitive Mobiles design proposal.

«  There.is pressure to provide connection to disaster sites for TIP-and
HAPS, to provide some form of connection forthe large A702 weighscale
and questioning of the methods used to measure the-rated sound output of
the counter printer.

2.2.1.4 CARS
e There is about two days of detailed'‘work outstanding to sort out the very
large set of Ongoing CARs

2.2.1.5 ACCEPTANCE

e —_ The-initial ideas on testing scripts for Release 2 Temporary Tokens were
discussed with T&I and various Clarifications provided.

e We have agreed to move all the Acceptance Specifications to a Release 1e
(sic) level in order to establish a baseline from which to move to the final
acceptance level.when that is agreed.

e The: EPOSS, Referenée Data, TIP; Audit and Reconciliation specifications
are on hold until Requirements can conclude its‘current. PinICL task. That
for POCL Infrastructure depends on Design producing technical
documentation and performance models.

2.2:1.6 NEW BUSINESS SUPPORT
° Dave C has progressed this area:

° The Business Requirements Definition (BRD) for SAP-ADS (Inventory
Management), targeted at Release 3, was revised by POCL. Our response
to this for a Logistics Feeder facility is with other parts of Pathway prior to
presentation to POCL during the week of 8/9.

e The National Savings BRD, targéted at Release 3, is at a similar stage.
Acceptance critéria and service levels are in negotiation with POCL.

. A simplified statement of requirement for EFTPOS, also targeted at
Release 3, was prepared as the basis for a new commercial proposal. This
has been broadly accepted by POCL.

2.3 OTHER TEAM ACTIVITIES

2.3.1 PA REVIEW

e Dave H presented an overview of the Pathway solution and dealt with
matters arising in the follow-up discussions. A second niceting with John
D wentinto more detail on end-eid business processes and information
flows between the three parties (Horizon, BA and. POCL), the co-
ordination. of the end-end design.and the approach to end-end testing.

2.3.2 INTERNATIONAL SALES BIDS

. We welcome to the Requirements team Brian Hauxwell who brings a
global view of post office requirements. He is compiling a comparative
requirements statement, particularly for those services which are not
required by POCL. :

° Dave H attended the joint:meeting with Hungary Post and POCL to
discuss details of the two distribution projects and their potential use of
SAP R/3. During:the second day presentations were made on the Pathway
solution, .security provisions, the use of Agents and potential to link to SAP
R/3.

° Brian H also supported the ICL.team in Copenhagen and is resolving the
issue of ICL Pathway presence at Post Expo in Hamburg.

e Dave H attended and chaired the Workflow Management Coalition
meeting in Boston. A joint submission to the Object Management Group
on workflow technology, including ICL as a co-submitter, was completed
for review by OMG in September.

. Dave C did some formal training on the run up to EMU.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

° None.

4 ISSUES

e The pre-emptive demands of the 1¢ PinICL work continues to hamper
Requirements normal activities, particularly Acceptance:

¢ The dependency on technical documentation being available for use
during the Acceptance sequence remains.

. The issue of. POCL seeking conventional EPOS while the Pathway system
is concentrating on delivering for DSS remains. The requested design
paper discussing integration of GlobalStoe or similar with Riposte NT is

not a priority task for Peter Wiles. We cannot afford not to respond
sensibly to this.

1 MONTHLY SUMMARY

1.1 OPERATIONS

1.1.1 RELEASE 1A (IGL-2)

There were few problems with the operational running of IGL. The-service
continues to-run successfully:

Note that 23 September will be the first.anniversary of the implementation
of the first Post Office.

1.1.2 RELEASE 1B

Release 1b continues to run with relatively few problems.

Call volumes to the Horizon.Systems.Helpdesk are-significantly down
from the July numbers.

A patch is to be applied which will avoid the effects of the memory leakage
problem. This will-effectively be a ‘work-around’ which forces the counter
system to re-boot each night. The problem is resolved in Release 1c.

1.1.3 RELEASE 1c

Pat Lywood has been appointed Model Office Manager and will assume
full responsibility for the planning ,control and co-ordination of Model
Office activities across Pathway with effect from MOT. This isa _
permanent role in addition to Pat's other:duties as Operations Test &
Integration Manager, and will be carried forward into-all future rélease
programmes. Pat will assist Gill Jackson during MOR2.

Martin Molloy has been appointed Model:Office Site Manager (for
Pathway) and will be located on-site full time at Borough Road during
Model Office activities. He will be responsible for maintaining an effective
and continuous liaison between the PDA and Pathway during MOR and
MOT. Martin will be supported by Jeremy Lindegaard-Stewart. Martin
and Jeremy contifue in their roles as Service Managers for POCL and BA
services respectively.

Terms. of reference are. being: prepared for sign-off by both Pathway and
the PDA. A support notice documenting these-roles will be published

© The migration plan has now been base-lined but depends on access:to the
10 IGL Post Offices over the migration weekend. Although there are
verbal assurances we are still awaiting something in writing.

1.2 BA & POCL SERVICES

e — Performance.against a number of SLAs is now being monitored and has
been reviewed with the PDA. The PDA were very appreciative of the initial
statistics pack that was prepared by Peter Robinson.

e  There-are no SLA performance issues.

e DLR. have the definition of the IGL Card Migration PUNs and are to
provide proofs.

@ —RML have signed-off the Pathway specification for Track and Trace’ file
format.

© The PDA have agreed the manual process for DSS/POCL caller
identification for R1C.

e@ It has been.agreed that the Payment Card Helpline will not need to offer a
Welsh service nor dual-site operation until Release 2.

1.3 CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

e A presentation of our plans for the Manager Care Visit Programme:and on
the operation of the Service Visit Reply Cards process was made to the
POCL Regional Liaison Managers.

e An article on the operation of the.Service Visit Reply Card process’ has
been delivered to the PDA for publication to Horizon users.

e@ The nuniber of returned reply cards,as a percentage of visits has increased
back up to over 50%. The general lével of satisfaction with service'visits
remains high but 2 cards returned from Model Office expressed concern
over the elements of the service provided by the Horizon System
Helpdesk. We will be progressing these concerns with Model Office staff
and with the Horizon System Helpdesk management.

1.4 RELEASE MANAGEMENT

11.4.1 RELEASE AUTHORISATION AND DISTRIBUTION (RAAD)

e A total of 9 fixes have now been distributed, 4 to counters and 5 to the

The road:shows conducted by Denise Ivetmee-and. Alison Peacock were
well attended and well received by all our suppliers. The Pathway event
was not well attended and I propose to run extra events for Pathway to
ensure that this important process is well.understood by-all.

1.5 SYSTEM SUPPORT

I have agreed with-Personnel an-appropriate out-of-hours-and shift policy
for the System Support Centre.

Recruitment of new staff continues but is slow - matters should. improve
once the relocation to Bracknell is underway.

The “Memory Loss” problems on counters has been located in Riposte.
Tests indicate that the problem is source cleared in Release 1c.

1.6 SYSTEMS OPERATE / MANAGEMENT

CFM was closely focused on the support and operation of MOR-2 and on
security testing, particularly in the area of TELNET access. There has been
substantial activity in this area with site visits to Wigan and Belfast
followed by the running of the Bracknell test scripts, the results of which
we are awaiting.

In summary good ‘progress, with the Service Management Centre now
operational and software distribution now proven on Release 1b.

Event activation has been tested satisfactorily on, BIT-and will be.activated
for MOR2. No major issues outstanding on the product other than
bedding in the support routes.

1.7 RESILIENCE AND RECOVERY

This was reviewed during August and number of.actions putin place. A
summary of these are as follows:

CFM providing PAS/CMS back-up scripts to Development
for incorporation into €M and maestro

Change made to maestro schedule to change-sequence of
events after hot back-up

Graham Lloyd has submitted a CP to introduce Oracle
close:down and restart after a hot back-up

testing required to prove recovery. onto EMC discs
Oracle procedures required for cold back-up

BMC patrol. Knowledge Module required for failure during
tape copying

Harvey Potts has produced a paper outlining the design elements but the
operational aspects of this are still a major cause for concern.

Martin Riddell is leading on ‘the production of an overall CS Strategy for
managing R&R involving CFM, Sequent. and Oracle.

1.8 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SERVICES

1.8.1 SERVICE LEVEL MANAGEMENT

The’Service Performance Review Book was populated with live data in
time for the Service. Management Review Forum-meeting on 21 August
and was very well received,

Draft SLAs were constructed for DNS and presénted at the POCL/DNS
SLA Forum. They were well received as a first pass activity and are being
taken forward to be reviewed internally within DNS before further
progress in September.

1.8:2 WORKLOAD VOLUMETRICS

Volumetrics (version 13) is being reviewed against'the roll-out plan which
will be issued in the first; week of September before delivery to ICL Sorbus.

1.8.3 RECONCILIATION

Good progress on the reconciliation reporting and error resolution
processes have ‘now been signed off by Pathway and the PDA.

Bob Davis drafted the scope for part 2 and gained agreement by the PDA
led Benefit Payments Panel. The perceived success of part 1 provided an
opening for a leading role in part 2, which includes topics that have-to
date been excluded by: the PDA from the joint. Pathway, DSS-and POCL
process definition work.

Transaction volumes for OBCS have now exceeded 800,000 since Release
1b commenced in early May BUT we have now reason to believe that
some of the supplied is incorrect. Figures from the PDA show
inconsistencies when compared against the volumes supplied by Pathway
and the ‘POTH’ volumes obtained internally within BA.

Richard Brunskill has escalated the problem for resolution and also
implemented a software function that scans the database for duplicates.

1.9 PROCESS MANAGEMENT

1.9.1 BPS PROCESSES

° Incorporation of Mail-sort CBC (bar-coded mail sorting) into the
distribution, process is-moving slowly as RML have so far not provided
sufficient information. There-may be a reluctance by RML to accept
Pathway’s rejection of Mail-sort 1 as the solution for PUN distribution,
particularly since they stand to lose significant business volumes once the
transition to Payment Cards is ‘underway. Tangible evidence of successful
address cleansing by the DSS is to be pursued.

e Dave Law attended a POCL contract meeting with Paul Curley and
presented the latest version of the card batch receipt, reconciliation and
issue process: The major issue still to be resolved is the potential conflict
of interest between RML and POCL on SLAs ‘and liability for card batches
at the batch delivery point. RML and POCL are to meet in private with the
intention to escalate this issue to Post Office corporate level for a final
decision.

e Jan Ambrose has reached agreement with the PDA on the baseline for.
measuring EPOSS transactions, the principle of equivalent transactions and
the use of keyboard/touch screen.

e — A proposal. for the benchmark process for National Savings products has
been produced and a meeting held with POCL to discuss processes and the
way forward.

2 PROGRESS

All level 1 and Management handshakes are being reviewed and will be included
in the next.monthly report:

4 ISSUE

4.1 MIS DEVELOPMENT

Peter'spent 3 days:in workshop mode at CFM Dublin reviewing the Design
to Requirements documents for MIS and. Data Warehouse. They were
reviewed against the draft Schedules Version 7.0; the following disturbing
points:arose:

actions to be progressed before sign-off can be achieved
schedules not reflect fully in the Release 2 solution

areas.of change that have been applied that will make the
delivered solution different to that of Requirements

remedies cannot be identified before the first week after the
Quarter to which: they apply and, then ONLY atthe
BA/POCL level

there is no means of identifying remedies against either
Suppliers or Services.

Actions will be progressed as a matter of urgency and revised schedules
raised for submission to the PDA for change proposals.

4.2 RELEASE 1C IMPLEMENTATION

The RRP failures.in Model office and the subsequent decision by PDA to
rerun MOR2 is-a'major disappointment. As a-result, the likely scenario is
that the plan will shift 3 weeks to the right. The obvious.impact is on ‘the
Congo 4.1 upgrade on 1 -2 November and subsequent PDR load. I
understand the CAPS viewpoint to be that it would like 2-3 weeks between
Release 1c and Congo.4.1. This would.mean Congo 4.1 would be delayed
by 2 weeks. I believe development is looking to save a week from
MOR/MOT which may reduce this time to 1 week. I have also heard. that
CAPS.do not want.to push back Congo 4.1. This would mean 1 - 2 Nov
would be a ‘big bang’ weekend with both activities. This is.a high risk
proposal which has nothing to recommend it from an operations
implementation viewpoint:

Quality &-Risk Report

1 MONTHLY SUMMARY

« FRM progress. Good progress has been made on FRM processes. We are
now in a reasonable:state of readiness for Release 1c. However PDA are
not able to receive and analyse fraud data, due to a reluctance to approve
spending on workstations with Business Objects. Release 2 work
progresses well, with the production of reference data for joint.testing of
the FRM Database in September.

« — Risk:Management. Considerable effort in this area during August;
including a National Roll Out Risk Review for the PA programme review,
and the start of Release 2 analysis.

e System Security. Release 1c exclusions have been agreed with PDA, subject
to a. number of caveats. The most onerous of these is providing a
commitment that-all remaining security functionality is in Release 2. This
requires speedy work-with Escher and in determining the potential for use
of NT extensions. Considerable effort is also being put into testing and
clearance of PinICL’s. This has been at the expense of Release, 2 activities.

© = Quality. Subcontractor Quality Plans-and reviews continue. Quality
Assurance of documentation progress continues.

° Process‘Management. Slow progress is being made on Operational Change
Management and. End-2-End New Business processes. This is mainly due
to slow and unnecessarily detailed response from PDA.

e Audit. A Release 1c User Manual is being developed, and a workstation
being set up with the required tools.

e Year 2000 Conformance. Progress. has been made in obtaining
commitment from suppliers to provide conformance.

e Issues:

Potential security exclusions for Release 2 need to be
identified rapidly, in order to finalise negotiation and
acceptance of Release 1c:

Focus on Release 1c has been at the expense of work for
Release.2. This needs to be addressed during September
(particularly in Security and Audit).

2 PROGRESS

All level 1 and Management handshakes are being reviewed and will be included
in the next monthly report.

2.1 FRAUD RISK MANAGEMENT

Review of FRM Release strategy. Confirmation is now required:PDA that
the equipment to be used for FRM report receipt by the PDA will be
funded by the Contracting Authorities. This has still not been:received.

Internal FRM procedures:

Internal Investigation Procedure. Review comments from
Pathway have been incorporated. The document requires
final review to ensure that correct procedures are included
for the production of company secret documents.

Investigation of Reconciliation Fraud Procedure. This will
be completed jointly with Girobank.

Fraud Case Database (Release 2). The production of reference data has
started in order to start joint testing with PDA by end of September.

Fraud Liability Apportionment. No progress.

Procedures for impounded cards, PUN’s and Temporary Tokens. Final
reviews Have'taken place with the PDA; only one commercial issue is
outstanding. Costing of card,examinations from PDA is-awaited. The
outline procedure has been produced.

Fraud Incentive Reward Scheme. No progress.

FRM Pathway/PDA actions. A matrix of actions required to produce an
end to end operation has been produced for discussion with PDA.

2.2 RISK MANAGEMENT

A National Roll out Risk Review was cartied out as input-to the PA
Consultancy programme review. It identified risks.in $ areas:

General; end to end programme status, internal
communication to Sponsors, system dependencies on
BA/POCL, PFI/supplier contract.

PDA responsibility; Release 2 RCD not agreed, contractual

acceptance specifications and process, EVP implementation

timing, speed of response to change requests, revised testing
approach required. :

from a review of the Release 2 plan. A change to the Risk Management
Process is being proposed to make it a more active part of programme
planning and progress monitoring.

e — An Excel Pivot table has been produced for the analysis of PinICL’s
associated with Release 2 risks.

2.3 SYSTEM SECURITY

2.3.1 RELEASE DEFINITION AND NEGOTIATION

© Most of August has been.consumed in addressing the shortcomings in
Release 1c security functionality and auditing. Following discussions with
the PDA Fraud & Security Group, mitigations have been developed for
each missing element, and supporting processes and documentation
defined. Agreement has been reached on all identified exclusions; however
not without PDA insisting on additional ‘hoops to jump through’. The
most onerous of these:is the requirement to provide the remaining security
functionality at Release 2. This will require speedy agreement and work by
Escher.

. To satisfy ‘an additional Sponsor requirement, a strategy has been designed
to ‘guarantee’ a clean and secure migration from R1c to R2. This involves
building the Bootle configuration from the same build scripts as those used
for Wigan, but in isolation; migrating the production data from Wigan to
Bootle and rebuilding Wigan from the original scripts.

¢ To ensure the integrity of systems at the counter it is proposed to run a
Tivoli ‘Bill of Materials’ check:on each workstation. Basically, the software
that is present on each counter position is compared against a list of
expected software. Any anomalies will bé investigated and may require
system swap-out.

. It is envisaged chat the Bill-of-Materials check will be utilised throughout
the life of the project on both as a scheduled task and on an ad hoc basis.

2.3.2 DOCUMENTATION

° Security Functional Specification Version 2.4 of the SES-has been sent to
the PDA for formal review.

¢ — Access Control Policy. Work continues to revise the ACP in the light of
changed system solutions.

‘e —_ All three anti-virus documents have been signed off. The Pathway
computer virus policy has also been signéd off.

e Work on the Pathway Security Standards is progressing well.

2.3.3 CRYPTOGRAPHY

e The design for the online Key Management Service (KMS) for Release 2 is
being progressed with TSC (Bracknell).

2.3.4 SECURITY MANAGEMENT

° Progress on site’security at Bootle and Wigan.has been made; completion
is expected by 15/9/97 and site audits with PDA are being arrangéd for
week beginning 22/9/97. A site audit of Belfast is planned for the previous
week.

e TSC have'been progressing the:Security Event Management solutions for
1c.and Release 2. The results of their work'will be presented on 8"
September. The Release 1¢ work will be used as one input to the Audit
workstation development.

e A security audit of De La Rue card production’ at Tewkesbury has been
conducted. This concluded that the overall level of security;was.in excess
of requirements. 3 actions were identified, the most important of which is
the construction of a wall to isolate the card production area.

2.3.5 SECURITY SOLUTION

e The initial drop of the COSManager product was demonstrated. Certain
shortcomings are evident around the level.of auditing and the degree to
which Sequent have configured the product.

e A. meting took place with Security Dynamics, CFM and Sequent to
progress the.requirement for SecurID tokens for Release 2. Belinda
Fairthorne is producing a requirements definition document for handover
to Design.

¢ A solution.to the risk-of wrongdoers spoofing the PAS/CMS Help Desk is
being sought with the PDA Fraud & Security Group.

e The firewalls identified in the Network Security Report.are being
configured but this work is being hampered by issues around IP address
allocation.

3.1 PROCESS MANAGEMENT

Process Audits (D/I/T). The Development Audit Improvement Plan has
been updatéd with progress and completion dates planned at 1/8.

Requirements and Contract Schedules related to Test Audit Records have
been reviewed and summarised for Test Management.. Recommendation
made that-the:final audit run.of‘each.test should be-completed.end-to-end
without changes once the.tést has commenced.

Operational Change Management. Workshops have been planned for early
September to analyse and decompose the 3 main categories of change
identified in the Catalogue, namely Outlet, AP Client:and Product. The

‘meni hierarchy issue has been resolved to the extent that a workshop was
-held where Pathway assumed design responsibility as opposed to relying

on. POCL/PDA to arrive at their desired position. Another issue regarding
thé tagging of reference-data to change.requests has arisen. A proposal to
POGL/PDA has been made bit they are rejecting ‘it for Release 2. We
believe that the proposal is achievable for R2 but that POCL would not be
able to service it anyway.

End-2-End New Business. A.PDA facilitated review workshop has taken
place. A-number of relatively minor changes emerged which have been fed
into updated versions of the process and the BRD PD. These have been fed
to the.PDA. Comments (mostly minor) being incorporated but PDA has
been told that Pathway is content with both documents and we seem now
to be waiting on POCL/BA/PDA to reach.agreement among themselves.

3.2 AUDIT

The definition of general audit to be provided at Release 1c has made
considerable progress. A Release 1¢ User Manual is being produced.

The release Proposal for Auditing at Release 1c (effectively an audit
design) has been produced arid baselined. A workstation is being set up
with the required tools ‘to test and demonstrate to PDA.

3.4 YEAR 2000 CONFORMANCE

e Considerable progress has been made with. negotiating revised.contracts to

examining the effects of Year 2000 on its products, and a commitment to
produce a policy statement by the end of September.

° No conformance:status has‘ yet.been received from Tivoli, HP Open View,
PCMS or Cheyenne Arc Server.

4 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

© — Security exclusions for Releasé 1c have been agreed subject'to'a number of
mitigations and caveats. Thé most onerous is the.requirement to provide
full functionality for Release 2. The:main issues are concerning access
control at the Counters (Riposte).

© Release 2 has.suffered as a result of the focus on Release 1c. It is now
urgent that-we plan design and development;, particularly in the Security
and Audit areas.

e Testing at Bracknell continues to raise issues, mainly related to the
management of the function. and reporting of results. A considerable
amount of éffort, by both Development and QRM is taken up with
reviewing progress.

e@ — QRM is once-again being overwhelmed with ‘short term’ issues’ which are
consuming resource at the expense of longer term activities. The workload
of Risk Management is increasing to accommodate higher demand for risk
analysis. The security team has been heavily involved in the definition of
exclusions, débate with PDA, and control of testing and PinICL’s.

5 ISSUES

° Tt is now urgent that resolution of the Business Objects and PC funding for
the PDA Ric is resolved and action taken.

6 COSTS

¢ — No relevant information is currently available in sufficient detail to report
on costs against budget for May.

Business Development Report

1 SUMMARY

1.1 GENERAL:

1.1.1 CUSTOMER EDUCATION

Progress continues to be painfully slow: We submitted a response to the
Benefit migration change request and raised a change control notice on
branding, the result of which has been to sit down and re-assess the
detailed requirements and then to scale down wherever possible, especially
where there is a cost impact on BA. The CCN’s will now be re-issued as a
single document:

Alertness to any negative media or political-comment‘is maintained,
especially sensitive during the period of'the independent
review/forthcoming report:

The position of no proactive communication of ICL Pathway is
maintained. However, the time has come where I believe we need to
cultivate friends in the political domain. To that extent, we are having
discussions with George Hall and John Cheetham to put a programme in
place asap to ensure that politicians know our side. of the story.

We have also undertaken a deliberate approach to demonstrating the
system to as many-relevant groups as possible. In the last month, we have
demoed to PDA Board, POCL Regional General Managers, representatives
from the commercial arm of BA. The reaction has’ been universally
positive. We now continue to identify other key groups who need to be
brought up to date with the system.

1.1.2 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT:

National Savings Phase I, SAP/ADS (Inventory Management) and EFTPOS
(acceptance of debit cards) are still on target'for Release 3, although
EFTPOS has a large amount of red tape to get through within the
timescales of Release 3 cut-off. It is important that despite the programme
delays we try to maintain the delivery dates for these services. This will
certainly require a parallel stream of development with a later cut-in to a
release. Mike Coombs is considering.

The new joint approach to Mails is continuing.

We continue to talk-to Girobank with regard to development of a banking
function on the Horizon system.

. We are looking at néw initiatives in the Bill Payment market. This is to
counteract loss of client business. Scottish Power have recently ended their
contract with Counters for Powercards. This business represents 13million
transactions'p.a. The loss of this business came:as,a:major surprise not only
to us but also to senior POCL people.

e There is.a half day workshop planned for 3“ October between POCL and
ICL Retail’s Precision Retailing people. This is to assess whether there is
possible consultancy business with POCL.

e Government Direct discussions continue.but not to any great success. The
challenge is still to identify a commercial driver for delivery of
Government information. .

e We continue involvement in the CFM led response to National Savings
OJEC to outsource:a major part of their business.

1.1.3 MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE

° Continued good work has been going on with the Regions in moving
forward the Red/Amber/Green surveys. This will help to ensure that alot
of the barriers to a smooth.implementation programme are removed in a
timely fashion. This is now on temporary hold until the appointment of
the National Implementation Manager which I am assured is imminent but
it has-been since early July!

e We continue work with the Change Management:people within POCL.
Festine lente appears to be the order of the day, at least until the NIM is in
place.

e Dave Miller has been seconded to Head-Office for six montlis to lead a
business strategy review. Tim Thorpe has taken his place in South West
region.

1.1.4 IMPLEMENTATION

e Continued work with.our implementation team.and PDA and POCL to
bottom out the commercial impact of approaches’to Training, Migration
and roll-out. Progress being made.

2 PROGRESS

All level 1 and Management handshakes are being reviewed and will be included
in the next monthly report.

2.1 MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS

2.1.1 CUSTOMER EDUCATION

e Agreement in principle to the over-all strategy for communicating the roll-
out of the payment card in 1998 remains. No further movement on
agreement of the budgetary issues: on receipt of this agreement tactical
communication planning can commence. It now lies with us to resubmit
the response to change request L054 now we have established their exact
requirement.

° The PDA have stated, contrary to earlier statements, that no proactive,
benefit-milestone-driven, communication activities are required.

e The agreement reached in August 1996 was for no TV advertising. The
most recent proposals reverse this and suggest TV advertising. The use of
TV has PDA, but not ministerial endorsement.

e If we are to produce a TV advertisement for airing at the commencement
of national roll-out in summer 1998, the process of production within an
environment where 15 organisations will need to give approval, will be
necessarily complex. The production of an advertisement brief (something
that will also have to be approved by the 15 organisations) should start
shortly.

e The PDA have been informed that if a creative/storyboard is required for
ministerial submission in November, the brief process should start now:
however, to start, ICL Pathway must be indemnified from any costs -
should TV not be approved. The PDA response to this point is awaited,

e The issue of who has the responsibility for informing customers of
subsequent benefit migration, is still outstanding. We will raise a CAR on
this matter.

e The branding CCN (174a) is to be withdrawn; we will accommodate their
branding requests by reallocating funds from items not required and
without accepting a formal branding liability: PDA agreement on this
point is still awaited.

. Senior sponsor irivolvement and understanding of the implication.of this
project, is lamentably low. We are informed that the BA areé giving the
introduction of the card a very low-profile - they see it as the least
important of eight major change programmes. They fail to understand that
the card introduction, and more importantly some of the associated
changed processes, may cause public consternation and that this
consternation may Undermine the communication of their other change
programmes. MPs especially, (this administration is committed to “the
mai in the street’s view”) if they knew, would be uncomfortable with this
approach. This position may be causing the BA to undervalue thé customer
education communication task and to want to play down communication
(that is carry out.less-integrated communications and use media which is
less intruisive.i.e-othér than TV). Efforts are underway to persuade, at the
very least, senior managers:who have the communication remit, that this
project must not be.treated lightly. This task is made more difficult by the
erratic way in which the.PDA convene meetings of the senior,
Communications Steering Committee.

e — The PC1 leaflet which.accompanies the PUN letter has been signed off by
the PDA. The Leaflet.is now being produced in 11 languages in print and
audio form. Braille, audio, computer disc and large print versions will not
be produced until the issue of War Pensions branding is resolved. Print rian
quantities have.been based on the quantities required until the end of Jine
in 1998.

e¢ The PDA have endorsed our proposals for the distribution of leaflets and
posters to all post offices, BA and ES offices, as those office are
implemented. Necessary sub-contracts have been established.

e Negotiations have béen.concluded with Financial Dynamics (our PR
agency) to vary the.established contract, by halving fees until national roll-
out commences. Negotiations are also underway to vary the MRM(our
fulfilment service. sub-contractor) minimum-fee.

e Anna Campopiano met with Rob Durrant the communications:director of
POCL. The meeting ‘illustrated that POCL see automation as having the
profound ability to-effect'their reputation both positively and negatively.
More worrying was the director’s lack of comprehension that with a
network of this size, a very.small élement may always be down. It was
pointed out that such failures do not constitute a crisis, but do require
skilful handling. The meeting had two main actions. Rob agreed that
meetings between the regional media teams of BA and POCL
representatives should be arranged. The objective would be to “workshop”
various issues and to provide the (less well informed) regional teams with
solutions for issues which could be exploited by the media: a paper'on this
subject has been written and is with the PDA for comment. The other
action was to show Rob ICL’s approach to intranet/knowledge
management - a meeting with Liz Lank has been arranged for 8 September.

. Spreadsheet for 1997 and early 1998 budget activity is finalised.

e There will be no advertising, other than posters in implemented offices, in
1997.

2.1.2 SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS

° Planning for the communication activity for the 200 offices to go live in
October, is continuing: this will involve briefing events for the special
interest groups - one event in the NE and one event in the SW. Actions _
will not be confirmed until formal PDA agreement to the. programme roll-
out schedule.

e The design of the briefing stands and newsletter are approved.

° We arc in discussion with the PDA .and the COI about using the Benefits
Agency publication “Touchbase” as the vehicle to distribute a newsletter
on the Payment Card. This‘approach.is very cost’effective for us and
additionally achieves excellent control information to over 98,000 special
interest group representatives, on a regular basis. BA have a number of
reservations - not least their desire to underplay card communication in
favour of other change programmes, and therefore.to not.forewarn special
interest groups in a systematic way, of the impact of the:card introduction.

2.1.3 PRESS PLANNING

e Alertness to ariy'‘negative media or political comment is maintained, and
there is an éspecial sensitivity during the period of the independent
review/forthcoming report.

e The PDA are not resourced to deal with any significant media or political
‘interest. Processes exist:within ICL Pathway to manage such.an issue:but it
‘should be accepted that the BA will feel that they should take the lead -
regardless of what POCL feel: any situation will be less than clean.

e A media briefing will be held.in.the NE and the SW in early October: the
briefing will:be aimed at:regional media only. No further planning can
take place until the earliest card issue dates are confirmed. At present there
is no indication of any ministerial involvement in the regional media
briefing. No activity with the Trade or Quality national press is planned
until 1998.

2.1.4 MISCELLANEOUS & INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS

* With no clear guidance on.roll-out dates PDA are saying nothing to
internal audiences of either the BA &:POCL. PDA driven, internal
communication is therefore, in a state of drift, which will not be arrested
until clear dates are set.

° This month has seen activity to persuade the BA-of our necessary
involvement:in their internal communications.

ICL Pathway internal communications, this month saw the issue of the
presentation “this is ICL Pathway” and the communication of the internal
demo days.

The position on.no proactive communication of ICL Pathway is
maintained.

2.2 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

2.2.4 EFTPOS (DEBIT CARD ACCEPTANCE)

Our most recent commercial proposal’ has been favourably received, and
we will receive formal feedback once the key: POCL player returns ‘from
annual leave. The.current proposal is for a minimum functionality
EFTPOS service-which can be enhanced in the future as required. POCL
are taking the EFTPOS business case to their authorisation committee
(COMPEC) at the start of October, and we are preparing ourselves for an
intense period between then and the end of October when we will have a
large amount of red tape to get through and a significant group of
signatures to collect in order to ensure inclusion in Release 3. We are
currently planning the pre-work which can be done before authorisation is
received.

2.2.2 SAPADS (INVENTORY MANAGEMENT)

We have proposed three commercial options to POCL, two of which (the
more expensive options) were well received. POCL are currently deciding
which option. they wish to take. They are. asking us to review the
functionality and service levels to see if there is any opportunity ‘for us to
reduce our costs {and price), and we will respond to this in the first half:of
September. Plans are now in place charting the activities which need to be
completed to ensure inclusion in Release-3, and we-are progressing well
against them. We still have.a concern over POCL’s user awareness.and
training proposals, and our Management of Change team will be reviewing
them with POCL’s project:manager on 8 September, prior to submitting
our own proposal.

2.2.3 NATIONAL SAVINGS

POCL have accepted our proposals on.SLAs in principal, and work is
underway to formalise this within the next month. We have responded to
POCL’s initial roll-out critéria and are awaiting a revised set taking
account of.the points we raised.. The roll-out criteria and SLA proposals
will be referred to in the letters of intent, and accordingly must be
completed prior to receiving authorisation of the letters of intent. We are
still looking to include this in release 3.

2.2.4 GENERIC BANKING

As mentioned last month, Alliance 8& Leicester are putting.a lot of.effort
into creating a set of service requirements. Their main concern is that we
will not be able to deliver their requirements early enough whereby they
can.avoid Year 2000 work. Further analysis'is required to understand the
exact nature of this problem. We have been-allowed no involvement with
this client in the last‘ month, an issue which has been raised at some length
with the relevant people in POCL. If requirements are not forthcoming in
the next'month, then I will escalate within POCL - we:are still keen to
deliver this as part of release 4 to avoid A&L’s Year 2000 issues.

2.2.5 MAILS

Terms of reference have been,agreed for the joint POCL, Royal -Mail, ICL
Pathway team to examine the-savings, improvements in customer service,
and additional sales which a re-engineered mails product could deliver. It

is. likely that any resultant requirements will not need to be delivered until *

the end of 1* quarter 1999 at the earliest.

2.2.6 MARKETING SUITE.

11 events have been held in the. Marketing Suite this month, including 2
Client Launch Days and a series of ‘Progress and Good News’
presentations to POCL’s Regional Géneral Managers, the Programme
Delivery Authority Board, and the BA’s finance team: The number of
events have dropped by 10 since.last month as business development
resource from both POCL and ICL Pathway focuses on achieving the

. timescales for rélease 3 cut-off.

2.2.7 NEW BUSINESS PLANNING

Household budgeting has passed its business feasibility within POCL. It
has now been formally handed over to Financial Markets Business Centre
to create a proposal which is acceptable:to both the utilities and the BA.

2.3 MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE

2.3.1 EVENTS

21 Management Awareness events have been completed. Only one for
South Wales remains.

A number of other Federation based events-are being organised. Our
policy remains that we resist these events’unless there is a pressing case to
be present as we have found that they can cause conflict with User
Awareness Events.

Peter Burden and Steve Cowburn were invited to Chesterfield for a tour
of their paper handling factory. This is part of the initiative to build
bridges with Chesterfield who have requested a Pathway Liaison manager
to'match their Automation Liaison Manager. There are further visits of
Chesterfield staff.to Feltham on 7/10/97 and Pathway staff to Chesterfield
on 12/9/97 planned.

2.3.2 POCL ORGANISATION & STRATEGY

The appointment for the National Implementation Manager has been
delayed. I am informed that the likely candidate is not from.POCL,
however, is an employee of the Post Office Group originally from
ROMEC. The appointments of the Regional Implementation Managers
will begin with an advert , however, appointments will only be confirmed
by the NIM once in.place. It is therefore unlikely that‘the NIM.and RIMs
will be in place before the end of October.

These moves will coincide the the move of the PDA implementation team
back into POCL.

The reporting structure will show the RIMs reporting into their Regional
General Manager but with a strong dotted.line to the NIM. The.NIM and
the RGMs will report to Jonathon Evans. Mena.Rego and.Paul Rich
remain responsible fot thé business case and will work with the NIM and
Jonathon Evans in a matrix:structure.

The French Thornton team are changing their areas of responsibility. Min
Burdett has largely finished her work to put in place a technical migration
strategy. Chris Robinson has been asked to design an organisational
blueprint which will allow POCL to implement its:range of change
programmes in an integrated manner !! Tim O’Leary is working with the
PDA move back into. POCL.

2.3.3 SATISFACTION FORUM

The results from the POCL Research Services study have now been
distributed to regional staff. All actions have been: picked up and are being
managed. The FORUM is effectively managing the-various streams of
measurement activity and reporting on User Satisfaction.

2.3.4 PATHWAY LIAISON MANAGERS

All Red/Amber/Green work is currently on hold pending work by POCL to
standardise the process across all regions. This is being done in
conjunction with discussions about access to the rollout database and
information flows between Pathway, PDA and the regions. Once the RAG
analysis has been agreed we will the RNMs to do a full analysis ofall Post
Offices and so begin the process of Regional User Satisfaction Strategies.
The appointment of the.NIM is seen as a delaying factor in this process.

Recruitment plans are still-on hold.

All the above points including the successful interworking between PLMs
and RLMs was presented to the RGMs in Feltham with no disagreement.

2.3.5 OTHER

Mena Rego will schedule the next Communications Workers Union
mecting in Feltham. This will give us an opportunity to demonstrate the
system and to meet the Executive Council.

Dominic Barton and Steve Cowburn will be meeting the project manager
for‘SAPADS to discuss the Management of Change implications.

The replan has led to the development of the Management Information
Briefing concept, which would allow for an awareness event before the

first phase of the programme starts and then a further awareness event

before training, ensuring that information is transferred in a controlled
manner at the correct points in time.

2.3.6 ISSUES

The NIM and RIM appointments are being delayed which is also delaying
a number of other decisions, as many people seem to be “waiting for the
NIM to be appointed”.

2.4 CLIENT MANAGEMENT

2.4.1 INTERNATIONAL SALES

Following the submission of the tender to Post & Telekom Austria on 31*
July, activity switched to Kuwait and Hungary. Information was provided
to our distributor in Kuwait who-was submitting the proposal.
ICL-Hungary and three customers: visited POCL and Feltham. This is
likely to result in bid activity in late September and October.

cards

Significant progress has been made on the Temporary Payment Card. The
layout of the text, including the Welsh variant, and the definition of the
security features to be included was agreed. The PDA, Robin O’Connor
and John Cummins, then visited De La’Rue Security Print at Peterborough
to review the full.colour proof. This went down extremely well.

The amendments to the colour workings was completed and reviewed with
Robin O’Connor at Peterborough on 2" September. He signed off the
Temporary Payment Card with respect to inks (DLR. unique),-colours and
layout. Some:small amendments to: punctuation to-ensure consistence
were identified and will.be corrected. The final proof of the bound books
should be available towards the end of September.

1 SUMMARY

. Our design study for Deutsche Post.AG was presented at Board level on
20" August and was well received. It seems.likely that they will select
Riposte as the basis of their next generation counter systems and will
require services from ICL Pathway and FJ/ICL.Germaniy. A decision is
expected by the end of September.

e Following a joint software bid we have worked with An Post/Escher and
ICL Denmark to develop and conduct a series of customised
demonstrations to Post Denmark, which went very well. Consequently
we have succeeded in beating NCR, our only rival, and Post.Denmark
have announced. their decision to adopt Riposte. They have now asked us
to put-proposals to them for integration and implementation services
during September-and will visit'Feltham on the 17".

e From 8 tenders submitted (most bidding Riposte) Post and Telekom
Austria have selected Riposte and decided to licence directly from An
Post/Escher. Atthe same time they issued.a further ITT for systems
integration and implementation.services to all pre-qualified suppliers,
including ICL Pathway. Bids are due in on 8" September aid.a decision is
expected by 12" September. From discussions with PTA I believe it is
more likely that we will be selected if we'team with SNI, which we have
offered to do.

e We have:submitted a tender to Kuwait Post, teaming with Diyar United. in
. Kuwait and ICL Egypt. Implementation is in.3 phases and the bid is just
for the first phase. However the pricing offered by An Post/Escher for
Riposte is not phased and this has made us expensive in a very price
sensitive market. I do not expect our bid to succeed.

° Hungary Post plan to come out to:tender for a first. phase. of counter
automation in September. They visited POCL (regarding SAP) and us:in
Feltham on 27-28 August and ‘were especially interested in the security
aspects of our system as theft by their own counters staff.is endemic. They
have invited us to go to Hungary and help them with business aspects of
the project:prior to issue of the ITT. Local relationships with. ICL Hungary
are good and we plan to work together on the bid with ICL Pathway
priming.

. Following his.highly successful implementation of counter systems for
Singapore Post, I am delighted that Tony Lavery has joined us as
International Projects Manager, reporting to me: Tony’s priority is to
work out how we will resource the delivery‘of international projects and
he will work closely with Mike Coombs on this activity.

° New proposals for-a.strategic way forward with Escher and An Post are
now being discussed with some optimism that this time an agreement will
be reached but-anything or nothing could still happen.

2 PROGRESS

e —- Theré are no handshake-miléstones-affected by international sales.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

° None.

4 ISSUE

° Although our approach to the above.joint opportunities'with Escher and
An Post has been agreed in principle we still have no commercial
agreements to support any of the proposals that we-are now making.
Consequently we are potentially exposing ourselves and other parts of ICL
and Fujitsu to commercial risk. I am therefore containing international
sales activities to progressing current opportunities until we-are clear on
what future arrangements we will get with Escher and An Post.

agency to offer stage:

° The benchmark is 13 weeks for a high level external campaign.

e The total delay in fulfilling this urgent need has been caused by the Group
Resourcing requirement to exhaust all internal leads before going external

1.2 GENERAL

° High levels of resourcing requirements means that recruitment continues
to dominate the functions activity. Daniel Osmer, Group Resourcing,
remains on secondment with us to provide the additional capability to
achieve demands

° During the month, the 1988 Resourcing plan has been constructed for
Group submission in September. This highlights circa 40 permanent
people to be recruited between now and mid 1998, emphasising the
strategic need for effective resourcing processes

° Sandra Houghton joins the team as Personnel Officer on 1% September and
brings some very useful skill and experience, particularly from her
previous role in Group Resourcing where she was responsible for young
entrant resourcing and development
