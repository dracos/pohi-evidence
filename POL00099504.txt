Mike

Further to our conversation on Friday about material on the mediation process becoming public on Tuesday — please
find attached, in confidence, examples of the materials that will be used on Tuesday;

1. Adraft of a press statement that would go out mid / late morning on Tuesday to journalists who have covered
the second sight review, There are still some potential last minute amends to this ~ I'll make sure you get the
final one in the morning. In the meantime, this draft for your information will give you the sense of it.

2. The mediation ‘pack’

3. Draft of a letter we'd send out to the specific MP’s who have been involved with cases alerting them to this
process. Sophie is arranging this on Tuesday and we'll ensure that you are aware of the list of the specific MP’s
to whom this note will have been sent.

Also copying in to Peter as i'm aware he has also been involved in the build up dialogue on this with, for example, Susan
Crichton.

James Arbuthnot and Alan Bates aware — with all embargoed before being sent out on Tuesday.
Thanks

Mike
