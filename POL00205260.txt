4. Communication - Key Messages Option 2 @

« We are committed to thoroughly investigating all cases that have been submitted to the scheme.

+ We are determined to be as transparent as possible and will provide applicants with a
comprehensive report of these investigations.

* We believe our approach is reasonable and fair, and balances the position of applicants with
wider public interest

* We have confidence in the Horizon system which process six million transactions every day.
* Applicants in the Scheme represent less than 0.3% of the 68,000 people using the system.

* The on-going investigations and previous reviews over the last two years have found no
evidence of systemic issues with the Horizon computer system

« We have recognised that improvements could be made to training and support in wider areas
and are implementing improvements

¢ We will provide a summary report when all investigations have been completed.

* It would be inappropriate to comment on individual cases as details have been provided in
confidence.

* independent assurance quoted if/when possible

. Communication Key Messages Option 3 @

As a responsible business the Post Office is committed to listening and learning from our people. That
is why we set up inquiry into Horizon computer system in 2012.

During that time no evidence of systemic issues with the system has emerged.

We have therefore decided to move to a new approach where Post Office will investigate all cases and
provide applicants with a comprehensive report. We will mediate in cases where appropriate.

We have full confidence in the Horizon system which process six million transactions every day.
Applicants in the Scheme represent less than 0.3% of the 68,000 people using the system.

Once we have investigated all cases we will provide a summary report and make any improvements
that can be made in-light of these findings

It would be inappropriate to comment on individual cases as details have been provided in confidence.

* independent assurance quoted if/when possible

4. Media assessment @

« The following assesses the likely levels of media interest in the issue should we
take decisive action over the coming weeks (either becoming more assertive or
moving to close the Scheme)

« Now to summer: Allegation of white wash by Post Office resulting in 1-2 days
media coverage (poss BBC, Computer Weekly as well as nationals such as
Mirror, Mail as well as regional print and broadcast) This will be driven by and
include quotes from JFSA, MPs and applicants.

* Over the summer: Potential for media coverage driven by any Fol placed by JFSA
on cost of the scheme.

* Summer — Christmas: Possible regional and national stories by those who
continue to follow the story e.g BBC and Computer Weekly and regionals

¢ Run up to election: Potential remains for follow up around any announcement on
digital/ITC developments though our judgement is that while the JFSA would
continue to seek to generate coverage, media interest in the issue would start to
fade, certainly at national level.

5. Stakeholder handling

POL00205260
POL00205260

®

the role of Second Sight following the
statements made in Parliament in July 2013,
and the associated risk of calls for a further
ministerial statement and BIS select
committee interest.

The prospect of adverse media coverage is a
further factor as well as:

Further issues include:

+ Value for money and related FOI requests
on spend

* Potential to play into general election
timing:

+ MPs with cases may become critical of
the Post Office

+ Issue having potential to detract from
positioning Post Office across
Government as a good partner.

Stakeholder Concerns Handling
Minister The Minister will have concerns in relation to I Many of the risks set out here apply

whatever decision is made on the
Scheme. Indeed it could be argued that
the potential for hostile coverage playing
out across the next 12 months, up to and
including the election in May 2015 is
significant.

Our proposed approach is to seek
opportunities to set out the position as
fully as possible to the minister, signalling
a preferred approach and associated
options, but with clarity that we need to
make changes to the Scheme.

We will develop a detailed
communications strategy (supported by
external advice) and ensure approach
where timing is carefully considered and
the Post Office “fronts up” messaging.

We would include within this detailed
assessment of MP-related factors.

7. Triage @

At the Board’s request we examined the impact of the Horizon definition on the cases
where we have received detailed case questionnaire responses (70 cases). We used
the definitions below::-

* Core Horizon: ghost transactions; power/telecoms issues; recovery process; lost
data; Horizon terminal/hardware failures; remote access to Horizon

* Branch operating issues: cash and stock remittances; synchronisation with client
systems; other hardware failures (eg. pinpad/lottery/etc); branch accounting practices;
ATMs; paystation;

¢ Support: training; NBSC / HSD support; lack of investigation team; lack of audit trail;
allocation of risk; access to Horizon data; proof of errors

¢ Other: NT payments / branch relocations / issues with previous SPMRs / anything
else

It is not possible to examine the full caseload as the quality of the initial applications is
very poor. Firm conclusions cannot be drawn until the claims are investigated — currently
25 cases.

7. Triage @

Results (based on applications only — not investigation findings):
30 of the 70 have raised core horizon issues

59 of the 70 have referenced branch operating issues (38 of these cases do not
mention core horizon issues).

67 of the 70 have raised support issues (only 2 cases relate to support issues
only).

20 cases are criminal.
38 refer to incidents that occurred prior to 2007

We also examined the history of the wider Horizon definition and found it has
been in use since 2012. Given this we do not recommend using this approach
to reduce the caseload facing the Scheme.
