1 Introduction.

This document is intended to be a working level document that establishes the working practices that
exist between ATOS, on behalf of POL, and Fujitsu. The document sets out the guidelines that
govern the working relationship at the interface between Fujitsu and ATOS in relation to problem
management. This agreement is owned on behalf of Fujitsu by Post Office Account Customer
Services. It defines the customer and supplier responsibilities that both ATOS, on behalf of POL, and
Fujitsu must undertake in order to support the delivery of problem management to POL.

2 Scope.

This document defines how ATOS, on behalf of POL, and Fujitsu will report and manage problems
that have an impact on the service provided to POL. The document covers problem notification,
acceptance, control and resolution. Also contained within this document are the escalation and
reviews surrounding problem management.

3 Change Control.

This interface agreement is a working level operations document and therefore will not become a
contract controlled document. It will however be subject to controlled change once it has become
definitive at version 1.0. After which, changes will be managed through formal document review
meetings and be subject to agreement by both parties. The signatories to this document will arbitrate
upon any disputes concerning subsequent changes to the document required by either party.

This document, nor anything contained within, has any contractual significance nor constitutes an
agreement or amendment to any of the Related Agreements between Fujitsu and POL.

The document will be reviewed on an annual basis.

4 Intent of This Agreement

The intent of the agreement is to define responsibilities and detail the interactions that must take
place, between Fujitsu and ATOS on behalf of POL to ensure the successful delivery of a seamless
problem management service to the Post Office retail network.

4.1 Definition

Problem - A Problem is an underlying cause of one or more incidents that may result in further
incidents.

A Problem potentially exists when a defect in the specification, design, production, implementation, or
use of any of the service components results in any aspect of the service not meeting expectations.

A Problem will be raised when the impact of the defect (e.g. the level and severity of the related
incidents) is substantial enough to warrant action to eradicate it.

A Problem will also be raised following a Major Incident to ensure that the actions identified in the
Major Incident Report are actioned to completeness.

A Problem will be closed when it has been mutually agreed that the underlying cause has been fixed
or removed. Root cause analysis will identify the underlying defect and full details will be recorded on
the Problem Management database.

Problem Management Interface
FUJITSU [SUBJECT \* MERGEFORMAT ]

A problem may be closed if ATOS, on behalf of POL, is satisfied that everything has been done to
minimise the effect of the problem therefore the impact is negligible.

A problem may be closed if only one solution is available but POL decides not to implement it and
agree to live with the problem.

Many problems will have knock-on impacts or effects beyond the organisation/domain in which they
occur. These are known as Cross Domain Problems.

Example of a Cross Domain Problem:

Problem: Due to a faulty POL AP-ADC script First Rate branch order files are failing transformation.

1. Potential issue reported, analysed by the POA support teams, and a problem identified.
2. The problem reported by POA Problem Management to ATOS Problem Management team.
3. Problem logged, allocated unique number and prioritised.
4. ATOS Problem Management refer the problem to ATOS Reference Data team for analysis
and resolution.
5. ATOS Problem Management team monitor and review the progress on problem resolution
and feedback at the weekly cross-domain problem record reviews.
6. ATOS Reference Data team carry out change control process.
7. Proposed solution formally approved by POL or ATOS on their behalf.
8. Solution Implemented by ATOS Reference Data Team.
9. FJ POA and ATOS Problem Management team monitor implementation of the revised AP-
ADC script.
10. Problem closed if the First Rate branch order file transformation failures are eliminated.
11. Records maintained for future reference.

5 Responsibilities.

5.1 Joint.

Each party is responsible for maintaining and updating their own problem databases.

When a new cross-domain problem is identified in either domain the party who identified the problem
is to submit a new Problem Record Template (See Appendix 1) to the other party, thereby ensuring a
consistent problem record exists in both domains.

Both parties will maintain a shared cross-domain Problem Management spreadsheet which is
independently updated on a weekly basis by both parties and reviewed on a weekly basis at a cross-
domain Problem Management review. This spreadsheet is to detail the problem record reference for
both domains.

Each party will nominate a problem manager for all cross-domain problems.

Each party will ensure their counterpart problem manager is appraised as appropriate of the current
situation/status of the problems.

Both parties will authorise Temporary Procedures/Authorised Temporary Procedures impacting on the
Post Office operating process for cross-domain problems.

Both parties will provide incident reference(s) from their respective service desk calls to the associated
cross-domain problems.

Each party will ensure their counterpart problem manager is notified if problem ownership changes
(i.e. if ownership changes from one FJ POA problem manager to another the original problem
manager must notify their counterpart problem manager and vice versa).

5.2 ATOS Specific Responsi ies.

ATOS Problem Management will own the weekly problem report spreadsheet, which should detail all
‘open’ problems, including those that it has been jointly agreed should be on ‘monitoring’.

POL will manage aspects of any problem relating to the operating process within the Post Office front
line e.g., office process & back end systems e.g. CFS, etc.

POL own management of any planned communication with the branches, e.g., Message Broadcast
Service.

5.3 Fujitsu POA Specific Responsibilities

Fujitsu Services POA will update and maintain individual problem records in their Problem
Management Database.

Fujitsu Services POA will manage any problems technical and physical originating in the Fujitsu
domain.

Fujitsu Services POA will undertake an annual review of problem records from the perspective of
identifying from those records any trends for which underlying cause corrective actions could be
implemented. E.g., Process improvements, additional test methodologies, etc.

6 Problem Notification

6.1 ATOS (POL) to Fujitsu Services

Any cross-domain problem arising from within Post Office Limited or Post Office Limited Third Party
supplier domains (excluding Fujitsu POA) will be registered with ATOS Problem Management and an
ATOS Problem Manager will be assigned to manage the problem.

All problems that are passed from ATOS into Fujitsu POA are documented on the Problem Record
Template. ATOS Problem Management will e-mail the completed template to the Major Account
Change team within Fujitsu Services at MAC@_

The Major Account Controllers are available between 0800 to 20.00 hours Monday to Friday and 0800
to 14.00 hours Saturday, excluding bank holidays.

The MAC Team are responsible for logging the new problem record in TfS and e-mailing the POA
Problem Management team with the Fujitsu problem record TfS reference so that a POA Problem
Manager can be assigned.

6.2 Fujitsu Services (POA) to ATOS (POL)

Any cross-domain problem arising from within the Fujitsu domain will be registered in the Fujitsu
Services TfS POA Problem Management database and a POA Problem Manager will be assigned.

The POA Problem Manager will complete the attached problem record template and e-mail it to the
MAC team requesting a new problem record is raised. The e-mail will also request that the MAC team
sends the template on to the ATOS Problem Manag im [ HYPERLINK
“mailto:postofficeproblemmanagement.it-solutions@ requesting that a corresponding
problem record is raised in the ATOS domain.

7 PROBLEM ACCEPTANCE

Once the problem has been registered and allocated to a Problem Manager in Fujitsu or ATOS the
Problem Manager in the notified domain will make contact with the Problem Manager in the originating
domain and agree acceptance.

Both Problem Managers will ensure that the problem title is the same on both databases, that the
reference numbers of both problems are registered on each database and that they both agree that a
problem exists.

The originating party should provide evidence to support the case such as incident numbers, impact
and extent of the problem and provide information on any temporary procedures that are in place.

Ownership of the problem (responsibility for resolution) will then be agreed. Both parties must agree
for the problem to be accepted. As part of the acceptance the Problem Managers will broker and
agree the problem priority, closure criteria, and a provisional target date. These of course may change
as the problem investigation develops.

When a new problem is accepted ATOS Problem Management will update the weekly problem report
spreadsheet to include the new cross-domain problem record.

If the problem is rejected at this stage the originating party may escalate the problem to senior service
managers who can discuss the issue with their opposite number and provide arbitration.

8 PROBLEM CONTROL

Management of any cross-domain problem will include the following stages:
e Analysis (to determine root cause)
e Control (TP or ATP implementation, escalation)

e Resolution (review and closure)

Analysis —

The relevant domain will carry out the analysis to determine the extent and impact of any specific
problem. It may also mean the implementation of “traps” to pick up any further occurrences before the
root cause can be established. Once the root cause has been established, a description and date
identified will be disseminated to the other business as an effective measure of the Problem Management
process. As the analysis progresses initial perceived root causes may change.

Incident Matching - Both domains will exchange volumes of incidents to associated problems to an
agreed timescale which would normally be on a weekly basis (dependant on the problem).

Control — This covers escalation of problems as necessary and the introduction of Temporary
Procedures (TP - exclusive to each domain but does not impact the other domain in conducting it's
business as usual) or Authorised Temporary Procedures (ATP - Agreed between each party). Audit trails
will also be maintained within each domain that enable tracking of actions or interaction between the two.
domains.

Resolution - Cross domain problems can only be closed when both domains agree that the closure
criterion has been met without compromising any other services

Both domains will provide a review of all problems to determine if the solution provided has actually
removed the problem. Closure may be after a monitoring period and will be agreed by both parties.

9 PROBLEM STATUS

The status of any problem will be maintained in one of the following conditions:

Open - A problem has been raised and an assessment of the problem is still underway or evidence is
being collected. An update schedule has been agreed and developed. A plan has been developed,
agreed and is in progress, this may include the development of diagnostic traps to provide further
evidence as required for investigation.

Monitor — The solution has been implemented and the problem is believed to be resolved, it has been
placed under monitor to see if the solution is effective.

Closed — All actions have been completed and the both parties agree that the closure criteria have been
satisfied. A problem will only be closed when it has been agreed that the underlying root cause has been
fixed or removed. This should be agreed between all impacted parties and the originator.

Note: The above statuses define the status fields of mutual interest to both parties. In order to manage
the progress of problems either party may wish to subdivide the statuses e.g., Open for the purposes of
monitoring progress may also include:

e Undergoing root cause analysis
e Root cause analysis complete but implementation not forecast

e Resolution allocated to release or implementation date forecast (these two are broadly
the same status but allows for implementation which is not connected to a specific
release and is therefore not dependent on a release date)

10 REVIEW MEETINGS

10.1 Problem Management Operational Review Forum

The Cross Domain Problem Management Forum is held on a weekly basis and discusses all problems on
the shared weekly problem report spreadsheet. The meeting is generally held at 11.30 on a Friday and
after discussing the open problem records any other business is covered. This may include incidents
which are having a cross-domain impact.

Atos Problem Management chair this meeting.

10.2 Post Problem Implementation Review Meeting (PPIR)
A PPIR is carried out if the Problem Manager from either domain or any impacted party was unhappy
with the way the problem was resolved or managed. This review may be held as a conference call.

The PPIR reviews the way the problem was handled and looks to highlight the areas that did not operate
well and require improvement, either within the operation of the process or the process itself.

The output of the PPIR is to initiate improvement actions to ensure that the process is operated as it
should be or ultimately improved.

APPIR should be held at an appropriate time after the fault has either been placed on monitor or as near
to the problem solution as possible.

The requesting Problem Manager chairs the PPIR. The attendees should include the major players within
the resolution of the problem being reviewed.

Details of the PPIR will be documented in the ‘closed’ problem record. Any action points arising from a
PPIR will become agenda items of the Cross Domain Problem Management Forum.

11 ESCALATION

Any problem requiring escalation will be as per the table below initially to the first level manager. Each
manager escalated to will then be responsible for escalating to the next manager listed, it is also
expected that escalation to the next level on either side will be agreed with the opposite manager so that
Managers of similar levels in either domain are made aware of any issues. The Problem Manager should
notify the Problem Manager in the other domain before the escalation process is initiated.

The escalation process is also used if there is debate over the validity of a problem.
