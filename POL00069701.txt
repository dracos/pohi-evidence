Subject: Supplemental disclosure list P.O -v- Castleton

Dear Mandy,

We have to serve a supplemental disclosure list on Mr Castleton setting out all documents that
have come to light since the first list dated 18 May 2006 (ideally today). With the exception of
the message store at Fujitsu, these are documents which we have already disclosed. I attach a
copy of the new list for you to approve, sign and date. Please can you then email or fax it back
to my colleague Thomas Bourne (thomas. bourne(. 4) (same fax number as me)
and Tom will arrange to serve it on Mr Castleton.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
Kind regards.
