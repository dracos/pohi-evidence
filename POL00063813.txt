CASE NO: POLTD/0506/0401

Noted. I note the circumstances which led to the apprehension of the offender
for theft / false accounting.

When apprehended for the loss of £48,000 the offender gave limited replies in
answer to questions he mainly responded “No Comment”. He suggests that
the loss may be due to problems he was experiencing with the Horizon
system. These concem the number of zero entries shown against on line
banking transactions.

I understand that checks made by the Officer suggest there are no calls to the
Helpline reporting this problem.

In interview the offender was informed that checks would be made.

1 To establish that the Horizon system was working properly (1
understand this is being done) and

2 In particular to enquire whether the zero entries could have contributed
to the £48,000 loss.

I understand from the Officer that the result of these checks (at 1 and 2
above) are awaited. Further I understand that efforts will be made to obtain
the Fujitsu records which show the underlying reason for the nil transaction.

When checking the records it may be prudent to go back to about one year
being the date the offender claims (to the Auditors) that his problems started.
If it is to be the prosecution case that the offender stole the money it will be
necessary to disprove any claims that the loss could have been attributed to
the nil transactions.

Memo

Cont...

Once records have been obtained and enquiries completed then consideration
should be given to whether or not the Defendant should be re-interviewed and
the findings put to him. If enquiries cannot be completed by the 29"
November then I suggest that the offender is re-bailed to a later date, this
could be arranged with the Police and his Solicitors.

The file should be returned in due course, together with a report or statement
outlining the procedure for dealing with on line banking transactions.
