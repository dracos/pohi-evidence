Recommend

* Carry on as we are:

We expected this — its happening

Not pleasant but manageable

If we concede it will never end — we are beyond faults with Horizon

Concession puts the whole business at risk

We have the other SPMRs/staff and customers to consider

Handling - Assume BAU

« Meet Oliver Letwin to explain our position — next week

¢ Write and confirm we will not change our position — next week
* ? Do we send an interim response to JA? — end this week
¢ Letter written with a view to publication
¢ Robust ‘have considered but not prepared to change’

* Copy letter to those MPs present and JFSA

POL00149575
POL00149575

Handling

¢ Chair
« Explain POL’s decision
* Note: Chair not likely to respond to media but will not defend POL
* If pressed, would be more anti than pro PO

¢ Working Group
* Continue as usual
* If JFSA leave we:
* Issue statement of disappointment but carry on investigating

* Consider the implications for the Scheme and will respond when we
have carefully considered our position

POL00149575

Media prep

Disappointed some have decided to speak publicly

We will not comment /provide running commentary

We set up scheme in good faith — working as anticipated

What we can expect

¢ More Fol

« PQs

Debates

Leaks

Unsubstantiated allegations

Continued media speculation

Poss legal challenge — individual/group/JR
POL00149575
POL00149575

BUT — WE CAN MANAGE THIS

¢ Not front page news

« Not a story with longevity

We have acted in good faith

More good news than bad news stories about PO

No fault with Horizon

No unsafe conviction

POL00149575

LONGER TERM

* Refreshing JR advice in light of:
* where we are now
* where we might be if MPs/JFSA go public — eg:
« JFSA leave the Working group
« Applicants withdraw en mass

« Legal challenges (individuals attempt to sue rather that mediate

« Ready to return to ExCo/subcommittee should it be

possible/necessary to reconsider approach
