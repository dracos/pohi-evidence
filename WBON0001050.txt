All

Please find attached the draft wording for the GLO section of the LOR, plus a draft of the actual Order. This has been
reviewed and approved by Tony. Your comments are most welcome.

Please note, the draft GLO is a travelling draft between us and Freeths (the attached comparison document shows the
changes from Freeths' draft to our proposal). The body of the GLO refers to a number of procedural steps and these
are still under discussion. The parts that are important for the current purposes are those that refer to the scope of the
GLO - these are at paragraph 1 and Schedule 1.

Kind regards
Andy
