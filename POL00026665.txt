e Post Office confirmed that cases will be pushed through as quickly as possible and
that extension requests were speculative as, due to unexpected absences in the
investigation team, they cannot be confirmed.

¢ KL voiced concern over lack of information given to applicants to advise them where
their case is in the Scheme. It was noted that the WG had written to all applicants
advising them to contact AB if they required an update on the progress of their case.

Action: BC to add to agenda for next face-to-face meeting on 10 July a slot to
discuss:
1. Notifying applicants individually about case progress

2. Whether cases should be passed to SS if PO investigation not completed by
deadline

6. Cases with Second Sight to review PO investigation reports

SS explained that the original deadlines they set were too ambitious and they have

slipped due to focus

on the Part Two report.

SS confirmed that the Part Two report should be ready for review by the WG by 3”
week in July (w/c 14 July) and that 10 July was an unrealistic deadline.

SS confirmed that where a case included elements of the Themes covered by the
Part Two report, they intend to disclose this when releasing the draft CRR.

Post Office and SS agreed that the Part Two report must be factually correct and
dialogue should take place between the two parties to ensure this is the case
however SS stated that it is for them as editors of the report to determine the issues
covered in the report.

For discussion:
« M054: Chair issued his decision to WG decision re mediation 25/06

Chair asked all parties to consider the steps to be taken to inform applicant of the decision
not to mediate the case. KL raised a concern about sharing the Chair's decision with the
applicant. The Chair noted this concern and asked the WG to consider how best to proceed.
AB voiced concern about the additional time delay this would cause the applicant, but
agreed that the WG should take time to consider how to proceed in this case.

Action: BC to add to agenda for next face-to-face meeting on 10 July.

« M062: Draft report yet to be issued to applicant — applicant wishes to appoint a
professional advisor (De Nahlik). Belinda Crowe’s email of 24 June refers.

WG agreed to adopt BC’s suggested approach and issue report to the applicant along with a
funding agreement to be returned within 7 days and with a deadline for comments on SS’s
draft CRR of 14 days from date of confirmation of funding. BC confirmed that confirmation of
funding could be issued immediately on receipt of funding application.

Action: BC to issue draft report and funding agreement as per recommended
approach.

« M048: WG agreed case suitable for mediation. PO noted it is in discussion with the
applicant and hoped to have resolved the case within the next couple of days.

Action: BC to issue documents to parties and CEDR.

* M076: WG agreed case to be discussed by WG at next face-to-face meeting on 10
July.

AB queried the role of the WG in the recommendation to mediate when SS has
recommended mediation. It was noted that this was the previously agreed process, and the
one followed for M054.

Action: BC to add agenda item to discuss this at the next face-to-face meeting of the
WG on 10 July.
