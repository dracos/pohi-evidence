RE: Remote Access Question

Done — confirmed ‘data integrity’ is essentially the same as ‘audit trail’.

Also confirmed that where SPMP’s have identified periods of time where mysterious transactions have taken place —
the auditors have searched the data and no ‘remote access scar’ is present and thus did not take place

This in my view is fantastic news as means that we in fact are able to prove the negative and put this to bed once and

for all.

I said we would try to get the papers over to them by COP Friday.

Hi James

Sorry for the radio silence

lam meeting a colleague on Monday morning to go through this and imagine we will get back to you
that afternoon or Tuesday.

We absolutely share the ambition to put the baseless allegations brought forward by Second Sight and
Applicants where they belong, but there is a bit of handling to be done (frustrating though that is for you
guys and for us). But very nearly there, I think.

Best wishes

Patrick

Hi Patrick,
