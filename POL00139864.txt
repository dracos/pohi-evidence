Andy,
To update you on the week's developments:

1. During the meeting in London last Friday it was agreed that we would continue with
the Samra case;

2. The meeting with Brian Altman QC has been arranged for Monday 9th September and
so we are hopeful that the file review process will resume shortly thereafter;

3. We have had meetings with BTO solicitors in Scotland and the Procurator Fiscal's
office. A Note is being prepared by Simon Clarke of Counsel.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Kind regards,
Martin.

Martin Smith
