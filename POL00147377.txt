Thank you all for your help and comments, attached is a revised version.

I will also pull together a one pager summary of media which will include high profile cases (MP, Applicant
Comments) — I'll send this round for review tomorrow.

Thanks

All
I think this is a superb piece of work — thorough and well thought through.
V’ve got a couple of points to add on top of Mike’s:

-  Anover-arching point which I will bring out at the meeting next week is that we need to maintain perspective
here: there has been very little media coverage of this and even when it featured on BBC news this was a one
day wonder. This is not complacency it is more about recognising the scale of the issue in the media
environment. A summary page on this may help?

- I think another scenario is that Matt Prodger or one of the other interested journalists contacts us proactively

to start to stir it up: at some point Prodger or one of the others will realise they haven’t written about it for a
while and contact JFSA etc... Alternatively a high profile event might prompt him/others to stoke this up again

POL00147377

-  Arelated scenario is where a development in ITC or elsewhere in the business raises Horizon/Sparrow as an
issue — a tender or procurement, or interview with Lesley (currently being managed by Nina). It’s why we
have to be very firm around external engagement which could have an impact on the Sparrow/mediation
process

- Small point I think we mean ‘citing’ rather than ‘sighting’

- Another scenario could be questions in Parliament leading to media coverage: this is probably picked up in
the existing scenarios but it might be worth making explicit

-  Onthe high profile cases, it would be good to categorise what we mean by high profile —- where has most

coverage appeared in relation to each? Are they regionally high profile or nationally etc...? Do we know of
close contacts between MP and journalist etc...

Hi

Please find attached an outline of the media and what we need to develop in terms of materials etc that we discussed
at a meeting last week. This has been developed to take to a sparrow programme board next week which Mark will
be talking at.

I would be grateful if you could have a look today and get comments back to me by 12 tomorrow.

Thanks so much

Sophie
