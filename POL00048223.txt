Dear Mrs Hamilton

Thank you for returning the completed Bank Authority Disclosure forms.
These were subsequently forwarded to the relevant banks.

Unfortunately, It would appear that neither of the banks received my
correspondence, which included the signed Bank Authority Disclosures. As
such, I would ask that you complete the two Bank Authority Disclosure
forms included with this correspondence. As soon as you are able to return
these to me I will then forward them to the relevant banks.

Please accept my apologies for any inconvenience caused by completing a
second set of forms.

Yours Sincerely

Graham Brander
