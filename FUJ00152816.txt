John,

107 calls may seem a lot but that only equates to approximately 3-4 calls a month over the time frame. To add the
information you want is going to take 1 to 2 days of uninterrupted work to complete. So to get it completed by the 26th
June is not impossible it would be cutting it fine as we had not factored this in to the time scales of the original request.
If you need the extra detail I will enquire about when we can get this to you..

The statement is fine but the mention of 107 calls will no doubt interest the defence barrister. If possible could you
include in the statement a breakdown of the calls to cover time/date/nature of call. If we don't include it now the defence
will only request this information later.
