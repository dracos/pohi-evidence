Hi Katie,

To put the response below into context, AP-ADC (Automated Payment - Additional Data Capture) are a
series of modular functions that are provided with the Horizon codeset. The APADC functions allow control
of the user interface and allow transaction designers to build an 'APADC transaction script' which calls a
series of APADC functions to capture transactional data. For example; a 'NameLong' function displays a GUI
on Horizon to capture all of the individual elements of a Name (e.g. Title, forename, middle initial,
surname) ona single screen. Adding NameLong, along with various other functions, to a transaction

script allows us to build complex transactions without requiring counter code changes by Fujitsu.

The fix deployed in April 2018 corrected the issue with two known Drop & Go functions, namely;

1) OpenAccount - An APADC transaction script that captures and transmits data when a Customer wants to
Open a Drop & Go Account. As part of the Account Opening journey, the APADC script displays a prompt to
ask the customer if they want to top up the balance of their account at the same time, and if so, processes
the account top up.

2) Balance&TopUp - An APADC transaction script that captures and transmits data when a Customer wants
to Top Up the balance of a Drop & Go Account.

From the keystroke log evidence in PC0273234 (which I have seen for the first time today), I can see that
the transaction being attempted is a different Drop & Go Function, namely;

3) Count Mails - An APADC transaction script that captures the number of items that a Customer wants to
leave with the branch to process later.

From the keystroke logs I can see that the Count Mails script also offers the Customer the opportunity to
Top Up their account as part of the Count Mails transaction. Atos were unaware of this additional
mechanism to perform a top up at the time the fix was deployed in April 2018, therefore no changes were
made to the Count Mails APADC transaction script. Atos responded to an original incident relating to the
Balance&TopUp journey. A fixed was identified and this was also applied to the OpenAccount script as we
were aware that OpenAccount also offered Top Up facilities. We missed the fact that Count Mails also offers
Top Up facilities, and therefore the fix will also need to be deployed to the Count Mails transaction as a
matter of urgency. The original author of the suite of Drop & Go transaction scripts was a Post Office
Business Analyst who has since left the business. There is no documentation available that would

have clearly identified a link to Top Up within the Count Mails transaction.

The statement in the test report alludes to the fact that there are existing issues with Recovery which were
still evident after the fix to the Top Up problem was implemented. As the fix successfully resolved the
Account Opening and Top up issue, and did not introduce additional issues during recovery, the fix was
deployed. For context, Recovery is a process that is triggered whenever the Horizon counter system has
problems, specifically;

a) the counter PC crashes midway through a transaction or

WBD_000144.000001
WBONO0000274
WBON0000274

b) loss of network connectivity occurs and the counter PC cannot communicate with the data centre. In this
instance Horizon automatically logs the user out.

On Horizon PC restart and/or user log in - Horizon checks to see if any transactions were in progress at the
point of PC/comms failure (by checking for incomplete transaction records in a 'recovery' transaction table
held within the data centre). If records are found, Horizon then triggers a Recovery APADC transaction
script. The transaction designer can create bespoke recovery scripts for each transaction type. The purpose
of the script is to make online calls to third party systems if required, and prompt the clerk for input (e.g.
‘was cash payment taken for the transaction before failure’? or 'was a receipt produced?'). Based on the
information received from the clerk or third party, the recovery script can then complete the original
transaction if required, or finish cleanly if no recovery actions are required. The clerk can then continue
with their business.

I've just received a separate call relating to recovery last week and have been provided keystroke logs that
detail the issue. This issue was originally raised as a Service Incident, but the resolving team (Information
Services) were unable to identify the issue. As I have some awareness of the Drop & Go transaction scripts, I
agreed to look into the issue amongst other workload. I will prioritise this now and will work with

the resolving team to implement a fix to the Count Mails transaction.

Regards

James

Hi James

Thank you for sending through the test report and for your time during our call last month, both of which have been
really useful. I have a couple of very important, but hopefully small, follow-on questions that I'd be grateful if ATOS
could come back to us on this week, ideally tomorrow:

Peak PC0273234, attached, indicates that a further instance of the issue occurred in August 2018, four months after
the changes to the scripts were released to live on 19 April 2018. Can ATOS please confirm:

a. If this was a further instance of the problem or an unrelated problem.

b. If this was a further instance of the problem, why it occurred after the earlier fix? Was it the case that

the script didn't go live in April 2018? Was it the case that it wasn't released to all branches?

We need a full response to these points, together with relevant supporting documentation to evidence how ATOS dealt
with the August 2018 issue, as currently it looks as though a fix was implemented that didn't work in practice.
What does the APADC script do?
What does the Open Account script do?
Section 3 of the Test Report, extract below, is confusing and implies as though there is a separate issue here. Can you
explain the below note please as simply as possible for us?

Note: Recovery scenarios working same as earlier. We observed that with the transaction
where cash was not taken from the customer horizon behaved correctly, processing the zero
value transaction. But the customers Drop & Go account has the increased the balance. This
is the live behaviour and not connected with this fix.

Whilst writing, a separate query has arisen that you may be able to help me with. This relates to an issue involving the
ATOS recovery script. I may need to send you some more information but I wondered as an initial point whether you
would be able to explain what the recovery script does please?

Kind regards

Katie

WBON0000274

Attached is the test report issued by a member of my team at the time of the issue resolution.

Following review of the test report, the Information Services Team released the change as follows;

These script versions were processed as a single change RADC/1804/006, which was submitted, processed

and loaded by Fujitsu on 11/04/18.

This change was released to live on 19/04/18 (ver18065)

Kind regards,

Katie,

I have spoken to the person who made the change and here are summary answers. If you want to call to
talk these through with us please do call me.

an

. How the issue was fixed

Atos were alerted to the error by Fujitsu on 2 March 2018.

Previous errors had occurred but this was the first time that Fujitsu were able to capture the key logs.
This enabled Atos to recreate the error and identify the bug.

Once this was identified a fix was developed, tested and delivered into production using the normal
change management processes.

Delivery to live took place on 19 April 2018.

2. An explanation of the issue

The underlying issue was that the system did not manage time-outs for Drop and Go properly. When
a message was sent to a banking system and no reply was received the Horizon transaction carried on
‘assuming’ that a reply had been received.

The fix ensured that the Horizon system waited for the response and where none was received put up
and error message so that the transaction could be safely redone.

Kind regards,
David

Thank you for your email. We're looking to complete the attached bug note and largely need your help with the points
highlighted in yellow, including:

1. How the issue was fixed.

2. A simple explanation of the issue — currently we have " Reconciliation between the Horizon feed and the
Accenture CDP system identified that only one top-up had been received by Accenture CDP but two were being
shown it the Horizon Batch Feed. The second Horizon transaction matched the CDP transaction, confirming
the problem was with the first transaction." — it would be helpful if this could be expanded on/ explained as fully
as possible.

Happy to have a call if the above and attached are still unclear — I can be free for a call between 3.30 and 4.30 today if
you let me know when is best for you.

Kind regards

Katie

Katie,

I have done some digging on this and it doesn’t look like we have a lot of information relating to this issue.
It would be helpful to understand what you are looking for so we can see if there is anything that could be
useful.

If you want to discuss this please do give me a call.

Hi David

Barry is out of the office today, I've been asked to communicate to you directly. Barry has been in touch with your team

separately on this

I wondered if you would be able to come back to me today in terms of an ETA for a full response from atos please on
the Bug 28 response for the ongoing litigation? The plan is currently to include these bug summaries as part of the

Counsel team’s written closings in the Horizon Issues Trial so we just want to be sure on timings of response.

What’s this all about?

. One of the bugs that we need atos' support with has been called the 'Drop and Go' bug. Fujitsu have confirmed they
are not aware of the Drop and Go business process and are therefore unable to comment on whether the issue was
caused by user error or a fault with the APADC script. Ideally we want to understand what happened in this particular
instance, if it is a known issue with the script and, if so, how this was resolved. In terms of relevant documents, please
