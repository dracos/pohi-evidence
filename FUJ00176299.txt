Dear Mike
Lost Data and Audit Trail
I refer to Keith Baines’ letter dated 28 August 2002.

In my letter of 15 August to Keith I provided a detailed analysis of this issue. I do not
consider it necessary to do so again in this letter. However, I confirm that Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Limited’s view remains as stated in my letter of 15 August.
Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Limited does not consider it is or was in breach of the
various contractual obligations and clauses set out in Keith’s letter of 6 February.

Yours. sincerely... +
