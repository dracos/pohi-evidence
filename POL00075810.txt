Could you please delete Ron’s AOL account from your file. ’ve told him that this shouldn’t be used.
He’ll pick up on that. Need to use his SS address.

Best wishes

On our last WG call, you asked Post Office to make clear which cases it considers are suitable for mediation before the
face to face meeting tomorrow. You also asked Belinda to ensure that this information was copied to Second Sight so I
have cc'd Ron and lan.

Having carefully considered Second Sight's Final CRRs, Post Office's position on mediation is set out below. We will
explain at the meeting tomorrow our reasons for taking these positions.

Kind regards

Andy
