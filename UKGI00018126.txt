2012 Mails & Retail — Government Network Subsidy Financial Services Telecoms 2013
Services Payment

The decrease in year on year total revenue of £21m (3.6%) to £583m (2012 £604m) is
driven by the £3m decrease in the Network Subsidy Payment, and a decrease of £18m in
like for like income.

The following commentary gives further detail on the revenue variances by category:

6.1.1 Mails

The £10.2m (6.0%) decrease in Mails Revenue is driven by volume reductions following the
Royal Mail price changes implemented this year and the unusually high comparative prior
year figure due to the buy forward of stamps before the May 2012 price increase.

« Approximately £9.6m was driven by volume decreases, (mainly stamps, labels and
parcels) and the remainder by price increases.

UKGI00018126
UKG100018126

« The new Mails Distribution Agreement resulted in an on-going reduction of the fixed fee
with a £0.4m impact in the first half of this year.

Mails & Retail Income is analysed in the table below:

Total Mails & Retail 184.3 196.0 (11.7) (11.7) 0.0

6.1.2 Retail & Lottery
Retail and Lottery revenues have decreased by £2.1m:
« Lottery is £0.7m lower than last year, driven by fewer rollovers.

« Retail is down by £1.4m due to lower sales than last half year as the prior year included
revenue from collectibles from the Olympic and Paralympic games, as well as the
Diamond Jubilee.

6.1.3. Government Services
The £9.2m (11%) decrease in Government Services revenue is principally due to:
« £6.8m lower DVLA revenues due to new contract related lower price and lower volumes.

« £3.6m adverse from falling numbers of POCA accounts, through natural attrition,
migration of customers to bank accounts.

This was offset by

6.1.4 Telecoms

The Telecoms Services pillar includes the Post Office Homephone and Broadband services,
as well as mobile top-up services and phonecards.

Telecoms Services revenue of £65m (2012: £63m) has increased by £2.3m. Income from
the Post Office Homephone and Broadband product rose by £3.5m, primarily due to higher
average revenue per user.

More attractive packages were introduced in May 2012 to attract and retain higher value
customers. Income from mobile top-ups was £1m below prior year, as transaction volumes

10

UKGI00018126
UKG100018126

declined due to the mobile networks actively migrating customers away from pre-pay, and
also reducing their transaction fees. Despite this reduction in income, Post Office is still a
significant player in the top-up market. Our share of the retail market has been maintained
at around 5%.

6.1.5 Financial Services

Financial Services income has increased by £1.0m year on year. This continues the trend
of increases in new products offsetting the decline of traditional products. Overall PFS
(defined as Post Office savings, insurance, travel, mortgages and transaction services) is up
by £11.0m (23%) year on year. By product the main variances are:

« a £8m increase in savings products mainly Growth Bonds £3.1m, Reward Saver
£2.8m, ISA £2.1m. These increases follow the completion of the ‘Eagle’ deal in
September 2012.

« a £1.3m increase in Mortgages as this a new product,

« a £1.1m increase in Insurance revenues driven by the new BOI contract and better
rates,

« a £0.8m increase in MoneyGram driven by higher volumes, and

« a £0.7m increase in ATM revenue, driven by increased volumes as machines reach
maturity.

This was offset by

« a £4.5m decline in NS& revenues driven by the new contract. Revenue is from
Premium Bonds only as NS&I look to provide most of their products through their own
direct channel,

« a£4.5m net decrease in Banking revenue from:

o a £2.7m decrease in business banking revenues due to rate reduction from
renegotiated contract,

© a £2.2m fall from the DWP exceptions (cash cheques and green giros). This work
has now ceased, offset by

© an increase of £0.5m in personal banking.

« A£1.8m decrease from Payment Services due to:
o a£1.1m decrease in Postal Order income as the product is in decline, and

o a £0.7m decline from bill payments, as utilities and other bill payment clients
continue to migrate customers to other payment methods such as direct debit and
online.

7.2 People Costs (2013 £131m vs 2012 £128m)

7.2.1 People costs (2013 £131m vs 2012 £128m)

People costs have increased in total by £3.3m (2.6%) to £103.9m, representing 23.7% (2012
22.5%) of the cost base.

The number of people employed increased by 87 to 7,999 at 29 Sept 2013 (2012 7,912),
primarily due to the Network Transformation Programme. NTP people costs are included
within exceptional costs. The transfer to exceptional costs is done by a move of the ‘fully
loaded’ staff cost (including NI and pensions) from the wages and salaries line. This
maintains the integrity of pensions and NI for disclosure purposes but means that variances
across the categories need to be viewed in aggregate.

The people cost movement comprises:

e Wages and Salaries have decreased by £1.1m (1.3%), but as noted above, must be viewed
in conjunction with the increase in NI of £0.6m (6.8%) and an element of the pension costs
increase as the movement of Network Transformation staff costs to exceptionals
encapsulates all 3. When viewed in this way, the variance is broadly flat year on year.

« Pension costs have increased by £1.2m (9.1%), driven primarily by the increase in the IAS19
pension rate from 18.2% to 20.6%.

e Productivity costs have increased by £3.6m (51%), and are predominantly due to
productivity costs under accrual of £1.5m in 2012-13 and a £1.1m increase in the LTIP
accrual as none was booked in 2012-13 following an over provision in 2011-12.

© Overtime has increased by £0.1m (2.7%).

Temporary resource costs have decreased by £0.8m (22%), as a result of reduced
recruitment and lower agency labour in Network.

7.2.2 People Numbers

The following analysis shows the movements in the number of people employed during the
half year.

The People numbers were as follows:

Period end employees Average employees
29 Sept 2013 23 Sept 2012 2013 2012
Total employees 7,999 7.912 7,946 7.867

7.2.3. Average Cost Per Employee

The 2013 average number of employees for the half year ending 29 Sept 2013 was 7,946
(2012 7,867). The average annual cost per employee (excluding exceptional costs and
exceptional heads) based on these averages has increased by £1,730 (5.2%) to £35,085
(2012 £33,355), but this is distorted by the increase in productivity costs. Excluding the

13

73

7.3.3

UKGI00018126
UKG100018126

productivity impact, the averages has increased by only £632 (2.0%) to £32,217 (2012
£31,584) due to pay awards (Supply Chain) and the pension rate.

Other Operating Costs (2013 £422m vs 2012 £437m)

Subpostmasters costs (2013 £220m vs 2012 £235m). Total subpostmasters costs
decreased by £15.0m (7%). £9.3m of this was due to lower sales, including the impact of
Mails buy forward last year pre the May price increase. £2.2m due to lower fixed pay from
unfreezing the Core Tier Payment and roll out of Locals and £2.7m relating to the DVLA
rate reduction accrual impact.

The average annual cost per subpostmaster branch (excluding VAT and NI) is £40,549
(2012 £42,892). This is a 5.5% decrease on the prior year and reflects the higher income
last year relating to stamps buy forward.

Collection, Delivery & Conveyance costs have decreased by £0.5m due to ATM
replenishment costs, which were paid to an external company, now being fulfilled by internal
Supply Chain staff.

Property Facilities costs have increased by £0.3m, due to an increase in the provision for the
extension of business rates to ATM's.

Property Maintenance costs has increased by £0.7m, due to the Network Transformation
Programme.

Computers and Telephones costs have increased by £1.9m, mainly due to Horizon Fujitsu
Costs of £1.2m and software licences of £0.6m.

Consultancy, Marketing & Legal Fees have increased by £3.5m year on year. £1.1m of this is
offset with the staff and agent related costs line below for Skills group off charges for project
activity. £1.6m relates to increased marketing costs, prior year rebranding was within
project one- off costs, £0.6m relates to increased consultancy costs for SPMO Operating
model and mutualisation and £0.5m increased legal costs relating primarily to separation.
The remainder relates to decrease in database management and Estate fees.

UKGI00018126
UKG100018126

7.3.7 Finance costs have increased by £2.7m, driven by the ceasing of the Bureau rebate of
£2.2m (ceased October 2012) and increased bank charges of £0.4m. The remainder is
losses related.

7.3.8 Cost of Sales has decreased by £1.4m (2.4%), driven by lower Retail costs due to Olympic
and Jubilee collectables. The main reasons are detailed below:

years and has been recognised evenly through the year.
8.2 Project one off costs

Project one off costs are non exceptional costs of project activity in the year. They
increased in 2012-13 as the pace of implementation towards the new plan continued but
have decreased in 2013-14. These costs do not form part of the underlying business as

usual performance of the company.

UKGI00018126

9. Pensions
91 Background
The Post Office participates in pensions schemes and detailed below:

Scheme Eligibility Type

Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP) UK employees Defined benefit

Royal Mail Senior Executive Pension Plan (RMSEPP) I UK senior executives (closed) Defined benefit

Royal Mail Defined Contribution Plan (RMDCP) UK employees Defined contribution

On 1 April 2012 almost all of the assets and liabilities of the Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP)
were transferred to HM Government. On this date the RMPP was also sectionalised with Royal
Mail Group Limited and Post Office Limited responsible for their own sections. Royal Mail Group
Limited is the principal employer in the Royal Mail Senior Executive Pension Plan (RMSEPP)
and the Royal Mail Defined Contribution Plan (RMDCP). Post Office Limited became a
participating employer in both with effect from 1 April 2012. Royal Mail Pensions Trustees
Limited manages the main defined benefit scheme Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP) which has
around 5,200 Post Office active members.

At the September 2013 half year the emphasis has been on the RMPP plan, as the movements
in the 7% share of RMSEPP are considered not to be significant to the Interim Report.
However, the RMSEPP has been reviewed and Post Office 7% share of the RMSEPP surplus has
increased by £1m to £2m driven by an improvement in asset values. An actuarial gain of £1m
has therefore been recognised in the period.

9.2 Assumptions

IAS 19 revised requires a number of assumptions. The choice of assumptions used for the
calculations is the responsibility of the Directors, based upon advice given by an independent
actuary. The key assumptions for the half year to 29 September 2013 are set out in the table
below.

Towers Watson has confirmed that the assumptions have been determined in a manner
consistent with those used for the disclosures at 31 March 2013, and any relevant adjustments
to 29 September 2013 have been made. Conversations with Royal Mail management confirm
that it is their intention to adopt the same assumptions. The rate of increase in pensionable
salaries has been adjusted from RPI +1% to RPI to reflect the impact of the change to terms
arising from Project Robin as explained in paragraph 9.3.

Movements in the defined benefit surplus

The movement in the RMPP defined benefit surplus during the six months to 29 September
2012 is detailed below. Scheme assets are assessed at fair value at the balance sheet date. For
example, quoted equities are valued at the latest ‘bid’ price. Scheme liabilities are discounted
using a high quality corporate bond rate. The IAS 19R surplus/deficit is usually therefore
different to the cash funding surplus/deficit (the “actuarial” valuation) assessed by the Trustees,
for which the scheme liabilities are discounted using the expected returns available on scheme
assets.

During the period there was a consultation exercise with members of the defined benefit Royal
Mail Pension Plan on proposed changes to the terms (Project Robin). These changes were
agreed and implemented on 15 October 2013. The key change was to the definition of
pensionable pay which broadly will increase in line with RPI (capped at 5%) in future regardless
of actual pay growth. The changes have resulted in a one-off exceptional gain of £102 million.

The current service cost is intended to represent the amount by which the liabilities will
increase due to employing active members for one more year. The current service cost,
expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay is 20.6% for RMPP (2012 18.2%). The charge in
the income statement for the defined contribution scheme was £1m in the half year to 29
September 2013, and payments of £11m were made in respect of RMPP future service
contributions at a rate of 17.1% (2012 17.1%).

The net financing credit of £2m, a non-cash item, is reported under finance income and
reassessed annually.

Actuarial gains and losses are recorded directly in the statement of changes in equity (and not

the income statement). The actuarial loss of £37m during the half year arose primarily due to a
greater than expected decrease in assets as a result of changes in market conditions.

9.4 Assessment of recoverability of surplus under IFRIC 14

In order to recognise a surplus it is necessary to prove that the Post Office could recover the
surplus either through lower future contributions or through a refund. Royal Mail took legal
advice both before and after sectionalisation. This confirmed that Post Office Limited and Royal
Mail Group Limited have absolute rights to the assets left over in their individual sections after
benefits have been secured if the RMPP terminates. There is no trigger for termination in the
Trust Deed but that does not mean that the RMPP cannot terminate. It would be wound up by
the courts, or the Regulator, or when the last beneficiary dies. Towers Watson has calculated
that Post Office Limited would be able to recover £103 million of the £164 million surplus in
RMPP through lower contributions and the remaining £61 million could therefore be recovered
through a refund. The element of surplus that is recoverable through a refund would be
subject to a 35% withholding tax and therefore the overall surplus on the balance sheet has
been reduced by £21 million to £143 million. The element that is recoverable through lower
contributions has resulted in a deferred tax liability of £21m, which is consistent with the
deferred tax credit recognised in the year to 31 March 2013 and therefore no further tax
consequence has been recognised in the half year to 29 September 2013.

Government Grants - In April 2013 the Post Office received grants totalling £215m from the
Government, (April 2012 £200m) to fund capital projects and transformation.

Amounts utilised in the respective half years are as shown with the 2013/14 utilisation
including £31m relating to network and IT transformational costs incurred in 2012/13 for
which there was insufficient grant in that year.

Restructuring costs - include the costs (£55m) of delivery of a major change in the network.
Network Transformation introduces new style agency offices and seeks to improve
fundamentally the profitability of the Crown network. The IT Transformation programme will
create the IT infrastructure appropriate for an independent group with ambitious growth plans
and incurred a further £5m. Other costs included are business separation of £2m and
redundancy of £2m.

Network Transformation comprises costs of £15m for Subpostmasters’ compensation and
£40m programme costs. The £40m spent on Network Transformation is analysed below:

Interest payable on the BIS Loan fell last year as the average borrowing volume significantly
decreased due to funding receipts attributable to transformational programmes. This position
continued with £200m received in 2012-13 and £215m in 2013-14.

Finance leases are nearing conclusion and both arrangements covering counter printers and
the AEI equipment finish in 2014-15 - accordingly interest is reducing.

Other finance costs include commitment fees to BIS for the Post Office credit facility, and
charges to RBS for their note sorting facility.

Cash within the Post Office Limited network (Sept 2013 £825m vs March 2013 £870m)

The reduction in Post Office network cash from March 2013 levels is due to the year-end
coinciding with Easter necessitating increased branch and cash centre holdings.

Loans and borrowings (Sept 2013 £nil vs March 2013 £291m)
Daily borrowing requirements in the first half of 2013/14 are significantly lower than the year

end loan position on account of advanced government funding of both the £215m
transformational funding and £200m Network Subsidy.

Obligations under finance leases (current & non-current) (Sept 2013 £5m vs March 2013
£7m)

The obligations under finance leases have decreased by £2m in the half year attributable to
lease repayments in 2013-14. Lease types are shown in section 13.2.

Loan facilities

At half year the Post Office had no external (non Government) borrowing facilities in place.

12. Going concern

Post Office Limited has net cash and cash equivalents of £855m (section 11.2) and a
borrowing facility of £1,150m of which none (section 11.4) was drawn down at 29 September
2013.

12.1 Background

On 24 March 2010 a funding agreement was agreed that provided up to £180m for
compensation for losses sustained in parts of the Network in 2011-12, as well as providing
access to the working capital facility to 31 March 2016. These arrangements received State
Aid approval on 23 March 2011 through the working capital facility was limited until 34
March 2012.

A further funding agreement with Government was announced on 27 October 2010 which
provided for:

¢ Funding of £410m for 2012-13 (received 2 April 2012)

e Funding of £415m for 2013-14 (received 2 April 2013)

e Funding of £330m for 2014-15

e Extension of the existing working capital facility with BIS of £1.15bn up to 31
March 2016

State Aid approval for the funding for 2012-13 to 2014-15 was received on 28 March 2012.
It was also recognised that the working capital facility was no longer deemed State Aid.
However, no drawing under the facility may extend past the Final Maturity Date (341 March
2016).

The going concern analysis is based on the latest draft 2020 strategic plan financials
presented to the Post Office Board in April 2013 and forming part of Government funding
discussions.

12.2 Assessment for the Post Office

Post Office has finished implementing its 2005-11 strategic plan and has completed its
closure programme. It posted an operating profit before exceptional items for the first time
for a number of years in 2008-09 and has continued to do so, but still operates with a cash
outflow with the exception of 2012-13. The 2011-15 plan is intended to reverse the trend of
an increasing Network Subsidy Payment (NSP) with the draft strategic plan beyond 2014-15
continuing that reducing trend.

The 2011-15 strategic plan updated for latest views has been shown in Table 11 of this
section, and shows that Post Office has sufficient cash headroom to continue to trade. The
available facility has been defined to include network cash, ATM cash, ATM debtor, POCA
debtor and SGEI cheques. Downsides have been applied that the funding for NSP and
transformation post March 2015 is not available and that the growth and savings plans are
not fully delivered. Subject to ceasing spend on transformation post March 2015, there could
still be sufficient headroom to trade. It should be noted that there is a dependency on the
working capital loan being extended beyond its current end date of 31 March 2016.

The one year funding deal for 2011-12 added the ability to borrow up to £50m from other
sources, as well as the up to £50m in finance leases previously allowed, which would improve
the headroom capacity shown if required.

24

UKGI00018126
UKG100018126

12.3. Summary conclusion

Based on the analysis there is available borrowing headroom until March 2016 and until
March 2017 if it is assumed that the working capital loan can be extended for another year.
Royal Mail Group Limited is a key trading partner with Post Office Limited and, in arriving at
the conclusion that Post Office Limited is a going concern, the assumption is made that Royal
Mail Group Limited is a going concern or that an alternative mails provider would work
similarly with Post Office Limited providing a similar level of income.

It is believed that Post Office Limited will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due in the
foreseeable future. It is therefore expected that the directors will consider it appropriate to
prepare the accounts on a going concern basis.

Table 1

This table shows the 2020 strategic plan projections for 2014-15 and beyond. It demonstrates

positive headroom throughout the plan period assuming funding post 2015 is agreed. If it is not there

would be a need to take management action.

Table 2

This table sets out the impact of theoretical downside scenarios if the plan does not generate the
income streams anticipated, the network programmes fail to deliver the benefits and if the pension
scheme costs increase.

Management actions have been identified to manage the lack of future funding and downside risk
within the headroom. There are further actions that could be taken but are not required. These
include the sale of property and/ or tax losses.

However, it is required to assume that the loan is extended beyond March 2016.

The increase in sales ledger is largely explained by the £5m debtor at September 2013 for
DWP card account income (March 2013 DWP debtor: £nil). Mainly the DWP adhere to agreed
terms and pay the month following invoice receipt though there are instances when the DWP

settle in-month.

The increase in homephone debt is due to POL switching provider from BT to Fujitsu. Fujitsu
are currently experiencing difficulties and have not invoiced customers for September 2013,

increasing customer debt levels. Other variances largely net off,

Receivable balances in relation to former subpostmasters of £8m have been provided for in
full in line with previous years. This is due to the difficulty in recovering these amounts. The

remaining £5m of subpostmaster debt which is unprovided against relates to current

subpostmasters debt which are usually settled through a deduction from remuneration. The
balances are provided for when they reach 60 days old for single subpostmasters or 90 days

for multiples.

The reason for the significant difference in Client levels between September 2013 and March
13 is due to the coinciding of the March 2013 year end with Easter, which increased

transactional activity and also temporarily extended settlements into 2013-14 because of the
bank holiday.

Accrued income represents the majority of this amount (September 2013: £39m, March
2013: £34m), and year on year the product components are similar. The larger accruals at
September 2013 are: DWP card account income for September £7m, Homephone £6m and
Bank of Ireland commissions £7m.

Additionally there are prepayments of £20m at September 2013 (March 2013 £36m). There
are two main elements: a £12m (March 2013 £28m) advance payment to Fujitsu in respect
of the 2013-14 managed service, and £4m (March 2013 £12m) - also to Fujitsu - for 2013-

Trade payables at March 2013 included a one-off entry for Clydesdale Bank of £7m. The
remaining reduction in trade payables balances relates to the purchase ledger and Fujitsu and

BT in particular where y/e invoice levels were high.

Within agent pay balances at March 2013 is a £3m one-off accrual for DVLA payments to
agents and £7m product pay due on account of March being a five week period. (September

March balances were impacted by the Easter bank holiday coinciding with the Post Office’s

year end, having the effect of increasing the settlement timescale temporarily. The DVLA
balance was most affected by the coinciding of year end with calendar month end.

During 2013/14 a new DVLA contract provides for changed settlement terms which has the

effect of increasing the balance on hand and is cashflow positive for Post Office Ltd.

The Network Transformation provision relates to compensation payments due to
subpostmasters who have signed up to the new contract terms or for a termination payment
at September 2013.

Crown conversions relates to the contract with WH Smith for the original tranche of Crown
outlets franchised. The new contract relating to these branches is not considered onerous and
future income growth assumptions have been overlayed onto the existing provision,
prompting the exceptional release of £1m. This provision effectively concludes in 2014/15.

Other provisions at September include onerous property lease obligations £3m, personal
injury claims £1m, redundancy £2m, Bank of Ireland sales capability investment (Eagle
provision) £3m and the ATM business rate provision £2m.

17. Litigation and Claims- Potential Claims regarding Horizon

17.1 Post Office Limited has received various claims from subpostmasters (SPMs) alleging defects
in the Horizon system and Post Office Limited’s internal processes.

These allegations were initially made in 5 claims brought through solicitors Shoosmiths.
Similar allegations have been made through:

e = SPMs’ MPs;
e — the “Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance” (JFSA);

e defences to court proceedings brought by Post Office Limited to recover debts from
SPMs; and

e direct contact with Post Office Limited.

17.2 On 8 July 2013, Second Sight published an Interim Report finding shortcomings in Post
Office Limited’s internal training and support to SPMs on the Horizon system, but no
systemic problems with Horizon itself.

17.3 Following the Second Sight Interim Report, on 27 August 2013 Post Office Limited launched
a Mediation Scheme aimed at finally resolving individual complaints made about Horizon.

17.4 Sir Anthony Hooper has been appointed as Chair of the Working Group overseeing the
Mediation Scheme. He will chair his first meeting on 25 October 2013.

17.5 The Mediation Scheme has received 64 applications from sub-postmasters since it was
opened at the end of August, of which 44 have been formally accepted onto the scheme to
date. Only 1 case has been excluded at this stage, on the grounds that it is subject to an
ongoing legal process: all the other cases are either still being reviewed, are awaiting further
information or need to go through Post Office Limited’s normal investigation processes
before they would be referred to mediation. The application closure date is the 18
November 2013. SPMs will then have a month to complete their full applications before
Post Office Limited review the cases in detail. The aim is to get some cases into the
mediation process before the end of 2013 with the majority happening between January
and March.

17.6 Post Office Limited is also reviewing past and present criminal prosecutions brought against
SPMs to ensure they continue to satisfy the evidential, public interest, and disclosure
standards required for prosecutions. This review should be completed by the end of October
2013.

17.7 Post Office Limited’s external firm of criminal solicitors, Cartwright King (CK), has now
completed a review of 301 cases subject to past prosecution to identify whether Post Office
Limited has a duty to disclose the findings of the Second Sight report and associated issues.
CK has concluded that disclosure is appropriate in 10 of these cases, and a short letter has
therefore been sent to each of the defence teams to bring their attention to the report. It is
now a matter for the defence in each case to determine what action, if any, they might take
in light of this additional information. Post Office Limited is also awaiting an unknown
number of further historical prosecution files from Royal Mail, although at this stage Post
Office Limited has no reason to believe these will substantially increase the number of actual
disclosures. In view of the potential interest from the Criminal Cases Review Commission,
Post Office Limited commissioned a review by Brian Altman QC of the prosecution

procedures it has followed. He concluded that Post Office Limited is complying with its duties
and that the approach adopted by the prosecution team was “fundamentally sound”.

17.8 Post Office Limited is not issuing any new criminal summons pending the instruction of a
new, independent expert who can give evidence to support the Horizon system. The process
of identifying this expert is under way.

17.9 To date, no claim has been made against Post Office Limited in the civil courts, and no
appeal has been made to the Court of Appeal against any conviction obtained in the criminal
courts.

17.10 Post Office Limited has instructed Brian Altman QC to undertake a second review, which will
look at Post Office Limited’s prosecutions approach in the context of its wider business
needs.

Taxation
Income statement
A breakdown of the tax credit is shown in the table below:
Half year to Half year to
29 September 23 September
2013 2012
£m £m
Corporation tax credit for period - 7
Tax under provided in previous periods - -
Current tax - 7
Deferred tax credit relating to the origin and reversal of temporary differences 2 11
Income tax credit reported in the condensed consolidated income statement 2 18

Factors affecting tax credits

An additional deferred tax credit has been recognised in relation to the retirement benefit
surplus on the balance sheet as the proportion of this surplus which is considered to be
recoverable through future contributions moved in the half year to 29 September 2013. An

equal and opposite entry has been recognised through equity.

The Group (POL and subsidiaries) has significant tax losses that are available for offset
against future taxable profits. It also has unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to fixed
asset timing differences. These tax losses/deferred tax assets could be recognised in the
future should suitable taxable profits arise. The tax losses/unrecognised deferred tax assets
means that the Group should not incur any tax charges for the foreseeable future.
