Guildford Crown Court 30th November 2009 (Four day trial)

Can you please assist with the following three points.

1. Andy Dunks of fujitsu is required as a witness in this trial and I would
be grateful if you could inform him of the dates.

2. The defence will be calling there own expert to analyse the Horizon data
as the defendant is now claiming that some of the loss in this case is
caused by errors within Horizon. Therefore, I will need transaction log

data covering the period 30th June 2005 to 14th January 2008 together with
a covering witness statement.

3. Finally, in his statement Andy Dunks makes mention of the fact that this
PO has made 107 calls to the Horizon System Helpdesk during Mrs Misra's
term as subpostmaster. A further too statement is required from Andy Dunks
in which he will exhibit a CD containing the details of the reasons for the

107 calls. Andy is aware of what I require but wants me to make my request
through the casework team.
