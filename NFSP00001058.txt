Dear Mr Bates I

Horizon System

Thank you for your letters of 17 December 2003 and 7 January 2004. I note that
Betty Williams has written to Allan Leighton.

I can go no higher within the Royal Mail group than Allan Leighton, and I am sure
that your Member of Parliament will have as much, if not more, success than I would. I
Hopefully, therefore, you will have further information from that route. }

In relation to errors which members considered were due to Horizon problems, the
Executive Council set up a Joint Federation/Post Office Ltd group who visit the
Horizon helpline site to discuss and resolve issues. It is my understanding that Post
Office Ltd can trace the nature of any error including telephone calls relating to the
same when the Horizon System is in question and, therefore, should be able to
Produce evidence that all is, in fact, correct from their side,

We are not in a position to provide information regarding other Subpostmaster’s
dealings with Post Office Ltd. We are aware that there were some disputes around {
the time that offices migrated from the manual system to the Horizon System, but we I
are now of the view that Horizon works well and that there are no real problems in
Post Offices which are operated by the Horizon System.

Dear Mrs Williams
Thank you for your letter dated 8° January and the enclosure from Richard Baker.

Jam still concerned that the review of the case is to be undertaken internally by Post Office Ltd.

When I received the letter of termination of contract from them dated 5" August 2003 I wrote to

Allen Leighton’s office, who looked into the matter and eventually responded on 27" August.

Their letter totally failed to address the points raised of the core issue, it also showed that they had . {
only reviewed their position and that they had registered the name of Craig-y-don Post Office. Not I
once did anyone from Post Office [td contact me or try to discuss the issues with me, i

If Sandy Stephen is to review the case in its entirety he will obviously need to contact myself and I
will ensure I am available to provide him with the information he requests.

cannot help feel that this is yet another attempt by Post Office Ltd to close the matter without

responding to the core issues of this case. In their latest response to you I note that they have not
once referred to the questions in my last letter, I trust they will include the answers to you when ‘
they have completed their review. I

Thank you for your letter of 23 December 2003, addressed to Allan
Leighton, enclosing a copy of a letter from your constituent Alan Bates -
. ex-subpostmaster at Post Office®, Craig-y-don branch.
Mr Bates raises a number of issues, many of which were addressed in
my letter of 1** December. I stand by all the points I made in that letter.

I also stand by my comment that at the heart of Mr Bates’ concerns is
his belief that the Horizon system is corrupt. A position substantiated, I I
believe, by the comments Mr Bates makes on his website

postofficevictims.org.uk

These things said, Mr Bates quite obviously has a deep-seated belief
that he has been treated unjustly by Post Office Ltd. In an attempt to
bring this matter to a conclusion, I am asking an independent member
of my senior management team - Sandy Stephen, Head of Area for
Scotland - to review the case in its entirety.

[ will write to you again once that review has been completed.

Yours sincerely

As per your request I have enclosed copies of the correspondence which has been taking
place between my MP and myself as well as copies of the responses she has received. I have
collated them in chronological order though it is too soon to expect a reply from my MP to
my last letter.

I seem to remember hearing at the Llandudno conference that it was proposed a list of
Horizon problems was to be collated by the Federation, did it ever happen? Is there anyone
you can suggest I talk to? I have also been hearing stories about others having their suboffices
removed by Post Office Ltd over Horizon issues, do you have any information on other cases
or others fighting Post Office Ltd over Horizon? This is an area I am planning to explore in
the new year when I will be trying to highlight the problems in the national press, hence the
banner and website.

“an essential part of everyday life” www.postoffice.co.uk

You letter to Allan Leighton of 19 November, enclosing a letter from
your constituent Mr Alan Bates, has been passed to me for reply. I will
attempt to address each of the points raised in Mr Bates letter in turn.

On the first point, all I can say is that there is a difference of opinion,
between ourselves and Mr Bates, over conversations that have taken
place.

On the second point, concerning the Horizon system and the reasons
for the termination of Mr Bates contract, I refer to our letter to Mr Bates
of 20 August. I have no doubt whatsoever that my operations team
have acted wholly professionally in this matter and had legitimate
grounds upon which to terminate Mr Bates contract with Post Office
Ltd. No 'smokescreen' is being created, nor do we lack any confidence
in the integrity of the Horizon system.

Mr Bates third point concerns his recent experience following a specific
foreign currency transaction. I have investigated this particular issue in
some depth. The outcome of this investigation suggests, very clearly,
that the Horizon system was not at fault. Indeed, there is evidence to
suggest that the instructions to Mr Bates for dealing with the problern
he faced, were not followed correctly.

On Mr Bates specific point about the availability of Horizon data, I can
confirm that data is only held locally for 30 days. However, after that
period, the data is not lost to us. All data is archived and is available to
support investigations as required.

At the heart of Mr Bates concerns is his belief that the Horizon system
is in some way corrupt and that Post Office® Ltd are attempting to

Dear Mr Baker

Tam writing to you with regard to Craig-y-don Post Office further to my previous letters.
Post Office Ltd have now closed the office and I have to tell you I am very, very disappointed
with the lack of response to my plea for help and assistance from The National Federation of
Subpostmasters.

The post office ceased trading at 5.30pm, 5“ November 2003 and in the weeks prior to that I
made numerous telephone calls to your office, but to no avail, nobody ever responded. The
file I sent you in mid September about my case highlighted how the issue not only affected
me but also every Subpostmaster who runs a post office. The Horizon system is flawed and
Post Office Ltd are trying to hold Subpostmasters liable for system losses without allowing
full access to the system to check the data they have input.

As The Federation were not able to stand up to Post Office Ltd and support its member is this
issue, it subsequently allowed the Post Office to just take away our investment, livelihood
and life savings in one fell swoop. I have no doubt that Post Office Ltd are involved in a
major cover-up of the inadequacies of the Horizon system and I will continue, even as a voice
alone, to raise the profile of this issue and to have it investigated at the highest level.

Removal of Craig-y-don Post Office from The Wool Post

Your Ref: C2331/41413

Dear Mrs Williams
Thank you for your letter dated 10" November 2003 and the copies of. responses you enclosed.
First I would like to comment on the response to you from Dave Barrett in which he states about

me, “we have been seeking a response from him as to whether he would be selling his business”. 1
have never once been asked this question by anyone at Post Office Ltd.

They did make an approach as to whether or not I would allow another Subpostmaster to continue
ona temporary basis at our premises. But I am sure you can appreciate that when this
‘organisation’ is taking away a major investment of ours as well as our livelihood with the effect
of wiping out our lifesavings, our willingness to help them out of the mess they have created is less
than forthcoming. It just goes to show how little in touch with the real world they are. I would
have gladly carried on providing the Post Office service at our premises until some future date if
they had asked, but they never did. This I would purely have undertaken for the sake of the local
community, not for Post Office Ltd.

The comments made in his letter about “lost confidence” etc., is really just a smokescreen to try
and justify their actions from their position. The real truth behind all this are the problems with
the Post Office Horizon system and the lengths that the Post Office will go to keep it covered up.
If this had not been the case, Post Office Ltd could have answered all my previous letters over the
past three years about liability and access, and we could have moved on. But they realised if they
entered into correspondence on access and liability the real extent of the system problems would
become exposed, so they decided to remove me a different way and are trying to hide behind the
phrase of a contractual issue.

With regard to the response you received from the Minister I can see that the Post Office is using
its ‘contractual issue’ ploy with him again, but he really needs to look into the Horizon issues. It is
Horizon which in one way or another is causing the problems.

My stance since the Horizon system was installed three years ago was that I was unable to accept
liability for system data until such time as I could access the system to check the data I had input.
Ihave yet to find a person who finds that unreasonable, other than the Post Office who have
refused to even recognise my query. There is nothing in the contract between myself and Post

NFSP00001058
NFSP00001058

Office Ltd to say that I should, hence the only way to try remove me was under a clause where
they were not required to give a reason. During the time I had Craig-y-don post Office we had
invested tens of thousands of pounds improving the premises and post office facility and had been
growing business year on year.

Post Office Ltd are terrified about the real facts with Horizon being known and it seems they will
stop at nothing to keep them hidden. I would say now that we are getting into an area that the
Minister should be involved with.

I will offer a recent experience as an example, though as I and others struggle to obtain hard
information or replies, some of the detail may be corrected at a later time. A number of weeks ago
some poor advice received from the Post Office support helpline resulted in £600 relating toa
foreign currency purchase being entered onto the Horizon system wrongly, Over the following
weeks there were a number of telephone calls to and from the Post Office support team trying to
follow through on this incident.

The last phone-call I received from them on this matter was from the Post Office Problem
Management Unit in Barnsley (25 September 2003) when they requested that I print off a report
from the system to enable them to look for the detail of the currency transaction. I was instructed
to install a new till roll in a counter printer and run the printer overni ight, printing off every
transaction from all three till positions for the whole week in which the currency transaction had
happened. The resulting till-rofl was to be sent to them and they would go through the thousands
of transactions on it line by line to try and locate the currency transaction. All this had to happen
relatively quickly as after 30 days all the data is lost from the computer and also there is no way
for their department to access the data at our post office even though the Horizon system is
networked.

So if you now return to my stance about being held liable for data I am unable to check, the fact
that the data is only in existence for 30 days but the liability Post Office Ltd are trying to impose is
timeless. Perhaps you can appreciate why Post Office Ltd refuse to discuss this issue, preferring to
keep it hidden.

This really does need to be investigated at the highest level. I have other examples of problems
and have heard many other stories from Subpostmaster and others. I firmly believe this is only the
tip of an iceberg about the appalling condition of the Horizon system is in, and I am hoping that
my website will encourage others to come forward and document their experiences,

Dear Mrs Williams,

I have been asked to reply to your letter of 22 October 2003, to Allan Leighton
about Craig y Don Post Office® branch temporary closure.

Briefly, we have given notice to Mr Bates, the present subpostmaster, that we

are withdrawing from our contract with him. This is because we have lost

confidence in his willingness to conduct the job in the manner expected. We -
gave the contractual notice period of 3 months, which ends on 5 November

2003. The branch will close for business at 17.30 on 3 November, to enable

us to complete a final audit and decommission the branch the following day

before his contract expires:

It is not our wish to see this branch clgse, and ever since We gave Mr Bates
‘ notice, we:have beeh seeking a:response from him as.to whether he would be
selling his‘business (thus allowing us the opporiuiity t& cdntinué thé service
from the samé location, albeit with 4.new subpostmaster) or if hot whether he
would be willing.to make his, premises.available for a temporary replacement
whilst a permanent appointment could be made. We have a person ready to
step in as a temporary replacement, but it was only this week that Mr Bates
finally informed us he was not willing to allow this to happen.

NFSP00001058

Meantime, we have been advertising for a permanent replacement and
currently have several interested parties with premises in the immediate
vicinity. Unfortunately, it will not be possible for any of them to be in a position
to take over on 5 November, indeed it is unlikely that anyone will do so until
the New Year. But ! am optimistic that we will be able to make an
appointment very soon.

! acknowledge the concems of your constituents about the temporary
withdrawal of service. Indeed several have written directly to us in similar
vein. Please assure them we have been, and are doing, all we can to __

maintain service here and apologise that due to circumstances beyond our
contro] that is not possible. If you personally can bring any pressure to bear
on Mr Bates to allow the temporary use of his premises, I would be grateful as
this would prevent the interruption of service we are facing. Meanwhile, we
are ensuring that facilities and staffing are increased.at the main branch in
Vaughan St to cope with the extra business caused by the Craig y Don
closure.

I will ensure you are informed when a permanent appointment is made, as we
will be consulting about the change in premises. Meantime, please let me
know if I can help further.

Dear Mr Baker

I have enclosed a detailed file of a dispute I am engaged in with Post Office Limited
regarding accessibility and liability of the data held by the Horizon system. This affects all
Federation members and because I have taken a stand on it, Post Office Limited are trying to
take my livelihood away.

Whether it takes 1 month, 1 year or 10 years I will continue to fight Post Office Limited on
this issue. The website referred to is turning into a far bigger package than was originally
envisaged, and when it is launched shortly it will bring the issue into the national arena.

Put simply, Post Office Limited are trying to alter the terms of the contract to make me (and
all Subpostmasters) liable for unlimited Horizon system losses without the right to access and
check the data I have put in the system. The accompanying documentation spells it all out
quite clearly, Post Office Limited will not actually address the core item relating to the issue
and the legal advice I have been given is that they will not do so because ‘they do not have a
leg to stand on’ as I am in full compliance of my contact.

Regarding the file enclosed, the notes accompanying the letter to Allen Leighton lists in
chronological order the majority of the documentation. The letter to Philip Green of Capita
Assistance on 6" September 2003 does the same to the rest the correspondence.

There is a local branch Federation meeting at the end of this month at which John Peberdy
will be present and before the meeting date I will bring Dave Foster, the Branch Secretary, up
to speed. At that meeting I am intending to hand out leaflets summarising the dispute to all
members attending.

In writing to you and making you aware of this issue I would very much appreciate the
support of the Federation in at least the following way. That is to ask all Federation members

to not support Post Office Limited by operating my office. As I mentioned earlier I will fight
for the return of my office and to recover my investment, regardless of the time it will take.

Dear Mr Bates

Thank you for your letter of 7 January 2002 concerning the difficulties you have
experienced which appear to be linked to the Horizon migration process.

I am sure that it is time that the matter was resolved and.I trust that it will not be long
now before the amounts can be removed from the Suspense Account.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance, although I am sure that David
Foster will render every assistance possible. : ;

Yours sincerely

For information I have enclosed some documents relating to Horizon and losses over a period

of a few weeks when the system was upgraded in 2000

T have been keeping David Foster, the Gwynedd Branch Secretary fully informed on the
matter, but my letter dated 7" January 2002 to Post Office Limited is meant to clear out the

matter one way or another.

1 am not expecting your office to take any action at the moment but I thought it advisable to

at least forward you copies of my correspondence.

Dear Mr Chester

As you are aware the cash account for this office is still showing an amount of
£1041.86 in the suspense account, This cumulative figure was placed in the suspense
account towards the end of 2000 and I have on doubt at all that it was due to errors in
the Horizon system over a number of weeks at that time. In my letters to Gerry Hayes
dated 19" December 2000 and 16" July 2001, neither of which did I receive a written
reply to, I gave further details on this matter.

Ireally do think that enough time has now passed for Post Office Limited to have
resolved this issue and that unless J receive a written comment to the contrary by the
end of this month I will take it that this matter is closed. When I signed my contract
with Post Office Counters I did not sign to accept the liabilities arising from the
shortcomings of a less than adequate Horizon system, all liabilities from such a
system are clearly the responsibility of Post Office Limited or ICL Pathway.

Allowing this issue to drag on not only continues the stress and strain of the original
problems but I fear also continually casts doubt over my honesty and that of my staff.

Therefore I would greatly appreciate it if you would bring this matter to a head in
order that we can move on,

Your sincerely

Dear Gerry

In reply to your letter dated 16" July 2001 I would like to draw your attention to the
letter I sent you on the 19" December 2000. It related the problems with Horizon
which I believe led to the losses at that time.

As I have said to you and every other person that has ever visited with regard to the
problems with the Horizon system, it is nigh on impossible to access the data I as a
subpostmaster need in order to track problems or accept responsibility for the
processing through this office. It is not that the data is not within the system, and it is
not that Chesterfield can access this data in many other ways, But I as a front line user
need to be given the tools, such as a report writer package which can access files on a
read only basis, to enable me to look for problems, duplications or errors, easily and
effectively, The alternative, and this seems to be the essence of your letter, is that I
should subsidise the shortcomings of this system.

I hope this clarifies my position and answers your letter.

Yours sincerely

Reference: Horizon Faults

Dear Mr Hayes

Further to our telephone conversation on the morning of Thursday 14th December
after the problems with our balance the previous day, I thought it prudent to confirm
the details to you in writing.

The balance at this office on the Wednesday the 13 December was not only very
stressful but also very worrying. The evidence that appeared during that day proved
beyond any doubt that the Horizon system cannot be relied upon to give 100%
accurate figures. The problem which was highlighted to this office that day was with
regard to Giro Deposits and at one point the weekly returns were showing a variance,
to the addition of the daily returns, of over £6000.

The whole of that afternoon was spent making a number of phone calls to the
different helplines, one of almost 1 hour long, and kept two of the three terminals
producing nothing but reports, at a peak trading time when we had queues out of the
door; though eventually I did manage to track down the majority of the money. That
said the cash account for that week is still showing a shortage of £1182.81. Ican
without any doubt attribute £368.50 of that to Giro items that have been double
entered and that I am unable to track because of the way Horizon is set up, Of the
remaining £814.31 shortage, I am presuming that £409.15 of that is the shortage from
the previous week that has become added to the total. This leaves a difference
£405.16 which I am unsure of where it comes from. It may well be a Giro system
error as might be the previous weeks £409.15 shortage or it may be something else.
Unfortunately the current Horizon system does not let you access previous
transactions adequately enough to track problems with shorts or overs at the end of
the week.

Having spoken to the local Branch Secretary of the Federation of Subpostmasters on
these problems and realising the problems I am experiencing are being found by
others around the country I really do believe it would be unreasonable for Post Office
Network to hold me liable for losses on the cash account until such time as 100%
guarantee can be given about the accuracy of Horizon.

Thad been hoping to leave any comments in writing about Horizon until the Office is
quieter in January and then write a detailed submission about the cost we have
incurred with it (around £1000), the problems with the counter (staff working with
money and stamp books on chairs or on the shelf behind them), the very poor layout

of the screen and menus, the slowness of the printers, the lack of report writing
facilities, the chaotic end of day and end of week procedures and the problems of
having to do ‘office work’ at a terminal on the counter. Given time I shall produce
the report for you,

Please do not think that I am being nothing but negative about the system, I am a firm
believer in the way forward being through such a system. But bear in mind my
comments are made by someone who has had considerable experience of EPOS
systems before joining the Post Office in 1998, 1 first began working with them in
1986 and have used a variety of systems, I have been involved with running an
assessment program on one system and have developed and implemented a large site
specific package with a software development company. So I do have some insight
into these systems and I would gladly be willing to offer constructive feedback if
asked.

With regard to the current deficit showing on our cash account for last week how do
you want me to progress this week’s balance? Should I just roll it through and see
what happens, or what?

I would be very grateful for any guidance or assistance you can offer on this matter.

Your sincerely

Alan Bates
