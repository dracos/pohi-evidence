Thanks Tom. Interesting that I hadn't even thought about it until I saw the team yesterday when I was seeing Jane.
(Apparently SS suggested to Tim that they might do some work for him/us, tidying up the unresolved cases...!!!!)

Avene, BF 121 Jane.

I commissioned a quick update on Sparrow o/r as we should be entering the final stages (at least
formally).

Attached is a two page brief. Headlines I would pick out are:

¢  <!-[if !supportLists]--><![endif]->9 mediations remain to be completed

e = <!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->The resolution rate at mediation is 52%

e = <!--[if lsupportLists]--><![endif]-->it does not look like we are any closer to litigation

e  <!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->The QC’s review is due to complete in the next week or so for
Tim’s consideration

e  <!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->The team is effectively in wind-down mode

Hope this is helpful

Tom
