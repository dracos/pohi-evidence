Bugs table — recovery
issues (row 8)

acha959T

Ifa TI recovery request times out at the counter, recovery is abandoned and no second attempt is made to
get the recovery information. This is as designed; it was decided to keep recovery simple and not have too
many error paths. The priority is to get the User working again, so in this sort of error path we just mark
the recovery as failed and leave it for SSC to sort out

Bugs table — reversals
(row 9)

PSteed2847N (2003) Remming issue but error notices, rather than TCs, at the time. Obvious
DEA failure.
(I said TC - should have said error notice)

Bugs table — data tree
build (row 10)

MScardifield2219S says ‘nothing gets lost in the end’ ‘ the declare cash problem clears itself
overnight’ (2007) — but is much later and probably not connected to the 2000 incident.

F/22 PCO033128 (Dungannon) ‘immediate impact of this week’s balance has been
addressed’; ‘seen as a one off’; error trapping introduced. Then Yate Sodbury £52K, Appleby
£9K; appeared fixed by July 2000 — so why the much later Peak?

Coyne 3.109 says other Peaks are ‘likely related’ but there is no analysis in his table to
support this.

© F/29 PC0046811 June 2000 RP mismatch £37.40 — not clear what the link is
between the two Peaks. No mention of data trees, or Riposte.

© — F/66 PCO055964 Oct 2000 RP mismatch. No mention of data trees. No Riposte
fault.

© F/76 PCO0S8161 Nov 2000 another RP mismatch, £3K. No mention of data trees.
Riposte system calls failing with no error logged.

Coyne could be asked — how are the Peaks he cites in row 10 of
the table JS2 related to data tree build? I have found no
obvious relation.

He seems just to have picked up three RP mismatch Peaks in
2000, which were fairly common in 2000-2001

The KEL from 2005-2007. Mentions a possible Riposte failure,
but no mention of data trees

POL00028953
POL00028953

Next Peak cited is 2006, PC0132133 and references the KEL. Mentions data trees, but not
data tree build problems — and nobody made a link to the earlier problem.

Conclusion: my estimate of £10K financial impact was conservative

Withdrawn stock (row
13)

Although I included this in my table of possible bugs (for impact assessment), my opinion in
the bugs table was that it had no lasting effect. This was based on my previous analysis of
the KEL (some possible impact) and FJ’s analysis of the same KEL (no impact).

I was being conservative to include it in the table.

Bureau Discrepancies

F/1679 PCO261541 2017 £200 shortfall from FX. Comms failure during tx.

03 KELs and Peaks together form a useful source of information about bugs in
Horizon but are a limited window on what happened. It is sometimes
necessary to use evidence from both to try to understand, but even so they
are not a comprehensive picture. It is to be expected that both KELs and
Peaks are incomplete in various respects.

1.7 agreed

RP mismatches evident to SPM

Possible line for Coyne XX:

JS2 1.7 talks about Receipts payments mismatches

1.7 makes it clear that it was not just the one bug — but it
happened more frequently?

As in some of the Peaks you have cited? (examples above — bugs
table row 10)

Generally , if an RP mismatch happened, it was not the SPM’s
fault?

It was some system issue?

You have agreed in 1.7 than any RP mismatch is evident to the
SPM?

So it is evident to him , and he knows it is not his fault?

He can see the size of the discrepancy? (in his reports — trial
balance)

So in these cases, he is likely to call the help line? (which
probably leads to a Peak)

And — knowing it is not his fault — he is unlikely to stop calling
until the issue is resolved?

Until he knows the discrepancy has no adverse impact on his
accounts?

In other words, if ever there is an RP mismatch (especially a large
one), the branch is very likely to have been compensated for any
discrepancy?

So these Peaks are not really evidence of lasting discrepancies in
branch accounts?

1.9 agreed to disagree

Definition of branch impact

Coyne’s definition is pretty meaningless — could XX.

If asked: why so much RW here? Apologise if I got it wrong. We tried to do better in later JS. The low level of agreement in JS2 arose partly from our very
different approaches to Horizon Issue 1.

(One of the purposes of a joint statement may be to ensure a level playing field - that neither expert gets a ‘last word’, giving the other expert no chance to

reply. Coyne 2 gave him a last word on RW1; I had no last word on Coyne 1. The JS were a level playing field. Coyne could have come back on the RW points.
Needs to be used carefully.)

The overall balance of RW and JC points in JS2,3,4 is not that far from even.

There are four main areas within the Horizon Architecture:
1. POL-FS — financial accounting system based on SAP

2. Reference Data Proving — environment in which changes to reference data are proved
before releasing into live (reference data controls things such as which products are
sold, their price and where in the menu hierarchy they are displayed).

3. Branches — the branches themselves

4. Core Horizon — the central systems that support Horizon

10.10 JC

The modification from a TRT could provide an erroneous view of a branches’
accounting position and therefore Post Office could potentially issue a
Transaction Correction to a branch in error.

Does this not apply to any change at all made in a back end system, or
a POL system?
Was not the main purpose of the TRT to repair something that had
gone wrong?
Typically the ‘mode ‘ of a transaction - not the amount? (cite Peaks)
So the chances of that repair itself going wrong are a second-order
effect?
And the chances of that getting back into branch accounts
undetected are third-order effect?
Avery remote possibility?
And you have made no attempt yourself to estimate the frequency
with which this third-order effect might happen?
Whereas RW has at least made an estimate of the financial impact of
incorrect TCs?
Which, given what you say here, is a relevant thing to do?
And you have not contested his estimate?
Do you not think that , by dragging in such a remote possibility of a
third order impact on branch accounts:
© You are allowing yourself to draw in such a wide range of
events as to make your conclusions almost meaningless —
including almost anything that might go wrong in the back
end, or in POL?
© You are diluting the concept of ‘remote access’ out of any
real meaning?
© You are attempting to give an impression that problems
may have been more widespread than they actually were —
i.e being biased?
© Does this really assist the court?

Uncommon types of repair —

Therefore, it is usually difficult for the experts to make categorical negative
statements of the form: ‘x or Y never happened’.

You have agreed that it is rather difficult to make a negative
statement like ‘X or Y never happened’?

So a statement of the form ‘X or Y might have happened’ is rather
empty? Obvious? Like ‘bugs could occur’?

You have agreed that these are rather empty, obvious statements?

‘The TIP Transaction Repair Tool is an ORACLE Forms application that runs on the TPS workstation.
SSC uses it to correct records that were rejected when the Branch Database tried to load them into the
