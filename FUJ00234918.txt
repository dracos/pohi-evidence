SECURITY

Introduction

This section covers the security provisions relating to the HNG-X Service Infrastructure.

Encryption Key Management

2.2.1 The HNG-X System shall support a reliable and secure means for the transfer of
data to the Data Centre. This shall include the use of techniques used selectively
and in agreement between Post Office and Fujitsu Services as specified in the
CCD entitled "HNG-X Technical Security Architecture" (ARC/SEC/ARC/0003)

2.2.2 With the exception of PIN Pads (in which case paragraph 2.1.4 of Schedule B3.4
shall apply), a key management system shall be in place so the encrypted data
can be deciphered without risk of that cryptographic key being exposed.

2.2.3 Fujitsu Services shall support the use of PIN Pads and the associated
cryptographic management. PIN Pads shall comply with the requirements of ISO
9564.

BUSINESS CONTINUITY

Introduction

This paragraph 3 covers the business continuity provisions relating to the HNG-X Service
Infrastructure.

End to End Recovery

End-to-end recovery shall be performed by Fujitsu Services in accordance with the CCD
entitled “HNG-X Business Continuity Framework” (SVM/SDM/SIP/0001).

Business Continuity

3.3.1 Data Centre Resilience

Schedule B3.3 Version 15.0
Page 7 of 10

FUJ00234918
FUJ00234918
CONFIDENTIAL

(a)

(c)

One Data Centre will be used to support the Business Capabilities and
Support Facilities (the “Live Data Centre”) with a second Data Centre
providing DR (the “DR Data Centre”). There are network components
(appliances and platforms) at the DR Data Centre which contribute to
the provision of Business Capabilities and Support Facilities.

The DR Data Centre will under normal operation be used for testing
except where it needs to be used for business continuity tests. The DR
Data Centre will also host some live network components.

Each Data Centre shall have the capability in normal operation with no
failures or a single failure having occurred:

(i) to support the Contracted Volumes as defined in the CCD
entitled "Horizon Capacity Management and Business Volumes”
(PA/PER/033); and

(ii) to support Fujitsu Services’ obligations in respect of Service
Levels set out in Schedule C1 and each applicable Service
Description.

Each Data Centre will be configured such that the failure of a single
component will not cause the Business Capabilities and Support
Facilities to fail. For the avoidance of doubt, Fujitsu Services will inform
Post Office of those major Data Centre components whose failure may
result in the need to invoke DR. There is a single high capacity WAN
circuit into each Data Centre. Should the link into one Data Centre fail
then a patch via the other Data Centre will be used.

Switchover to backup systems within the Data Centre and for the
network connections within the Data Centre:

(i) for real-time elements of the Business Capabilities and Support
Facilities shall be automated; and

(ii) for non-real time elements may be automated or manual.

Switchover from the Live Data Centre to the DR Data Centre will be
manually initiated.

In the event that the DR Data Centre needs to be used to run the live
service or if the DR Data Centre itself is unavailable, there will be no
significant test environment available. In this scenario, limited testing
(sufficient to test minor fixes needed to keep the live service operational)
will be available at a Fujitsu Services development site. However such
testing facilities will not be sufficient to test releases.

3.3.2 The Central Network

Schedule B3.3 Version 15.0

Page 8 of 10

FUJ00234918
FUJ00234918
CONFIDENTIAL

(a)

The Central Network comprises the network communications between
the Data Centres and the switches used by Fujitsu Services (or Fujitsu
Services’ Sub-contractor which operates such network) to:

(i) Until November 15'* January 2018, answer ISDN calls from
Branches;
(ii) convert asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) communications
from ADSL Branches into internet protocol (IP) communications;
or

(iii) convert leased line communications from Branches into internet
protocol (IP) communications

(iv) convert wireless wide area network (WAN) protocols from
Branches into internet protocol (IP) communications,

(the "Central Network").

The loss of a major sub-contractor network switching node within the
Central Network shall not cause the complete loss of the Branch
Telecom Infrastructure. However, should a loss of a major sub-
contractor network switching node within the Central Network occur,
Fujitsu Services (in addition to its other obligations under this
Agreement) shall use all reasonable endeavours to procure that any
shortfall in system performance is recovered within seven days of that
loss.

The Central Network shall be configured such that there shall be no
single point of failure within the Central Network. Some failures in the
Central Network may require the Branch to re-establish communications
with the Data Centre.

3.3.3 The Santander Circuit

(a)

The Santander Circuit shall be configured such that there shall be no
single point of failure (including site failure) within the Santander Circuit.

"The Santander Circuit shall have the capability in normal operation, with
no failures or a single failure having occurred to that link:”

(i) to support the Contracted Volumes for Banking Transactions for
Santander as defined in the CCD entitled "Horizon Capacity
Management and Business Volumes” (PA/PER/033); and

(ii) of supporting Fujitsu Services’ obligations in respect of Service
Levels set out in Schedule C1 and each applicable Service
Description.
