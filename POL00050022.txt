REGINA v JANET LOUISE SKINNER
HULL CROWN COURT - 29™ AUGUST 2008
CASE NO: POLTD/0607/0108

Patricia Docherty of Counsel attended for the prosecution in this case. The
Defendant also attended represented:

The Defendant having complied with the terms of the Order made on the 1*
July 2008 the Court varied the Order. Accordingly the recoverable amount
on the Order was reduced to £1,470,65 being the sum recovered from the
Defendant following the sale of her property. The benefit of £59,175.39
remains. This means that should the Defendant come into money within
the next 6 years Royal Mail can apply to the Court to vary the recoverable
amount under the Order.

I shall write to the Sheffield Magistrates Court informing them of the above
as I understand that enforcement proceedings had commenced.
