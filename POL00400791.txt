Version: 6.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 08-Aug-03

1.0 Introduction

1.1 Purpose

This Access Control Policy (ACP) defines the policy for controlling access to resources in the
Horizon system.

Effective control depends on:

e Understanding the information in the system and what access to it should be permitted,
and where it is vulnerable;

e Having a clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of all personnel who need some
form of access to the system;

e Setting access policies and controls to provide the required access while countering the
threats and vulnerabilities.

1.2 Context

This document fits into the structure of documents for Post Office Accounts security as
illustrated in figure 1-1 below.

The ACP defines the policies for controlling access to the Post Office Account IT system in
compliance with the Post Office Account Security Policy.

The Security Functional Specification (SFS) defines the security functionality that is
incorporated into the Horizon system.

The Technical Environment Description (TED) describes the architecture and technical
environment for the Post Office Account solution.

Controlling access to IT resources requires a combination of physical controls and manual
procedures as well as controls in the IT system. Other documents define related policies,

POL00400791

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 08-Aug-03

procedures and processes, for example, for physical security of information (including the
procedures for entering a site and safeguarding manual records) as well as procedures for
using the system and handling security incidents. Other documents define how the various
Post Office Account components are configured.

1.3 Effect on other Post Office Account Standards and
Procedures

This Access Control Policy defines the policy for controlling access to resources in the
operational Horizon system. As explained in section 1.2, other documents give more details
of the technical solution and the associated policies and procedures. The effect of the Access
Control Policy on these other documents is:

13.11 Configuration documents should define how systems are configured to conform to
the ACP, for example, how the roles defined in the ACP are set up to restrict
access as required.

1.3.1.2 The roles defined in the ACP should be used in other standards and procedures,
not just information system controls. For example:

e where a role requires access to sensitive data, this should be reflected in the level
of vetting required for staff in that role;

e users in these roles must be formally registered and authorised to take that role by
the appropriate authority before being added to the IT system. Records of all
persons registered to use the system must be kept, though the way this is done
may be role or service dependent.

1.3.1.3. Where physical security and/or procedures are required to complement the IT
controls to provide the required level of access control, such procedures need to
conform to the ACP.

1.3.14 The Post Office Account Security Manager will satisfy himself that the
procedures at the various Outlets are in compliance with the Post Office Account
security policies and specifications.

1.4 Scope and Document Structure

This Access Control Policy defines how access to information system resources is controlled
in the Post Office Account solution. It covers the Post Office Account Data Centre systems;
Post Office Account managed systems such as interface systems at Post Office Ltd. Outlets
and closely related Post Office Account project systems. Access may be the result of direct
user action, or automatically initiated activities.

The ACP contains:

e An outline of the services, the roles of the people and the Outlets used in the Post Office
Account solution (Chapter 2);

e The access control policies for the whole of Post Office Account, covering policies for
authentication, information access within systems, system set-up and network access ete
(Chapter 3);

¢ Specific access controls for human users - where the policies in Chapter 3 are specialised
for particular user roles or there are exceptions to the general policies (Chapter 4);

e Specific access controls for particular systems - specialisation and exceptions to the
policies in Chapter 3 (Chapter 5);

e A complete list of Post Office Account human roles and an overview of the IT access
permitted to each of these (Chapter 6).

This document specifies access control policies, not detailed procedures for configuring and
running these systems.

Separate internal Post Office Account documents also cover system development and test
systems and other activities prior to the handing over of the software for operational use.

1.5 Access Control Policy Review

This document will be formally reviewed at least annually. It will also be reviewed where
relevant after a significant security incident, as part of a more general security policy review,
and updated whenever necessary.

Responsibilities for approval, review and issue of this document will conform to the review
procedure for Post Office Account policy and standards defined in the Post Office Account
Security Policy.

2.0 Outline of Services, Roles and Outlets

The Horizon system can be described from different views as follows:

e The operational systems and their business users.

e The business management users of the system, including security and auditing.
¢ Outlet Business Change used during the introduction of new Post Office outlets.

e System & operational management and support.

This chapter gives an outline of the people and systems involved as a context for the policies
and roles described later. It is not intended as a complete description of the system - for that,
see [TED].

2.1.1 Services, Systems and Interactions

Information is sent from Post Office Ltd. (reference data) and Post Office Ltd. clients (APS
information from Post Office Ltd. clients) to the Post Office Account Data Centres. Most of
this data is also forwarded to relevant Post Office outlets for use by applications there.
Transactions at the Post Office outlets are recorded at the correspondence servers and
forwarded to Post Office Ltd. and/or other Post Office Ltd. clients as relevant. NBS on-line
transaction data is exchanged with the NBE via dedicated NB Agents over an encrypted link.

POL00400791

Fujitsu Services Access Control Policy Ref: RS/POL/003
Version: 6.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 08-Aug-03

At the Data Centres the main applications are on Sequent/UNIX systems but the agents and
correspondence servers which handle distribution of information to and from the Post Office
outlets are on NT servers, as are most of the supporting systems such as the key management
systems. Post Office Systems are also NT.

Apart from at the Post Office outlets, all activities are automated in normal circumstances, so
there are no business users.

2.1.2 Roles

At the Post Office counters, operational roles are the Post Office Manager, Supervisor and
Counter Clerk. There are equivalent roles in franchises and Sub Post Office outlets i.e. Sub
Postmasters and their staff.

2.2. Business/Corporate Management
Post Office Account corporate management users and the systems they use are shown in the

2.2.1 Services and Systems

Corporate management services provide analysis and reporting of management information
on Post Office Account’s operation of the Horizon system. Systems include:

e A Data warehouse (Sequent system) which takes input from many Post Office Account
and related systems (including Royal Mail information about card distribution and BT &
Mitel information about help desk calls).

¢ Related MIS systems, including a financial system at a separate site.

The Data warehouse/MIS systems at the Data Centre support a number of services including
Contract Management, Reconciliation and Accounting and Asset Management.

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 08-Aug-03

CS Management Service users access use aggregated information stored within the Data
Warehouse to assist in reporting on the operational system, accounting and monitoring of
service levels. Access is via the SMDB, which is placed in a DMZ formed by the use of two
separate firewalls. Authentication to the Webserver on the SMDB is by username and
password.

There are also Security Specific Services including an Authentication Service for security
token users and key management services. Keys are installed at the Data Centre and also at
interface PC’s at other sites.

2.2.2 Roles

The main roles are:

e A range of Post Office Account corporate management roles e.g. financial management,
contract management and associated support roles.

e A number of Post Office Account customer service roles such as Management Support
which assist business operations such as financial reconciliation of payments and
Reference Data roles for maintaining reference data.

e Post Office Account Security Management, which manages security tokens for Post
Office Account users. This includes the Post Office Account Cryptographic Key
Manager who is responsible for generating and distributing all cryptographic keys used in
Post Office Account to protect communications links, digitally sign information and
encrypt filestores at Post Office Outlets.
The Key Manager will delegate some responsibility for installing and updating keys to
Post Office Account Cryptographic Key Custodians and Cryptographic Key Handlers.

e Post Office Account Prosecution Support, which provides system data and associated
information in support of investigations and litigation activities undertaken by or on
behalf of Post Office Ltd.

e Post Office Account Auditors: both a Business Function Auditor responsible for general
auditing of the Horizon system (focusing on business, rather than security, auditing) and a
Security Event Auditor responsible for auditing all use of the Horizon systems. Both
types of auditor access information on the Horizon system.

e Post Office Ltd. Auditors, Investigators and Emergency Managers who can access
services at Post Office outlets.

Post Office Ltd. and NAO Auditors also have indirect access to audit information at the
Data Centres. This is via Post Office Account Auditors, rather than direct access to the
Horizon system.

2.3 Outlet Business Change

2.3.1 Services and Systems

The OCMS database contains information about Post Office outlets where Horizon is to be
implemented or withdrawn, for example, Post Office details, the state of the site ete.

Configuration information comes mainly from the auto-configuration system and is used in
the initial set-up or in respect of decommissioning activities of Post Office outlets, updating
the generic set-up of the counter systems as delivered. The auto-configuration process is very
largely automated.

2.3.2, Roles

The main roles here are:

e The Help Desk;

e Outlet Business Change Team;

e The staff responsible for auto-configuration, who may need to amend information in
certain circumstances.

In addition, there are Outlet Business Change suppliers who are responsible for site surveys,
installation ete (who use bulk transfer, not interactive access to the OCMS database) and the
people who set-up and verify the counter terminals in the factory.

2.4.1 Services and Interactions

System and operational management and support users manage and support Post Office
outlets, systems at the Data Centre (including routers and firewalls) and Post Office Account
managed systems such as the interface PCs at Post Office Ltd.

The help desk handles all technical calls from Post Office Ltd. and other Post Office
Account users including those from the Post Office requiring key and password recovery
services.

Post Office Account project sites include a Configuration Management system that enables
software to be distributed to the Horizon systems, including Post Office outlets. There are
also test rigs used by application support staff for detecting and fixing bugs.

The technical help desk and system/operational management and support staff also use
internal Post Office Account/Fujitsu Services support tools such as the Powerhelp and
Problem Management systems for recording, progressing and monitoring calls to the help
desk.

Note that many of the system and operational management and support staff are remote from
the systems being managed.

2.4.2 Roles

The main roles are as follows:

Version: 6.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 08-Aug-03

e Operational Management (sometimes called System Administration): keeping the system
running where this is not carried out by system management. Operational management is
normally split into sub-roles, including:

— System set-up and installation: setting up the base and application software on the
system and configuring it for live running, including roles.

— Software update, where this is not automated via system management.

— Security/User administration: administering user security information such as their
authentication information, the roles they can perform and the groups to which they
belong.

— Database (e.g. Oracle) or Package (e.g. Riposte) administration.

— Computer operator: on most systems, this is a minimal role - switching on machines,
loading media and similar operations.

— Other system administration functions.

Note that some package administration is done by people supporting the application
users e.g. Discoverer and Business Objects are administered by corporate
management support staff.

e System Management: monitoring events and resources in the operational system and
taking appropriate action to rectify problems. Also, distributing software (complete new
packages or patches), where this is automated, for example, at the Post Office outlets.
Sub-roles for operational management separate specific roles and also separate
administration of users and the Tivoli system itself.

e Network Management: managing the network, including routers and firewalls, which
connect machines and Outlets.

e Application support; 2nd, 3rd and 4th line.
e Other hardware and system support.
e Horizon System and other technical help desks and supporting staff.

e Engineers.

2.5 Post Office Account Sites and Interactions

The main Horizon services run at the secure Post Office Account Data Centres. This includes
primary operational systems, most corporate management systems, some Outlet Business
Change and system & network management systems as outlined in previous sections.

The main operational and management services can be run at either site, if needed, though
there is a prime site for each. Figure 2-5 shows the sites with electronic links to the Post
Office Account Data Centres.

Figure 2.5 Post Office Account Data Centres and linked Outlets

All links to the Data Centres are protected by routers, firewalls and DMZs, cryptographic
boxes or VPN (or a combination of these) depending on the requirements protecting each
type of link and the data that travels over it. Routers and firewalls are also used to separate
Data Centre systems in some cases.

Where Post Office Account communicates with other organisation’s sites (such as Post
Office Ltd.), Post Office Account manages the interface PC/router at that site to provide a
gateway between Post Office Account and that organisation’s systems.

The main Post Office Account project sites that have access to the Data Centre systems have
secure LANs for that access with an encrypted link to the Data Centre. Where people at these
sites access other systems, including other sites, there are separate networks. At some Post
Office Account project sites there are more complex networks which permit limited traffic
to/from other controlled systems (e.g. for software distribution from the Configuration
Management systems and for downloading of data to test rigs for investigating faults). In
these cases, firewalls are used at the project sites to control this traffic.

There are a number of other support and Outlet Business Change sites with different types of
access. These are subject to different access control policies as appropriate for the site.

3.0 Overall Access Control Policies

This chapter identifies the overall access control policies and associated procedures and
controls that apply across the Horizon solution. It outlines the general policies that apply
across systems and identifies where variants and exceptions are permitted. In these cases, the
exceptions are defined in the appropriate sub-section of chapters 4 and 5 below. No other
variants are permitted.

3.1 Introduction

The objectives in the Post Office Account Security Policy give the requirements for
confidentiality and integrity of data, whether in storage or in transit, and integrity of the
services and software components. The ACP defines the policies for controlling access in line
with these objectives.

3.1.1 Post Office Account Human Roles

Human access to the Post Office Account information systems is specified in terms of roles.
People in specified roles are permitted to carry out defined functions and access specified
data. This is normally monitored by controls within the information systems, though in some
cases, manual procedures are used to supplement these.

Post Office Account controls the roles people are allowed to perform, and which functions
they are allowed to carry out. Users are individually identified so that they can be made
accountable for their actions.

Where practical, the same or similar roles are defined for several systems to reduce
complexity and make it easier to check compliance with the overall security policy.

The Access Control Policy includes all roles for users who have direct access to the Horizon
operational systems and the related systems at the Data Centres. In addition, this document
includes a limited number of user roles that enable others to use the system on their behalf
(e.g. in response to a phone call).

Roles are normally associated with major functions. Defining separate roles allows different
functions to be allocated to different individuals. However, the actual allocation of roles to
individuals is done by administrative action. Some users may be permitted to carry out more
than one major function, so are permitted to take more than one “role”. This is not permitted
in cases where security may be undermined.

3.1.2 Types of Information and its Use

Information in the Horizon system that requires protection from unauthorised access
includes:

e The business data exchanged with Post Office Ltd. and its clients (e.g. reference data to
support EPOSS and transaction data resulting from Post Office counter activities.)
Business data is transferred between Post Office Ltd., Post Office Ltd. Clients and the
Post Office Account Data Centres and between the Data Centres and the Post Office

outlets. It is stored at the main operation systems and also in archives. Some data is also
available for management services at the Data Warehouse and accessed via the SMDB.

Post Office Account business management data - financials, service level agreements etc.
Confidentiality and integrity requirements exist for much of this data. The Management
Information System collects this data from the operational systems. This is then
forwarded as appropriate to Post Office Account sites, Post Office Ltd. and their Clients.

Other data supporting the business processes such as training data (special, non-sensitive,
business style data used in training sessions) and on-line documentation (e.g. Post Office
procedures.)

Operational systems data such as the software, configuration information, Tivoli scripts,
system management event logs etc. This information is held mainly at the Data Centre
and accessed remotely from system management and support sites.

Security information about users, keys, security audit logs etc.

Most processing of the business information, except at the Post Office Outlet, is automated
and therefore not subject to human access. Most processing of system data is also automated.

All information is protected in compliance with the Security Functional Specification and
Post Office Account Security Policy.

3.2 General Principles

The following general principles should be followed in controlling access to the Horizon
systems.

3.2.1.1 The principle of “least privilege” must apply to restrict the access rights of users.

(This may be applied through a mixture of technical and procedural controls.)

3.2.1.2 Duties of different users should be separated to minimise the damage that any one

3.

user can do to the system or the information it contains.

If a role at a particular location is allocated to a single person there should
generally be at least one other person who can deputise for that person. (At small
Post Office outlets where no deputy is available, and the Post Office Manager is
unavailable, the Post Office Outlet will not open until emergency procedures have
been invoked.)

3.2.1.4 I Where possible, Post Office Account operations are automated to reduce the need

for human intervention and the potential accidental and malicious security
breaches that could result from human activity. E.g. applications should be
designed to reduce the dependence on human interaction and jobs should be
scheduled automatically in response to the receipt of files or at a particular time.

3.2.1.5. Similarly, where practical, system management tasks should be automated. This
includes taking remedial action where the results of monitoring the system show
this is needed. Only where action cannot be taken automatically, or human
verification of an action is needed, should human intervention be required.

Note that this document covers access by system entities as well as human users, but does not
define roles for them.

3.3. Human Access

This section contains the policies for how human access to the Horizon systems is controlled.
It is divided into sub-section for policies on:

e Authentication to prove the user’s identity to the IT system, and hence the user’s right to
take on a particular role and access particular resources.

e User registration/ administration to establish and maintain the user’s identity and security
attributes (i.e. role, password, etc).

e Authentication of visitors.
e Authentication by telephone.

¢ Control of human access to resources (see also 3.5).

3.3.1 Authentication to IT Systems

3.3.1.1 All users must be authenticated to IT systems. This authentication must identify
them as individuals. (The few permitted exceptions to this policy are in Chapter
4).

3.3.1.2 People accessing Horizon systems are required to identify themselves using hand
held tokens if:

e They are at sites remote from the Data Centre and can update operational or MIS
systems (for example, to perform systems management actions).

e They can access Post Office Ltd. business data (except at Post Office outlets).

e They are authorised to update system data that can affect the running of the
Horizon systems. This includes roles that have UNIX root privilege, NT users
belonging to the administrator’s group and database administrators.

Where such tokens are used for authentication, the associated PIN must be at least
6 characters long.

3.3.1.4 Each user must have an individually allocated token except in emergencies, e.g.
when a token is lost. In such cases, specific authentication will be agreed.

3.3.1.5 Where a user needs to authenticate to multiple systems/domains in one session,
the first authentication (normally to the local workstation) should be with a token.

3.3.1.6

3.3.1.8

3.3.1.9

3.3.1.10

3.3.1.13

If a user who authenticates with a token to one system/domain needs to perform
an additional authentication to another system, the second authentication should
also be a token based one, using the same token. Agreed exceptions to this must
be documented.

Where passwords are used for authentication, the user should be forced to change
the initial password before any other access to the system is permitted.

Passwords must expire in 30 days unless otherwise stated (in the section on the
appropriate domain).

Re-use of the same password is not permitted for either a specified time or until at
least 3 other passwords have been used.

Passwords must be a minimum of 6 characters long and be alphanumeric (i.e. a
mix of letters and numbers). There cannot be more than two consecutive identical
characters. The password cannot be the same as the username.

After 3 consecutive unsuccessful attempts to log-on, the user should be locked out
unless otherwise stated.

Users are authenticated with their individual usernames on first access to the
system. A change to use another username will only be permitted to certain
authorised operational management roles in exceptional circumstances as
specified in this document (e.g. for Sequent systems in 4.2.2). Any change to use
another username must be controlled and audited in a way that is always recorded.

In limited circumstances an operational management role may need full system
administrator access. In these cases, where possible, the user should be given
limited privileges on log-on with additional privileges being subject to further
authorisation. In particular, no user will be allowed to log onto UNIX with root
access (though some may be permitted a controlled change to root access later).

3.3.2 User Registration and Administration

3.3.2.1

People must be identified to Post Office Account information system as
individuals. Users with direct access to the system should be registered as follows:

If accessing the system via a package such as Oracle or Tivoli, they are registered
with that package.

Users who require direct access to the operating system are registered with that
operating system (at the local system or NT domain)

Users requiring token authentication are also registered with the appropriate
authentication service.

(The only exceptions allowed to this are the specific cases identified in later sections of this
document. In these limited exceptional cases, the user, (e.g. an engineer) is identified as an

individual using manual means prior to using the system in a way specially set up for this,
and where the use of the system is suitably monitored.)

3.3.3 Authentication of Visitors to Post Office outlets and Post Office

Account Sites

3.3.3.1 All visitors to Post Office Account sites who need access to operational systems

must have a company identity card, which includes their photograph and pass
number. For all such visits, the pass number of the visitor must be notified in
advance to the relevant manager; access will not be permitted if this has not been
done.

3.3.3.2 Post Office Ltd. Auditors may visit Post Office outlets and other Outlets without

prior notice to the Post Office Manager.

3.3.3.3. Post Office Account visitors to Post Office Outlets must be subject to Post Office

Account vetting procedures and approval by Post Office Ltd.

3.3.3.4 Other visitors to Post Office Outlets are also subject to agreed vetting procedures.

3.3.4 Telephone Authentication at Help Desks

The Help Desks receive calls from Customers, Post Office Ltd. staff at Post Office outlets
and other people such as Post Office Account staff. The following categories of call have
different authentication requirements:

Category 1: Calls where the source of call would not affect the action taken. For example,
the call is just a query of generally available information.

Category 2: Where the result of the call is to cause an action which has only limited
consequences e.g. to report a problem in the Post Office Outlet (which could result in an
engineer call).

Category 3: Where the consequences of misidentifying of the caller can be serious and the
telephone authentication is the only authentication of the caller. For example, the wrong
person may be allowed access to sensitive information, and/or be able to disrupt the
service.

Category 4: Where the consequences of the call could potentially be serious, but
authentication of the user on the phone is only part of the process needed to complete an
action. For example, a Post Office Manager has lost the PIN associated with the card used
to boot the system, but will still also require a password to use the system.

3.3.4.1 For category I calls, no authentication is needed.

3.3.4.2 For category 2 calls made, for example, by Post Office Ltd. staff, at least the

location of the caller should be verified, for example, the particular Post Office
outlet, or Post Office Ltd. regional centre. This location must be one already
known to the Help Desk for which suitable verification information is available.

Fujitsu Services Access Control Policy Ref: RS/POL/003
Version: 6.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 08-Aug-03

3.3.4.3. For category 3 calls, the caller must be identified individually. (If the person
concerned is not known individually to the Help Desk, the call must be routed via
a known centre for verification. For example, calls from Post Office staff at the
Outlet could be routed via a Post Office Ltd. regional centre whose staff
authenticate to the Post Office Account Help Desk.)

3.3.4.4 For category 4 calls, the authentication process should at least verify the location
of the call to one known and acceptable for this type of call.

3.3.4.5 Help Desks must maintain the information required to authenticate the callers and
their Outlets/offices as required for the type of call.

3.3.4.6 If the call needs to be passed onto another internal Post Office Account help desk,
the call should be forwarded only after the initial authentication has been carried
out.

3.3.4.7 There are several different types of calls in each category. The authentication
process for each call type must conform to these policies.

Details of the information used for different types of call must conform to these policies and
be given in the appropriate Help Desk procedures.

3.3.5 Control of Human Access to Resources

Control of access to resources is achieved partly by workstation set-up and partly by
administration of the resource, e.g. in the form of an access control list. Details of the way the
access controls are implemented in information systems depend on the product used. They
are not defined in this policy document.

3.3.5.1 All human users with access to Post Office Account Data Centre or Post Office
Account managed systems on other sites must do so using controlled workstations
as defined in 3.6.1.

3.3.5.2 Access controls associated with resources should define the “role” of the user, not
the individual user’s identity (unless there is an agreed need for individual access).
The role may be represented by a group identity, for example, in products such as
Riposte, UNIX and Windows NT, which support groups, not roles directly.

3.3.5.3. Access controls associated with resources should provide access to the resources
as in the role definitions in chapter 6.

3.4 Non Human Users

Much of the operational Horizon system is automated. Some users are therefore system, not
human users, so there are usernames and passwords for both types of users. In general,
system users should be subject to the controls specified above (e.g. for password protection).
This is because these usernames generally cannot be confined only to human users and

Version: 6.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 08-Aug-03

therefore they can potentially permit access to usernames intended for system users.
However, some differences are permitted.

3.4.1.1 The username and password used to automate the login may be held in clear if it is
only accessible to authorised operational management staff for that system and the
potential damage from misuse of that username is minimised.

3.4.1.2 The password may expire less frequently than the 30 days for human users where
suitably obscure passwords are used, and the risk of external access to such
accounts is very low.

3.5 Information and Resource Access

This Policy is concerned with protecting information contained in, and transmitted between
all Horizon systems. This includes the Data Centres, Post Office Account managed systems
(such as interface systems at Post Office Ltd. and other Outlets), and the systems used to
access Data Centre and managed systems. Information requiring protection includes that
generated during fault investigations/correction and that retained for auditing and fraud
investigation.

3.5.1.1 I Human access to sensitive information should be restricted to those whose role
authorises them to see it.

3.5.1.2. Information in transit between systems should be encrypted for confidentiality
and/or integrity according to the needs of the particular link as defined in the
Security Functional Specification [SFS].

3.5.1.3 Digital signatures should be used for integrity of business information between the
Post Office Outlets and other services where required. E.g. for signing automated
payments at the Post Office Outlet prior to transmission via Post Office Account
to Post Office Ltd. or Post Office Ltd. Clients. Some Clients may specify other
protection such as encryption.

3.5.1.4 System data should also be integrity protected when required. E.g., digital
signatures protect software distributed to the Post Office outlets and elsewhere.

Business information in filestore at the Post Office PCs should be encrypted.

Passwords should be stored in encrypted form separately from application data
and executable code, except for the specific cases listed in Non Human Access
above.

3.5.1.7. Horizon systems should prevent interference between human user roles, between
applications and between human users and automated applications.

3.5.1.8 Information should be appropriately separated in filestore, database tables etc.
Each data set should be accessible only to those with a need for that access.

3.5.1.16

Different applications should run in their own user names or that of the user that
calls them (or at the Post Office Outlet, in the Riposte username impersonating the
user).

Access to shared resources such as filestore should be controlled by:

Access to that filestore being restricted to a specific product which is available
only to authorised users, or

Access to those resources being restricted to users in specified roles. (Group IDs
may be used to represent roles. Access control lists using these will ensure that
only authorised people can access the resource).

Information in relational databases should be accessible only via authorised client
“applications” (such as Oracle Forms, Discoverer, Business Objects, Tivoli
database interfaces) except where there is a proven need for lower level access.
Lower level access will only be granted for agreed operational management and
support functions.

System Management actions by Tivoli should be activated using pre-defined
Tivoli tasks authorised for use by SMC and the Post Office Account configuration
management and software distribution process. This includes collection of
diagnostic information from the Post Office Outlet for application support.

Packages (such as Oracle and Tivoli) and applications above the operating system
must also conform to the Access Control Policy. For example, Oracle should
restrict users to the authorised tables and views. Also, access to the package’s
resources should use role based access controls.

For client-server applications (such as Oracle Forms ones), audit records should
be generated at the server so audit logs do not rely on input from workstations.

Security audit logs must be protected from everyone except those permitted to
take specified Security Event Auditor roles. Unless otherwise specified for a
particular domain (such as the Post Office outlets), the security-auditing role is
separate from other roles at that domain.

All systems, except Post Office counter systems, must provide read access to audit
trails by authorised security auditors.

3.5.2 Key Management

Cryptography is used widely in Post Office Account as described in the Security Functional
Specification [SFS] for:

e Protecting information on links for confidentiality, integrity and origin authentication in
line with the requirements for that link.

e End-to-end integrity and data origin authentication, potentially over multiple links using
digital signatures.

«  Filestore encryption at the Post Office Outlet.

e Protecting keys associated with the production of PINPads and with the keys that protect
customer PINs.

The following general policies apply for protection of keys.
3.5.2.1 CESG approved keys must be protected in line with CESG requirements.

3.5.2.2. Key material (symmetric keys, DSA private keys and DSA entropy) should be
held in clear only when in physically secure environments.

3.5.2.3 Public keys (except for the CA’s public key) should be held in certificates signed
by the Certification Authority.

3.5.2.4 Symmetric keys should only be stored where necessary, and be held securely.

3.5.2.5 Keys (or part keys) held in filestore must be in a separate filestore accessible only
to authorised key custodians via authorised applications.

3.5.2.6 Keys used for protecting data should not be resident in filestore in clear.

3.5.2.7. Keys should be changed periodically according to CESG policy or, where
commercial algorithms are employed, in accordance with industry recognised
timescales. Different periods may apply to Symmetric Keys used for encrypting
data, Key Encryption Keys (KEKs) used to encrypt other keys and Certification
Authority keys.

3.5.2.8 New KEKs should not be distributed solely under the protection of existing
KEKs.

3.5.2.9 Key material in transit electronically must be encrypted (except for CHAP keys
between the routers within the Post Office Account Data Centre LAN).

3.5.2.10 Cryptographic keys and Key Encryption Keys are either installed locally at the
machine where they are to be used, or are distributed electronically using an
approved protocol which protects these keys in transit.

3.5.2.11 I Where a key is delivered in two parts (e.g. a red key and a black key), the parts
should be delivered by different routes.

3.5.2.12 The key (or part key) to be handled manually must be held in a locked safe when
not in use. Access to this must be authorised and recorded in conformance with
Post Office Account procedures.

3.5.2.13

The creation, handling, transmission and storage of keys must be undertaken in
accordance with ISO9564. Key generation must be undertaken on standalone
workstations or other hardware units within a physically secure environment.

In addition, the following policies also apply to the management of NB related keys:

3.5.2.14

3.5.2.15

3.5.2.16

3.5.2.17

Key generation and management must comply with ISO11568 Parts I to 3.

All keys that may directly or indirectly reveal a plain text PIN must be generated,
handled, transcribed and stored in a way which ensures that no one individual has
access to all key parts.

PINs and any cryptographic key that may directly or indirectly reveal them must
never appear in plain text outside a tamper detecting hardware security device
complying with the relevant section of IS09564. Modules handling PINs or keys
associated with multiple PINPads should conform to FIPS 140-1 level 3.

Devices used to generate keys associated with PIN encryption and PINPad
loading must be physically secure and conform to agreed standards.

3.6 System Set-up Policies

3.6.1 Workstation Set-up Policies

3.6.1.1

3.6.1.2

3.6.1.3

3.6.1.4

Users with interactive access to Horizon systems should use “controlled, NT
workstations” as defined in the following policies in this section. All such
exceptions to the “Implementation Guide for NT Platforms” policy must be
authorised and documented in the ACP.

Workstations from which operational systems can be updated should have floppy
drives disabled or be fitted with physical locking devices. Booting from CDROM
should also be disabled once a system has been configured. In all cases,
exceptions to this rule must be agreed with Post Office Account Security
Management and Horizon and be documented.

Workstations at the Post Office display sensitive business data (e.g. about
payments) as part of normal operation. All other workstations, which can display
sensitive information, should be in physically secure areas.

All systems should have the required roles, groups and other privileges set up on
installation. It should rarely be necessary to update these. “Guest” users must not
be enabled in the installed systems, and where possible, should not be included.
Other generic users should not be accessible for user logon except in exceptional
circumstances explicitly defined in the appropriate section below.

Operating system set-up and services available at that workstation should be
controlled by Post Office Account or shown to conform to Post Office Account
standards.

After a workstation is booted up, a login screen should be displayed which cannot
be by-passed.

The selection of tasks available on the desktop (or via secure menu system, where
used) should be constrained to those available to users with that role.

3.6.2 Server Set-up

3.6.2.1

3.6.2.2

Servers should have floppy drives disabled at boot time. Booting from CDROM
should also be disabled once a system has been configured. In all cases,
exceptions to this rule must be agreed with Post Office Account Security
Management and be documented.

Where a server is delivered with pre-defined usernames for human users, these
should be deleted (or if this is not possible, disabled) once the initial individual
usernames for administering the system have been set-up. Usernames should be
disabled by changing to a password, which is extremely difficult to guess, then
storing this password in a safe with appropriate manual controls for recording
access.

3.6.3. Workstation Environment Related Access Controls

3.6.3.1

Users with interactive access to Horizon systems should access these systems via
controlled, NT workstations in secure environments as defined in the following
policies. All exceptions to these policies must be authorised and documented in
the ACP.

The following diagram shows the main types of workstation environment supported for
access to the Post Office Account Data Centres and other Post Office Account managed

systems:

Workstations that have access to sensitive data or can be used to access Horizon
systems (code or data) should be on separate secure LANS linked only into the
Post Office Account secure network. (Site types 1 and 2 and the Data Centres)

The only permitted exceptions are:

¢ For authorised transfers of software and data from the controlled Post Office

Account LAN at the management site at Feltham to the appropriate Data Centre
system.

e For application support users linking to test rigs. In agreed circumstances,

authorised application support users may access operational data to investigate a
problem and may download that data to the workstation or test rigs.

¢ For management support and systems management access to the Data Warehouse.

This is via the SMDB situated within a DMZ.

In these site type 3 cases, firewalls between the LAN on the project site and the encrypted
link to the Data Centres must constrain traffic to just that authorised from identified project
systems to the identified Data Centre systems.

3.6.3.4

3.6.3.5

All such users should authenticate using a token.

The secure LAN and workstations must be in a physically secure area restricted to
permitted users. This also applies to any routers, encryption boxes and firewalls
connecting them to the Post Office Account Data Centres.

3.6.3.6 I Where the workstation is remote from the system being accessed, encrypted links
should be used.

There may be exceptions to this policy in the case of FTMS links to Post Office Ltd. Clients,
in any such cases the client is made fully aware the risks taken in using unencrypted links
(see also 3.7.2.7 below).

3.6.3.7 I Where a user also needs access to internal Horizon systems (such as the call
recording and management systems and e-mail), the user must use a second
workstation linked to the internal network and system required but not to the Post
Office Account Data Centre. (Site types 2 and 3).

3.6.3.8 Incident tracking systems using networks outside the Post Office Account secure
controlled area, for example e.g. the Fujitsu Services corporate network, may
include information relating to a particular record of customer data but must not
include such data, unless adequately protected, for example, by encryption.

3.6.3.9 I Any external users must conform to these policies.

3.6.3.10 I External support users of Horizon systems (such as Sequent and Cisco) should be
permitted access to Post Office Account Data Centre systems only from approved
Outlets/environments and subject to agreed network and other controls (see 4.6.3).

3.6.3.11 I Where, by the nature of the role(s) to be performed, the workstation requires
access to the Diskette or CR-ROM sub-systems, the workstation must be afforded
additional protection through the use of anti-virus software. Where appropriate
other controls such as the use of physical floppy locking devices and BIOS
passwords should also be employed.

3.7 Network Access Policies

Post Office Account controls should restrict who can access particular services. This covers
all traffic in and out of, as well as within, the Post Office Account Data Centres and managed
systems and also within parts of the Post Office Account management systems. In addition to
the workstation environment controls above, network access policies should be enforced
where appropriate by the use of a combination of access lists at routers, controls at firewalls,
NT domain controls, platform controls on use of ports and other application controls.

3.7.1 Information in Transit

3.7.1.1 Business and system data in transit to/from the Post Office Account Data Centres
must be protected in accordance with [SFS]. This covers, for example:

e Transfer of data to/from Post Office Account managed systems at other Outlets
such as Post Office Ltd. and Post Office Ltd. Client systems.

e Business and system management traffic to/from the Post Office outlets (which is
protected using a VPN to provide authentication and encryption as well as digital
signatures in some cases - see above)

Business and system information between the Data Centres and Post Office
Account management and Outlet Business Change sites

NBS data transferred to/from the Data Centres and the NBE.

The Energis ATM network with its closed user group should be used to restrict
access to the main Post Office Ltd. data (TIP and Reference data) to Post Office
Account only.

All Fujitsu Services Core Services links should use VPN protection (for
authentication and encryption) or in cases where that cannot be justified, CHAP
authentication and CLI.

3.7.2.2

3.7.2.3

3.7.2.4

3.7.2.5

3.7.2.6

3.7.2.7

All access in and out of the Post Office Account Data Centres should be restricted
to the required traffic from/to the authorised sources/destinations for business and
system traffic using routers and firewalls. Such traffic should be routed only to the
ports at systems, which require that traffic.

All management and support users access the Data Centres (and other managed
systems) from controlled workstation environments as defined in 3.6.3 above.

All Post Office Account Corporate management, system management and support
sites with access to the main operational systems should have fixed links to the
Data Centres.

External support users with access to any of the Horizon systems containing
sensitive or protectively marked information must access the systems via
controlled workstations and environments as for Post Office Account support
staff, but subject to extra controls — see appropriate section below. (Support of
routers is an exception — see below).

All such fixed links should be protected by the use of hardware encryption devices
using the Rambutan algorithm or where this is not appropriate, by the use of an
agreed commercial algorithm.

Apart from links via the Energis closed user group to the main Post Office Ltd.
systems (and via Post Office Ltd., to Royal Mail), all access to the Data Centre by
external organisations for support or other purposes should be firewalled from the
main Data Centre systems. Any exception to this must be agreed with the Post
Office Account Security Manager and documented in the ACP.

Traffic to/from Post Office Account managed interface PCs/routers at other
Outlets (Post Office Ltd., Post Office Ltd. Clients etc) should be restricted (by
routers and firewalls) to:

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 08-Aug-03

e Authorised business traffic between the managed system and the particular Post
Office Account Data Centre server handling that link (normally just file transfer
between the systems).

e Network management traffic between the routers and the NMS.

e System management traffic between the PCs and Tivoli Management Centre

3.7.2.8 RADIUS Servers at the Data Centres authenticate traffic from managed PCs at
Outlets. The Radius Servers, which are introduced with FRIACO network services
for NBS, hold CHAP usernames and passwords for the live estate. No operational
Post Office traffic should be accepted via other routes. Routers should also
restrict where traffic can be routed to/from within the Data Centre i.c. to VPN
servers the Correspondence Servers, Tivoli management servers and KMS.

3.7.2.9 I When implementing a new or significantly changed Post Office Outlet, the initial
connection will be to a dedicated boot server. Access to this from the Post Office
outlets is via a firewall, which also restricts traffic between the boot server and the
main Horizon Data Centre LAN.

3.7.2.10 Routers should be configured to deny access to external users (e.g. CISCO
support) until this access has been agreed - see 4.6.3. When permitted, the
appropriate router should be configured to restrict access to the Data Centre to the
particular system(s) needing support.

3.7.3 Controlling Traffic Within Data Centres

3.7.3.1 Controls in the Data Centre should reduce the possibility of interference between
systems by separating independent parts of the system, particularly where these
which have different security requirements. (This may be by a combination of
network set-up, router controls, controls at ports of specific systems and NT
domain structure.) For example,

e Systems concerned with Outlet Business Change should be separate from those
used for operational running.

e Security services, e.g. the Key Management Service (KMS), should be well
protected from unauthorised access from other systems.

3.7.3.2. Traffic originating within the Post Office Account Data Centres is generally
initiated by controlled applications. These applications (and the way they are
configured in the system) should restrict traffic between systems to the minimum
necessary.

3.7.3.3. Additional network controls should be used where specific systems are subject to
higher risks or vulnerabilities in the Data Centre network. All such special cases
should be documented in the ACP.

3.7.4 Controlling Traffic at and from Post Office Account Project Sites

Post Office Account project sites include:

e Various systems and operational management sites and support sites

e The main Post Office Account management Sites

¢ The OBC Teams main site

¢ Offices used by Post Office Account Regional Managers

3.7.4.1

3.7.4.2

3.7.4.3

3.7.4.4

3.7.4.5

3.7.4.6

3.7.4.7

The main Post Office Account management sites should separate their main
networks from both the Fujitsu Corporate network and from those more secure
LANs used to access the Data Centre e.g. via a DMZ.

Most local users should only have access to specific LANs that provide access to
local services and (via controlled connections) to the Fujitsu Corporate network.

The only permitted connections from this management site network should be:

To the Fujitsu Corporate network via a controlled router, which restricts traffic to
that permitted.

To OBC users at regional offices and OBC suppliers at their sites via a controlled
router and firewalls.

To the secure LANs via a firewall which restricts data to that permitted (e.g.
software from the Configuration Management system).

The only permitted connections from the secure LANs should be:
To the Data Centres via encrypted links.

To other secure LANs via an encrypted link (i.e. between the Post Office Account
management sites).

All users with any interactive access to the Data Centres must do so via secure
LANs (see also 3.6.3)

Separate secure LANs should be used for separate user groups/activities where
sensitive data is being handled at Post Office Account management sites. For
example, Security Management and Audit users should be on a separate high
security LAN separate from other users.

Servers at the Post Office Account management sites that handle
sensitive/RESTRICTED data or are used to update the Data Centre require
stronger security and they should be on a secure LAN. This applies, for example,
to the CM signing server, which distributes software to the Data Centre and
reconciliation database.

4.0 Specific Human Access Controls

4.1 Introduction

This chapter deals with access control polices, in particular authentication policies for
specialised human user roles and where exceptions to these polices are permitted.

Note that a full list of Post Office Account roles, outlining the IT access permitted to each of
them, is given in chapter 6.

4.2. Post Office Outlets — Operational and Installation Roles

There are no system management and support roles at the Post Office outlets. These tasks are
run remotely apart from some limited tasks available to Post Office managers.

4.2.1 Post Office Normal Running

For normal functions, Post Office Managers, Clerks and Supervisors authenticate using a
Riposte username and password.

On normal counter start up (once installation is complete) the Post Office Manager (or
authorised other user) uses the Post Office Memory card and PIN (which is also used in
protecting the filestore, as defined in the [SFS]).

The following specialisations of the policies in chapter 3 apply in these cases.
4.2.1.1 A password cannot be re-used for 18 months.

4.2.1.2 The password is checked to conform to quality standards as follows:
e The password cannot contain spaces;

e The password cannot be one of an agreed “excluded passwords” list.

4.2.1.3 After a period of inactivity at a Post Office counter, the session will time out but
can be resumed on entry of the password. After a longer period of inactivity, the
user is forcibly logged out.

4.2.1.4 The PIN used for the Post Office Manager’s memory card is a 15 character
alphanumeric value.

4.2.1.5 I The Post Office Manager should secure the Memory card and associated PIN in
separate places.

4.2.1.6 I When anew Post Office user is added to the system, a full name must be supplied.
This ensures that the user can be identified from the user name included in the
transaction logged in the Riposte journals.

4.2.2 Customer Authentication at Post Office Outlets

For most Post Office operations, customers do not need to authenticate themselves.

4.2.3 Post Office Exceptional Cases except Installation

This subsection includes exceptional cases involving the Post Office Manager and other Post
Office staff and also supports engineers, Post Office Ltd. auditors and emergency managers.

For some user groups, and some exceptional circumstances, the Post Office Manager (or
other authorised person) authenticates using a one-time password with the assistance of the
Horizon System Help Desk (HSHD). The Post Office system generates a value, then phones
the HSHD authenticating to the HSHD as defined for that user role/circumstances (see
[ACUA PPD)). The HSHD (after authenticating the user) provides a check value that the user
can type in at the Post Office counter to authenticate themselves.

The following policies apply to these exceptions.

4.2.3.1 If there is a failure on booting the counter systems after installation of new
software, the Post Office Manager then reverts to the failsafe version of NT
supported by HSHD and using a one-time password.

4.2.3.2 If the Manager loses his password, he (or an authorised deputy in his absence)
logs into a SUPPORT username using a one-time password provided via the
HSHD.

4.2.3.3 If the Manager loses his card or PIN, he obtains an emergency recovery key via
the HSHD (after authenticate to the HSHD).

4.2.3.4 Support engineers (installing new hardware and running tests to check it) and
Auditors use generic Riposte usernames for the appropriate role and authenticate
via one-time passwords. For both engineers and auditors, the pass number is also
typed in; so individual users can be identified in the log.

4.2.3.5 If a Post Office Ltd. Emergency Manager takes over a Post office when the
manager is unavailable or unco-operative, he may use the emergency recovery
procedure to boot up the Post Office — see 4.2.3.3.

4.2.4 Installation Roles at Post Office Outlets
On installation of a Post Office Outlet,
e The installation engineer sets up the connection to the data centre

e The Post Office Manager (POM) completes the Post Office set-up for normal working
including set up of the memory card and PIN

4.2.4.1 The installation engineer must authenticate to the POM (see Visitor
Authentication) prior to using the Auto-configuration application. Authentication
to NT or Riposte must be impossible at this stage.

Version: 6.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 08-Aug-03

4.2.4.2 On first installation of the Post Office (after memory card set-up), the Manager
logs in under the Set-up Manager username to create his individual username. He
then logs in using this, and deletes the Set-up Manager username. On all future
occasions, the POM must authenticate using his individual user name except in
cases identified in 4.2.3 above.

4.3 Corporate (including Security) Management Users

Unless stated otherwise, all corporate management users are authenticated to their local NT
domain using a security token. They use controlled NT workstations on secure LANs at Post
Office Account sites linked by encrypted links to the Data Centres (see site type I in 3.6.3).

4.3.1 Business Management

These users may also need to authenticate to the relevant system and/or application for
particular systems. This is required for Oracle applications, and for Business Object universes
used to access data at Data Warehouse systems via Oracle/Business objects.

The only specialisation’s and exceptions to the policies in chapter 3 for these users are:

4.3.1.1 People in the following roles have access to CD writers at their workstations:

- Management support users, who write agreed warehouse data to CD for transfer to
Post Office Ltd.

- The Business Function Auditor, who provides information to external auditors

- Security Management users for generation of key material.

4.3.2. Key Management

4.3.2.1. The Key Manager is responsible for the generation or other acquisition of
cryptographic keys and organising their distribution.

4.3.2.2. The Key Custodian uses the local console at the platform where the key is to be
installed/changed and authenticates using a token to the local system. (For NT,
this is defined as a local role)

4.3.2.3. The Key Handler has the key on the appropriate media (e.g. floppy) for re-
installation of the key during system reboot. He is not a known user of the system
and does not authenticate to it.

4.3.2.4 The Key Handler role may be performed by identified, authorised (non-Post
Office Account) staff at remote Post Office Account managed systems e.g. by
Post Office Ltd. etc. at interface PCs at their sites.

4.3.2.5 The Cryptographic Key Manager and KMA Data Manager roles are SQL Server
users, so log-on to Oracle (after NT workstation, token logon). This gives access
to specific functions only.

4.4 Outlet Business Change Users

No specialisation to the policies in chapter 3 have yet been identified for OBC users, except
at the Post Office — see above.

4.5 System Management and Related Users

All system management, operational management and application support users have
controlled NT workstations for management/support activities, and a separate workstation for
access to call monitoring and other systems as in 3.6.3 site type 2 and 3.

4.5.1.1 SMC/HIT technicians, and other Tivoli users (e.g. Auditors, SSC application
support) authenticate to Tivoli as well as the workstation logon to NT.

4.5.1.2 For Post Office Key Recovery, the SMC Team Leader may also need to log onto
the KMA via the specific KMS role created for this purpose.

4.5.1.3 SMC/HIT technicians also have limited read only access to some data centre
systems for the purposes of fault diagnosis. Access is via SSH client on the
support Terminal Server.

4.5.1.4 All network technicians access only the NMS and routers, so access for them is
described in that section.

4.5.1.5 Controlled access to floppy diskette and/or CD devices is permitted in exceptional
circumstances where such access is required in order to achieve the desired
functionality, e.g. on AP client remote platforms where diskette is the nominated
media for onward transmission of AP clients data, on Audit workstation from
which extracts of audited information are delivered on CD-ROM.

4.5.2 Engineering Access

4.5.2.1 Where possible, engineering access to the machines, for example, for hardware
diagnosis and repair, should be subject to the same controls as other users, as
specified in chapter 3.

4.5.2.2 In agreed, limited circumstances, (e.g. when the operating system cannot be
booted) special access is permitted, by-passing the normal controls. In all such
cases any visiting engineer must be subject to the policies for “authentication of
visitors” (see chapter 3) and two people must be present during such access.

4.5.3 Procedures for getting in Support Staff

A number of problems can lead to staff being required to support the system. This could be
Core Services or SSC staff coming in to support the system from their normal support sites.
However, it could also require support staff from other organisations such as Sequent or
Cisco. Core Services is generally responsible for the call out procedures.

POL00400791

Fujitsu Services Access Control Policy Ref: RS/POL/003

Version: 6.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 08-Aug-03

All requests for technical support should be made to the Horizon System Help
Desk. The identity of the caller requesting support (if by telephone) should be
verified to ensure the call comes from an appropriate source, before being
actioned. The Help Desk will pass on the call to the appropriate unit in line with
Help Desk Procedures using the call handling system.

All support calls should be recorded in the call handling system and their progress
reported there, including who was called out and the actions taken.

Routers will by default, be configured to prevent access from support
organisations other than the standard Core Services. When support is required
from another authorised site (e.g. Sequent or Cisco), a router should be configured
to allow this access, and then re-configured to disallow it after use.

4.5.4 Software Distribution and Exceptions for Fixes

4.5.4.1

4.5.4.2

All software (new software and fixes) must be registered in the configuration
management system controlled by configuration librarians. It should be tested
using test rigs and authorised by the CS Release Manager prior to distribution by
Software Distributors.

In exceptional circumstances, where this is not fast enough, authorised code fixes
may be done directly by Core Services according to agreed procedures.

4.5.5 Application Support

Application Support calls come via HSHD, from there they are forwarded to the appropriate
unit. Many application support calls are routed to SMC/HIT for filtering known errors, before
being forwarded to System Support Centre (SSC) or Core Services as appropriate for solving.
Calls may sometimes be forwarded to other 3 and potentially also to 4th line support units,
which may include application suppliers.

Note that no application support users have access to Post Office counter systems except as
allowed for in 4.5.5.2 below. Errors here are diagnosed using logs of events extracted via

Tivoli.

4.5.5.1 All support users with access to the Post Office Account Data Centre must do so
using NT controlled workstations in a secure workstation environment as defined
in 3.3. (For SSC, the secure environment must include a firewall to restrict traffic
between the test rigs and the secure LAN, though the workstation gives access to
both Data Centres and test rigs.)

4.5.5.2 Limited data may be downloaded from the Data Centres to the SSC test rigs where
this is required to assist in diagnosing application problems and testing new
software to fix the problem.

4.5.5.3. Support users should have only read access to the supported systems, except for:

e SSC support managers (not normal SSC support users) “correcting” data under
controlled conditions. (Data may need to be corrected where it has been corrupted
by faulty code.) Correction of data must be subject to agreed authorisation
procedures.

e Core Services operational management staff that will fast fix code, when
authorised, under controlled conditions. Where time permits, correction of errors
should be by re-issue of a new version of the software via the Configuration
management system. When faster fixing is required, agreed Post Office Account
authorisation procedures must be followed. For applications supported by SSC,
this will start with a request by SSC.

Remote access to FTMS Gateways and Counters is managed and supported using
SSH client on a support Terminal Server.

4.5.5.4 In all cases, updates to code or data by application support staff require two staff
to be present when the change is made and all such changes to be audited,
identifying what has been changed (before and after values) and the individual
who made the change.

5.0 Specific System Access Controls

5.1 Introduction

This chapter deals with cases where the access control policies in chapter 3 are specialised for
particular systems and where exceptions to these policies are permitted.

In addition to the policies in chapter 3, all systems should support the roles in chapter 6, with
only the required functions and resources available as defined there with the human access
controls defined in chapter 4.

Note: the ACP does not cover internal systems such as Powerhelp and PinICL.

5.2. Post Office outlets Platforms

A multi-counter Post Office has a local LAN with NT workstations, one of which is the
gateway with a link to the Post Office Account Data Centres.

5.2.1 Human Users

The roles supported are Post Office staff (Post Office Manager, Counter Clerk and
Supervisor), Customer (indirectly), Post Office Ltd. Auditors and Emergency Managers,
Engineers (Support and Installation Engineers) (see 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4).

5.2.1.1 At no stage after leaving the factory should it be possible to logon directly to
Windows NT or for a user to access NT functions or data.

5.2.1.2 No operational management roles should be supported at the Post Office systems,
or any other roles apart from than those listed above.

5.2.2. Factory Set-up Controls

Software is installed at the factory (though may be updated on installation) and initial
configuration done.

5.2.2.1 Riposte user groups set-up should be Manager, Supervisor, Clerk, Engineer,
PinPad Install, Auditor, AuditorE (used by Emergency Managers), Support (used
for emergency procedures such as the Manager forgetting his password). The
Engineer, Auditor, AuditorE and Support groups should be set up to require one-
time password authentication.

5.2.2.2. Usernames should be set up in Riposte and NT for an Engineer, an Emergency
Manager, a Support user and for a number of Auditors (enough to allow an auditor
at each counter of the largest Post Office) and a set-up manager associated with
the relevant Riposte groups. (The Post Office Manager will introduce further users
later.)

5.2.2.3. When leaving the factory, it should only be possible to run the Auto-configuration
application, not log-on to NT or Riposte.

5.2.3 Post Installation Controls

5.2.3.1

5.2.3.2

5.2.3.3

5.2.3.4

After installation, special software used for installation only should not be
accessible. Usernames used for installation only should be removed.

The encrypted filestore should not be accessible unless the workstation has been
booted using the memory card and PIN (or agreed emergency procedures).

After a user has logged on using Riposte, all access to the system should be
controlled by Riposte — the Riposte desktop should allow access to only those
items available to people in the user’s role. The user must not be able to call any
other applications or NT functions or resources. No direct access to Windows NT
should be possible at any time, even for engineers.

The Riposte infrastructure should not need NT administrator privilege.

5.3 Sequent Systems

5.3.1 Introduction

Sequent systems with Dynix operating system and Oracle databases are used for the main
operational applications (see 2.1) and the Data Warehouse (see 2.2) at the Data Centres. The
systems also have data in flat files (e.g. before/after transfer to/from other systems).

5.3.2. Human Access

All Sequent systems support the operational management and support roles listed in chapter
6. They also support application roles for the particular applications such as ODBC, RDMC
and Business Objects for access to Data Warehouse data.

5.3.2.1

5.3.2.2

5.3.2.3

5.3.2.4

All business users (such as the Business Support unit) should use Oracle
applications — Oracle Forms, Business Objects or Discover3i.

Where the SQL*Net or Oracle NET 8 access to the database could potentially
give more access than that permitted for the business role, the application at the
client must restrict access to that permitted. In addition, a secure controlled
workstation conforming to Post Office Account policies (see 3.2) must be used
and the user identified there with the correct role so that the application controls
cannot be by-passed.

Users using only Oracle via applications on their controlled workstations should
be registered to the Oracle application, not the underlying operating system, and
authenticate using a password.

Where users need to be both UNIX and Oracle users, they should be registered in
UNIX, and have Oracle use the result of the UNIX (and security token)
authentication.

5.3.2.5 Oracle database administration functions should use:
e Patrol for monitoring the database

e Pre-defined Discover queries to examine the state of the database. (Discoverer
should be configured to restrict access to the tables and views needed for the task
and audit actions.)

e Pre-defined, authorised SQL*Plus for database updates (which should include
auditing)

Application support users of Oracle should use:
e  Pre-defined forms for correcting standard types of data problem
e  Pre-authorised SQL*Plus scripts for correcting other data problems

All pre-defined forms and pre-authorised scripts should audit the correction made.

5.3.2.7. Users who require any access to operating system facilities must do so via a
secure menu system that restricts the user to functions authorised for users of that
role (and audits all functions performed by that user).

5.3.2.8 Where a function called from the secure menu system requires a change of
username, that change should be done automatically by the menu system and
audited. Changes to username must also cause a Patrol event.

5.3.2.9 The secure menu system should have specific functions for most system
management activities. However, for emergency use, the menu will include an
item that provides root access and use of UNIX commands.

5.3.2.10 Computer operators access Sequent systems from the console, using the secure
menu system to access a limited number of predefined jobs such as back-ups.

5.3.2.11 I Engineering access when the operating system cannot be fully booted, is via
“single user mode” under controlled conditions (see Visitor Authentication and
Engineering Access). Single user mode should only be used when more controlled
methods are not possible.

5.3.2.12 Operational management staff always authenticate under their own names to
UNIX and perform functions wherever possible without superuser/root privileges.
If root is needed, the appropriate menu item on the secure menu system will be
used to switch users. This will be audited and an alert sent to BMC Patrol so a
record remains available even if the audit log at the UNIX machine is
subsequently corrupted.

5.3.2.13 Where non-Post Office Account, e.g. Sequent staff provide 3rd line support, this
may be from the 3rd party site. In this case, access must be from a controlled NT
workstation and controlled environment as for Post Office Account operational
management - see 3.2. Call in procedures are as in 4.5.3.

5.3.2.14 As Sequent requires root access, an independent monitoring system will be used
where all key strokes on the Sequent workstation are captured and echoed on a
Core Services workstation.

5.3.2.15 Application support managers can correct application data subject to authorisation
procedures — see 4.5.5. For Oracle applications, this should, where possible, be via
specific functions available to the Oracle SSC role. In exceptional circumstances,
use of SQL*Plus scripts will be authorised after checking. For other services, this
may involve updates to flat files. In all cases, corrections to the data are audited.

5.3.3. Application/Oracle Roles at the Operational Sequent Systems

5.3.3.1 Database roles with appropriate database views/tables should be used to separate
what data is available to whom.

5.3.3.2 The following Oracle roles should be defined for all Oracle applications on the
operational Sequent servers. Note that in some cases, people with different human
roles in the list in chapter 6 may have the same access to the same Oracle role.

Oracle role Functions, and roles

MONITOR Read only access to application data in this database
- used by Auditors, application support ete

AUDITOR As MONITOR plus access to audit information

- used by auditors.

CORE_SERVI_ I Full dba privileges

CES_DBA

ssc As for MONITOR, plus limited updates, implemented by
pre-authorised SQL*Plus scripts.

MSU Specific business support functions on OBCS and some

other applications - see chapter 6.

5.3.3.3. Other application roles should be defined for particular applications to support the
application roles listed in chapter 6, for example, Reference Data roles at RDMC.

5.3.3.4 Information available to people doing ad-hoc queries should be further
constrained e.g. using Business Object universes.

Note that there are also roles for non-human users.

5.3.4 Dynix and Oracle Access Controls

5.3.4.1 The Dynix operating system should be set-up according to the access control
policy in 3 above.

5.3.4.2. Automated processes should do all loading/unloading of data to/from Oracle
databases. Separate interface tables should be used to restrict the damage possible
due to failures during automated processes.

5.3.4.3. The set-up of the system should be regularly monitored, for example, to check for
dormant accounts and to review any changes made to important system files.

5.4 Windows NT Systems

This section deals with NT workstations and servers at the Data Centres and other Post Office
Account managed NT systems except the Post Office outlets. NT workstations at secure Post
Office Account management and support sites should also conform to these policies, and the
NT domain policies.

5.4.1 Generic NT Policies

NT systems support the operational management and support roles listed in chapter 6 unless
otherwise stated.

5.4.1.1 As on other systems, engineers should only have controlled access and must be
accompanied by Core Services staff when using the system.

5.4.1.2 Apart from event logs ete, which are relevant to all NT systems, application
support users should access application databases via relevant tools, rather than
just operating system facilities.

5.4.1.3. All NT servers should be set up with a group and template user for the generic
management and support roles (plus any others defined for the particular NT
system). When a user is assigned to a role these templates should be used to set up
that user with the required user profile providing access only to those tools needed
to carry out the role.

5.4.1.4 While use of NT domains allows a user to log in once to multiple servers, some
roles (such as Engineer and Key Custodian) should always be defined as requiring
the user to be local to the machine.

5.4.2, NT Domain Policies

Windows NT domains are used in Post Office Account to control which NT servers can share
NT resources and which users have access to those resources. They are also used to simplify
user authentication — a user need only logon once to a domain (or once to a set of domains)
which have an established trust relationship that includes trust in the users of the domains.

NT domains should conform to the following policies:
5.4.2.1 NT domains should generally have at least one Backup Domain Controller. This

should be on a separate site from the Primary Domain Controller. Exceptions to
this must be agreed and are expected to be small domains with few users.

5.4.2.11

Where a set of related NT systems is run by a different authority from other NT
systems, this should be set up as a separate domain.

Where such a domain does not share users or resources with other domains, it
should be a separate domain with no trust relationship with other domains.

Domains may span sites where all NT workstations and servers in the domain are
run by the same authority and are subject to the same physical and network
security. (For example, the SMC system management domain spans the SMC
workstations attached to a secure LAN on the secure SMC Site and the Tivoli NT
servers at the Data Centre).

A domain must be confined within an area of the network, which is subject to the
same security policies and controls. For example, it must not include NT systems
on different sides of a firewall.

Where sharing of resources, but not users, is required between domains, then the
trust between domains should be restricted to sharing the agreed resources/files
across the domain boundary. The resource sharing must be restricted to the
minimum required for the agreed functions.

Where sharing of files is required between domains on different sides of a
firewall, this should be subject to special authorisation procedures as well as the
policy above.

A domain should not establish trust in users registered in a domain in a less
trusted part of the network.

Users should only have access to the NT systems to which they are permitted
access. The domain set up should prevent them accessing any other NT systems.

Users should not be registered as NT users at domains where their only access is
at the application level, for example, from a remote client via an application
protocol to a particular application that has its own logon.

Set up of NT domains should assist separation of systems to reduce interference
between them.

5.4.3 Correspondence Servers

5.4.3.1

Business Support and Auditor access to the operational Correspondence servers
should be restricted to exceptional circumstances for limited amounts of data (as
otherwise, the performance of the system could be impaired). In all cases, access
should be controlled, and limited to use of a specific agreed query tool.

5.4.4 Security Servers on NT

Security services on NT are:

e The Key Management Application (KMA) which generates and distributes cryptographic
keys to Horizon services and the Post Office outlets. An associated Certification
Authority Workstation (CAW) generates public key certificates and Entropy servers that
generate DSA entropy for digital signatures.

e The VPN servers used for protection of the traffic to Post Office outlets and across to Post
Office Outlet LAN.

e The audit and key management workstations supporting the Post Office Account Security
Manager and his staff.

e Signing servers to sign software and auto-configuration information sent to the Post
Office Outlet.

(This is in addition to the software security services to protect data in transit on particular

links.)

5.4.4.1

5.4.4.2

5.4.4.3

5.4.4.4

5.5

The Certification Authority Workstation (CAW) that includes the CA should be
off-line — not connected to any network.

The KMA should store all keys encrypted, and the key used to encrypt these keys
should be subject to the normal KEK policies — see 3.5.

Application level access to the KMA should be restricted to the agreed functions
for each of the specified roles, and each role should have the least privilege
needed to do the job. All security significant actions should be audited.

On-line interactive access by human users to the NT server on which the KMA
resides should not be generally possible. It should require approval by the Post
Office Account Security Manager to permit this access (except for key handling
on reboot). The access will only ever be permitted for:

e Read only access by application support staff (updates should always be via the
standard Tivoli software distribution)

e Limited, authorised, system admin access by local users

e Engineers

Authentication Service for Authentication using Tokens

Authentication using tokens will be supported by an Authentication Service at each Data

Centre

(one the master, generally used for all authentication, with the other acting as a slave

to provide resilience).

5.5.1.1

After installation and configuration of the Authentication Service, the only
application access to the Authentication service should be by the Post Office
Account Security Manager workstation at the Post Office Account management
site. These must be controlled NT workstations on the secure LAN (see chapter
3).

5.6 Cryptographic Boxes

5.6.1 Hardware Encryption Boxes

Hardware encryption boxes are used to provide link level encryption on a number of links.
These are government approved point-to-point encryption devices generally using Rambutan
encryption but can operate with commercial encryption algorithms where this is agreed.

5.6.1.1 Access controls at these devices should be as specified by the manufacturer and /
or informed by Post Office Account Security.

5.6.2 Host Security Modules.

Host Security Modules (HSMs) provide a secure environment in which to translate an
encrypted PIN value between domains — primarily between the Post Office Central Services
domain and the NBE domain.

5.6.2.1 Access control procedures for these devices is documented in NB/PRO/007.

5.6.3 Secure Configuration Terminals

Secure Configuration Terminals are hand-held devices used to generate and encrypt keys and
to load keys into HSMs.

5.6.3.1 Access control procedures for these devices is documented in NB/PRO/007.

5.7 Symmetrix discs

EMC require access to the live Central Host systems for support of the Symmetrix Remote
Data Facility used to replicate disk array data between two Campuses. The disk arrays are
monitored by an internal system, which regularly checks the disks against predefined
thresholds such as numbers of failed read or write attempts. When a threshold is exceeded,
the disk monitoring system automatically telephones the EMC support unit.

5.7.1.1 Access to EMC disc controller (and to discs) is as specified and restricted to the
use of the special EMC client

5.8 Interface Systems at Business and Outlet Business Change

The Horizon system manages interface PCs at some related Outlets (Post Office Ltd., Post
Office Ltd. Clients and Outlet Business Change supplier). It also manages the interfaces to
the Post Office Account network(e.g. routers.)

In all cases, routers are managed by Post Office Account Network Management and interface
PCs are managed using Horizon System Management.

5.8.1 Interface Systems with Interface PCs

Post Office Account has links to a number of Post Office Account managed interface PCs at
Sites remote from the Post Office Account Data Centres. These include Post Office Ltd. and
Post Office Ltd. Client systems. (The Post Office Ltd. TIP link is also used for Royal Mail
traffic.) There may also be interface systems at Post Office Account Outlet Business Change

Suppliers.

5.8.1.1

5.8.1.2

5.8.1.3

5.8.1.4

5.8.1.5

5.8.1.6

Once configured, the PCs and routers at these sites should not normally have any
human access ~ file transfers should be automated and the PCs managed remotely
using Tivoli.

The operational management role at these sites is limited to local system
administrative functions only.

The engineer role is restricted to installing or replacing the PC. The PC will not be
repaired when configured into the operational system.

Business data in transit to the Data Centres is protected as defined in 3.7 above.

Where the PC is directly connected to other systems (such as the Post Office Ltd.
ones), it should also be configured to restrict traffic with such systems.

Controls at the interface PCs at Post Office Ltd. (and similar) sites must ensure
separation of incoming and out going files so that all files supplied by Post Office
Account are read only for Post Office Ltd. access. In addition, files for different
systems (e.g. TIP, Royal Mail and Reference Data) are separated.

5.9 System Management Servers

A set of Tivoli system management servers are used to manage the Post Office systems and
related Data Centre NT systems (mainly using Tivoli products). They also monitor other Post
Office Account management systems and collect event data from other systems.

5.9.1.1

5.9.1.2

5.9.1.3

All users of Tivoli must be registered at the Tivoli server and associated with the
appropriate roles, groups (and regions) to restrict their access to facilities, which
they are permitted to access. (All such users have security tokens, so are also
registered with an Authentication Service)

In addition to SMC/HIT roles, Tivoli servers should also support:

Post Office Account Security Auditors with read access to audit information via
the web interface — platform audit logs, Tivoli notices, and Tivoli events collected
for auditing.

Application support users with access to pre-authorised Tivoli tasks to extract
diagnostic information from the Post Office.

Tivoli integrity features should also be used to protect Tivoli traffic on the link.

Interfacing sites

Figure 5-1 Network Management

There is a single Network Management Station (NMS) at each Post Office Account Data
Centre. NMS users use controlled NT workstations with tokens (see section 3) but also need
to log onto UNIX for access to authorised OpenView and Cisco Works/View functions.

In addition to NMS roles, there are also Cisco router support roles. Engineers may also
require direct access to routers.

There are no on-line application support roles. Support of Open View, Cisco Works ete is
done off-line. Post Office Account auditors access audit information from the NMS via audit
records sent through to Tivoli and extracted audit logs.

5.10.1.1 Network Management configuration must be carried out before live running and
the configuration independently validated and authorised by a senior Core
Services network person before use.

5.10.1.2 I Even though network management workstations run 24 hours a day, all users must
still be individually authenticated. (This implies that at the end of the shift, the
existing user must log out and the new user log on.)

5.10.1.3. Network management should normally be done using OpenView. In agreed
exceptional circumstances (for example, for fault resolution requiring use of the
debug facility, in times of excessive network workload or during fault conditions),
the network may be managed using router facilities directly via telnet, not via
Open View, and therefore not subject to its controls. This is confined to authorised
Core Services Network Managers using Telnet access to routers from a specific
dedicated NT system on the Operational Bridge area of the Network Centres.

5.10.1.11

Telnet access to routers is permitted only to Core Services senior network
management staff and Cisco staff supporting the routers from a remote CISCO
site. All such access must be authorised by a member of the Telnet authorisation
list. Manual records must be kept of this authorisation each time Telnet access is
used.

All users of Telnet access to routers must authenticate using TACACS+ and their
access audited at the NMS.

Cisco staff must access the router needing support via a separate gateway router
dedicated for Cisco use. This gateway router must be configured to permit Cisco
access only when Cisco support is needed. A different TACACS username and
password must be used on each occasion, valid for the particular session only.

The standard Cisco engineers must have only read access to the routers. Only
named and authorised senior CISCO staff may have the “enable” mode needed
for reviewing configuration files and debugging. CISCO staff should not make
changes to the routers, but advice the Network Manager of any changes required.

The only direct access permitted to routers is for engineers investigating hardware
problems. In this case, access should always be done locally at the router using a
console.

In normal running, the routers must not have consoles attached, though console
access may be enabled. Any attempt to log-on at a console should be via
TACACS+ and so be flagged at the NMS.

A faulty router must be configured out of the network before a console is attached
and the router engineer logs on to diagnose and repair the fault. When the router is
connected back into the system, its configuration must be checked and the new
configuration authorised before the router is configured for normal use in the
operational system.

Engineers are not individually known to the routers, so manual procedures must
identify the engineer when he visits the site before he is given today’s password.
The password used for direct router console access should be changed via the
NMS every 28 days and also immediately when an engineer requires access.

5.10.2 Firewall Management

Firewalls are managed using Enterprise Centres on Solaris systems (shared with Security
token management), one at each Data Centre.

Enterprise Centre roles supported are Firewall Manager and Firewall Monitor. There are no
on-line support roles for the Enterprise Centre application or the firewall application.

5.10.2.2

5.10.2.3

All access to the firewalls must be via the Enterprise Centre, except for hardware
maintenance. For routers, in normal running, firewalls must not have consoles
attached — they should only be attached for hardware maintenance after the
firewalls has been configured out of the system.

All configuration changes must be made via the Enterprise Centre and logged via
Tivoli. Firewall audit logs should also be sent to the Enterprise Centre.

Firewalls should restrict traffic as in the network access policies in 3.7. (This is
different for different firewalls).

5.11 Software Distribution Servers

Software distribution servers include the Configuration Management and associated signing
servers on Post Office Account project Outlets and the depot/Tivoli servers at the Data
Centres to which software is sent for onward transmission to other Horizon systems at the
Data Centres, Post Office outlets and elsewhere.

SALA

5.11.12

The Configuration management system should have access controls, which
conform to this policy, even though it is not at the data centre, or on a separate
secure LAN.

The associated signing server should be on the secure LAN, and controls should
be fully conformant with this policy.

5.12 OBC Servers at the Data Centres

The Post Office counters are delivered with a standard configuration, which needs to be
personalised and updated when installed.

The servers involved in this process are shown in the following diagram.

Notes:

This table does not include the Software distribution related roles at the Configuration
Management system, as the CM is not on the secure LANs covered by the ACP. Roles are:

CS Release Manager (authorising software (new software and fixes), configuration
information etc. for release (after testing at the test rigs).

Configuration librarians (maintaining the library of software at the Configuration
Management system and initiating signing and distribution of software after authorisation).

The Key Handler role needs to be performed on-site whenever systems are rebooted, so is
generally performed by the organisation at that site e.g. Post Office Ltd. at their Outlets.

There are associated manual processes to authorise some of the actions above and to liase
with other Post Office Account units involved in software distribution and auto-
configuration. For example:

Team Leaders and SMC Managers can authorise software distribution.
Only SMC Managers can authorise creation of new Tivoli tasks.

All changes distributed via Tivoli first go through the standard Configuration Management
system with its associated processes for change control, testing and authorising release.
