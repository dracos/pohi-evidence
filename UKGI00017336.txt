Hi Alwen

Sorry one more thing - I realised that the other thing I hadn't really done by way of diligence was discuss with you
/Susan how all the internal legal compliance / risk management type processes work. I would be intereseted to have
a session on that just to understand the different ways in which you handle things, what comes to the Board and so
on. I'd be happy to have a conversation after the next Board or at your convenience.

Best wishes

Susannah
