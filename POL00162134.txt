Hi Alice,

As Paula has trailed, please find set out below an outline proposed agenda for the inaugural meeting of the Board subcommittee on
Wednesday at 9:00am.

Terms Of Reference for the Sub Committee

Paper setting out the various options for the future of the Scheme

An update on the Horizon assurance work, which is being undertaken by Deloitte
AOB

feRe

In addition we will be circulating, by way of background information, a note of the key public commitments made by Post Office
with respect to the Scheme (which I understand you have asked for). All papers should be issued by early afternoon tomorrow.

In terms of attendees, I see that Outlook invitations have been sent to Paula, Chris D, Richard Callard, Belinda and Alasdair
Marnoch. Given the PR aspects of the matter, I would also suggest that Mark D attend and, for the first meeting at least, Angela at
least for that part of the discussions relating to the investigation process.

It would be great to have a chat in advance of the meeting; if you could let me know when you are free, I will make myself available!
Kind regards
Chris

Hi Alice, further to our earlier email exchange and just to keep you in the loop: Chris will drop a note across later today re.,
attendees and agenda for the above. He has kindly agreed to have a phone call with you to outline what our thoughts are re outcomes
from the meeting. (I'll leave it to Chris to arrange when.) As I mentioned, we reviewed a draft paper today, which sets out the issues
the committee needs to discuss and starts to scope some options. Subject to a final draft overnight, this should be out tomorrow early
pm and Chris is happy to talk through in his call with you.

T hope this is ok, don't hesitate to say so if not.

Best, Paula
