All,

Re the “14 bug”

Please find attached two draft letters to subpostmasters concerning the Horizon anomaly generated in 2010 which
manifested itself in financial years 2011 & 2012. The drafts principally differ depending on whether or not the
subpostmaster is aware of the anomaly (some are, some aren't).

Can I please have any comments on these asap by midday tomorrow so that they can be sent to the 10 affected
branches tomorrow (10 as we are not writing to the 4 Crowns also affected).

Once we have your comments, Andy Parsons from Bond Dickinson will liaise with Andy Winn to tailor each letter to
the specific circumstances of the individual branch.

Before they are sent, Legal need to do a final cross check of the intended recipients to make sure they are not the
subject of any prosecutions / investigations. Can someone please let me have the list of intended recipients asap.

Kind regards, Rodric
