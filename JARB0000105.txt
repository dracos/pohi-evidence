Great news about the inquiry. I have written a story this morning about it but I am
interested in doing a more in depth follow-up about what this could mean.

It seems that there are more and more people supporting the subpostmasters’ cause, which
is great.

I will attend the meeting on 03 February, but would like to do an article in preparation for
this.

If James can call me ont. ater for a chat that would be good. No hurry as the
news is done. This will be more on an analysis.
