SV&I Weekly Summary Report
Integration and Test

Overview

With Cycle 1 completed, coverage of those tests planned is in excess of 81%. The pass rate for those
tests run is over 94%. Due to issues with reporting in Test Director, these figures do not include System
Management test coverage. This element will be reported from cycle 2.

The target coverage for this cycle is in excess of 80% with a pass rate in excess of 90% of those tests
run, This is due to the fact that we are not scheduling the majority of Performance and the Regression
Test pack until Cycle 2, in order to get a clear run on a more stable baseline.

Predominantly the areas of testing that have uncovered most faults have been Bureau and Track and
Trace though this is not thought to be cause for concern.

Technical testing has also made good progress. A number of problems have been found with SysMan,
which is our objective to unearth these at an earlier stage in the life cycle. Solaris security testing is
making steady progress.

ETU

The ETU DIT has been a distraction from the Integration testing and we have made a big effort to catch
up. A number of the deferred tests will be run on the support rig to achieve a complete run. First
indications are all-in-all the product is surprisingly good for a first cycle.

Bureau DC

The Bureau File transfer Interface mechanism for Spot rate and margin delivery has been successfully
tested with some minor issues with file access for acknowledgements to the RDMC Host.

Spotrate and Margin validation has gone well though it has exposed a dependency for correct data to be
supplied which has identified a potential lack of robustness in the design/code.

Bureau Counter

In general the BdC Counter transactions are working well, using the correct Spot Rates and
Margin/commission rates. So far the Rate board / Rate report testing has exhibited few problems. Areas
being affected by PinICLs raised are balancing/Cash Account and Bureau Transaction Data
File/Bureau Control Totals file though PinICLs are being progressed.

BTD & BCT Files

There is a problem with the Harvesting of BdC transactions. When this occurs the BTD & BCT Files
are incomplete and cannot be fully proven.

DVLA

All testing complete with a few problems found with SORN ttransactions not being included
on the daily AP summary report, Tax Disc barcodes not being read and Tax Disc barcode
data missing from the receipt and APS file for a session recovery. Other than that testing is
progressing as expected.

NS&I

All processing aspects - screen flows, transaction details, DRS - have been tested with only minor errors
with on-screen messages displayed in failure scenarios.

NBS receipts

The full range of tests were run and has confirmed that the changes are successfully implemented.
DWH

Changes tested so far include the bank analysis reports, which resulted in a few PinICLs for which fixes
have been provided. General regression testing was also successful.

DRS

The DRS area as a whole is performing well. Many PinICLs have been raised on corrupt C4 (E29's) ,
corrupt C112 (E27's) and we were also getting duplicate C4's (E12). Fix's have been delivered and re-
tested successfully.

T&T

For cycle I all tests were run. A number of high priority PinICLs in this area and having the Blitz cycle
helped to raise these at an early stage. A lot of the PinICL's raised are requirements related and missing
POL reference data.

Integration and Test

NS&I DIT - All activities completed FJS end, waiting for sign off by IBM. Fixes for problems
encountered during Certification are being intercepted and it is expected that the DIT will be signed off
when re-test of the Certification script is complete.

e-Pay DIT - Responses for Vodafone cards (189 and 197) introduced in vs 1.13 of the Accreditation
test spec not set up by e-Pay. Fixes have been intercepted and tested, the file outputs are now being
checked and signoff is expected by end of the week.

DVLA DIT - complete. When performing a recovery (system crash) after both the DVLA application
form and tax disc have been scanned only the application form scan remains on the screen. This is an
error in FJS code and a PinICL has been raised. DVLA have confirmed that the file content is correct.

Bureau DIT postponed due to a difference in interpretation of the AIS on the minimum and maximum
commission data fields. It now appears that these fields should accommodate both pounds and pence
values, the AIS and the code were amended accordingly. A fix was delivered but this highlighted a
second problem where characters introduced during the file delivery caused the Margins file to fail
validation. This problem was also fixed and the DIT commenced on the 31/07/03.

Issues

The problem uncovered with the use of Hummingbird v6.1 has been resolved by implementing a
configuration change to handle the truncation of share names which are greater than 8 characters.

A number of Track and Trace requirements issues need resolving.

Problems have been encountered in progressing the V&I rig build mainly due to the data requirements
and distribution to the high number of simulated outlets.
