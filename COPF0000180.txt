Subject: Case v Bashir. GG14024535

Dear Robert

Further to our recent meeting I would be obliged if you would confirm the
following:

Horizon System.

1. Given the publicity surrounding this system, and the likelihood
that the defence will raise this at

trial, please confirm if you are able to provide an expert witness who
can provide an assurance

that there are no difficulties with the Horizon system

2. Please provide a copy of the ‘Second Sight’ report.

3. What is the present position with respect to prosecutions in
England. Have the Crown

Prosecution Service decided not to pursue any further Post Office
embezzlement cases where

there may be issues with respect to the Horizon system?

4. What is the Post Office view with respect to the English cases?
Bashir Case.

1. The variance check print out on 26.2.2014 at 17.35 hours shows that
Joyce Malcolm declared in

the AA system that the cash in hand was £6784.82. On the same day at
19.05 hours Bashir , or

someone using his unique ID, changed the information in the system to
show that the cash in

hand was £51784.82.

How often was the variance checks procedure carriedout?
Why are there no print outs for other days/periods?

Please confirm if you are able to provide print outs for
other periods which would support the
assertion that someone was inflating the cash in had figures.

Are you able to confirm that Bashir was working in the
office on the above date?

Joyce Malcolmson in her statement of 27 March 2013
suggested that Adnan Tariq used Bashir’s
password. Is there any other eviderce supporting this position.

2. Please endeavour to obtain a statement from Betty McCartney with
respect to the issues at the
Toryglen Post Office.

3. Please provide documentary evidence showing the branch trading
statements (Credence) for

each accounting period beginning from the audit on 8 August 2012 to 26
March 2014.

Can these branch trading statements be compared with any variation
checks carried out at the

end of each trading period to show a discrepancy with respectto the
declared cash in hand and

the actual cash in hand.

Are the branch trading statements ‘signed off’ at the end of each trading
period and if so who
signed them off?

4, Please provide schedules for all of the Santander Deposits for
Bashir’s account made at Toryglen
Post Office showing all payments amounting to £554000.00.

5. Please provide a statement from someone at Santander who can
confirm that the Santander

bank card used to make the deposits is associated with Bashir’s Santander
bank account.

6. Please obtain, if available, account opening details for all of the
accused bank accounts. We will
require this to identify Bashir as the person holding these accounts.

Regards

Angus Crawford
