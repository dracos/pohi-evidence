IN THE MATTER OF
THE POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF FUJITSU SERVICES LIMITED
IN RESPONSE TO A RULE 9 REQUEST DATED 29 APRIL 2022

These written submissions are made on behalf of Fujitsu Services Limited (“Fujitsu”) in
response to a request for information provided by the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
(the “Inquiry”) to Fujitsu on 29 April 2022 in accordance with Rule 9 of the Inquiry
Rules 2006, in addition to supplemental requests from the Inquiry by emails dated 24 June
2022, 14 July 2022 and 26 July 2022, (the “Requests”).

The Requests followed disclosure of the following documents by Fujitsu to the Inquiry, all
of which were created in the period 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2000 (the “Relevant
Period’):

a) Data from the PinICL archive;

b) Data from the Peak database; and

c) Data from the “Known Error Log” (“KEL”).
The Requests seek explanations in relation to (i) the classifications used in the PinICL and
KEL databases, what these represented and how they changed over time, (ii) specific
references in PinICLs to “migrations” as the cause of errors identified, (iii) the meaning

and usage of “CAP” numbers in PinICL records, and (iv) different departments within
Fujitsu’s Horizon support teams. These are addressed separately below.

BACKGROUND: PINICL AND PEAK SYSTEMS

4.

5.

PinICL was the customised incident logging and resolution tracking system adopted for
use by ICL Pathway Limited (“ICL Pathway”) to support the Horizon IT system during
the period 1996 to 2003, prior to the introduction of the Peak system in 2003. ICL Pathway
was the entity contracted to deliver the Horizon IT system during this period. Like the
PinICL system, Peak is an incident and release management system and work allocation
tool.

PinICL recorded (amongst other things) incidents:
a) identified by ICL Pathway in test systems;

b) identified by ICL Pathway during routine system monitoring;
FUJ00119556

FUJ00119556

c) raised by Post Office Counters Limited (as it then was), some of which may have
resulted from feedback received from sub-postmasters; and

d) resulting from certain calls made to the Horizon System Helpdesk by sub-
postmasters, which were deemed necessary for escalation through ICL Pathway’s
incident management process.

6. PinICL was also used to record information relating to the release of new software to the
Horizon IT system.

7. Each item logged on the PinICL system is referred to as a PinICL (collectively,
“PinICLs”).

8. In the Inquiry’s email dated 24 June 2022, it was noted that some of the data disclosed by
Fujitsu from the Peak database appeared to be duplicative of data contained in the PinICL
archive, which had already been disclosed. Fujitsu understands that, while PinICLs that
were still open when the Peak system was introduced in 2003 were migrated to the Peak
system, it appears that some of these records have also been maintained in the PinICL
archive. Fujitsu has identified approximately 13,442 documents disclosed to the Inquiry
which appear to have been maintained in both the PinICL archive and the live Peak
database. Details of these documents are set out in the “Schedule of PinICL and PEAK
Versions” (FSL 01/1).

9. Where records have been maintained in both the PinICL archive and Peak database, Fujitsu
suggests that the Inquiry refers to the version extracted from the Peak database. This is
because:

a) Peak is a live database, still currently in use, and will therefore capture any updates
to the equivalent PinICL record between the time the record was migrated and the
date on which the Peak database was extracted for the purposes of the Inquiry; and

b) records extracted from the Peak database also contain their attachments as family
member documents, where available. No such attachments are readily available in
relation to records held in the PinICL archive.

PINICL CLASSIFICATIONS
...Please can you provide an explanation of the following...The classifications that are used
in the PinICLs, such as the call type codings, category codings, priority definitions, defect

cause codings and target releases.

10. The classifications used historically in the PinICL database are set out in the following
documents, copies of which are enclosed with these submissions:

a) “PinICL Reference Data Guides” (FSL 01/2 and FSL 01/3);

b) “PinICL Training Manuals” (FSL 01/4 and FSL 01/5);
FUJ00119556

FUJ00119556

c) “PinICL Incident and Problem Management” process documents (FSL 01/6 to
FSL 01/8); and

d) an “End to End Support” process document (FSL 01/9).

11. Further detail is also provided in an earlier draft of the PinICL Reference Data Guide
entitled “PinICL User Guide” (FSL 01/10).

12. In order to assist the Inquiry’s reading of the documents and to demonstrate how the
classifications listed in the Requests changed over time, enclosed with these submissions
are the following:

a) Appendix A to these submissions is a table setting out extracts from relevant
sections of a number of the documents referred to above (see Table 1 of
Appendix A). This table should be read in conjunction with the contemporaneous
documents in full;

b) Table 2 of Appendix A is a summary of information drawn from the PinICL records
themselves as at 8 November 2002, which Fujitsu has prepared to supplement the
information in Table 1 of Appendix A; and

c) a“Schedule of PinICL Classifications” (FSL 01/11), further information in relation
to which is set out below.

Please provide a comprehensive record of what the following PinICL codes represented at
different points in time...

13. In addition to the information set out in Table 1 of Appendix A to these submissions, the
Requests seek a comprehensive record of the meaning of certain PinICL classifications
over time and the dates for which those meanings were valid. Fujitsu’s response for each
of the PinICL codes specified in the Requests is set out below.

«+-Call Type (AKA Type Coding)...

14. Fujitsu does not believe that a central history of Call Type definitions exists. This is because
(i) Fujitsu understands the table in PinICL which contained the Call Type definition was
over-written upon cach amendment to the definition, and (ii) the progress text recorded
against each PinICL (i.e. the user readable history) does not record the Call Type
description, simply the identifying letter.

15. For completeness, and to assist the Inquiry, a table of the single available archive for Call
Type definitions is set out in the “Call Type” tab of the Schedule of PinICL Classifications
(FSL O1/11).

...Response Category (AKA Category Coding)...

16. Similarly, Fujitsu understands that Response Category definitions were overwritten in the
relevant table in PinICL when they were amended. However, for this classification, the text
FUJ00119556

FUJ00119556

of each definition was re-produced in full in the PinICL progress text. In order to assist the
Inquiry, Fujitsu has parsed the progress text and identified instances when Response
Category definitions appeared to change.

. As noted in Section 15 of the PinICL Incident Management Process (FSL 01/8), Response

Categories vary according to Call Type. The “Response Category” tab of the Schedule of
PinICL Classifications (FSL 01/11) sets out, (i) the numerical value used for each of the
Response Categories, (ii) the text definition of those values, (iii) which Call Type each
definition was attributable to, and (iv) the first and last known dates these definitions appear
to have been used.

«+-Call Priority (AKA Priority Definitions)...

18.

As with the Call Type definitions, Fujitsu understands the table containing Call Priority
definitions was overwritten upon each amendment and the progress text recorded against
each PinICL included only the alphabetical identifier.

. However, the progress text does record the relevant “Target Date” each time a Call Priority

was entered. Fujitsu has therefore parsed the system calculated Target Date from the
progress text and, in order to assist the Inquiry in relation to the Requests, set out the raw
PinICL data relevant to Call Priorities (FSL 01/12). Fujitsu produced this data by, (i) taking
the first Target Date from the progress text of each PinICL, (ii) comparing this to the
timestamp that the relevant progress entry was created (Column D), and (iii) extracting the
difference in hours (Column H). Column H aims to illustrate the definition of the Call
Priorities attributable to each relevant PinICL. Fujitsu understands that PinICL did not
include non-working days in Target Date calculations.

...Defect Cause (AKA Root Cause Analysis).

20.

As with the classifications referred to above, Fujitsu understands that Defect Cause
definitions were overwritten in the relevant table in PinICL when the definitions were
amended. However, as with the Response Category, the text of each Defect Cause
definition was re-produced in full in the PinICL progress text. Fujitsu has therefore parsed
the progress text and identified instances when the Defect Cause definitions changed. The
“Defect Cause” tab of the Schedule of PinICL Classifications (FSL 01/11) sets out the
same information described in respect of the Response Category classification above,
namely (i) the numerical value used for each Defect Cause, (ii) the text definition of those
values, (iii) which Call Type each definition was attributable to, and (iv) the first and last
known dates these definitions appear to have been used.

Please confirm if it is possible to identify from the PinICL or Peak records which of the
sources listed in paragraph 5 of these submissions raised the incident.

21.

Fujitsu notes that the Requests relate to documents created prior to 31 December 2000,
which pre-date the introduction of the Peak system in 2003. These submissions therefore
concern the PinICL system only.
22.

FUJ00119556

FUJ00119556

When an incident was logged in the PinICL system, it would be allocated a Call Type. In
most cases, it would be possible to identify from the Call Type which team raised the
incident and, from that, which of the four sources referred to in paragraph 5 the PinICL
relates to. However, it may not be possible to do this for every PinICL if the incident was
raised by a team which did not have an allocated Call Type value.

Please confirm what “Target Release” indicates and what would cause it to change during
the course of a PinICL.

23.

24

When an incident was logged in the PinICL system, it was also allocated a Target Release
value. Table 1 of Appendix A to these submissions sets out extracts from relevant
documents regarding the Target Release classification, including the following extract
from the PinICL Reference Data Guide (FSL 01/2):

“For Live calls the Target Release field is initially set by a member of the SSC to the release
on which the incident occurred. For all other Call types it is set to the system default of
“Unknown”... As the project moves forward, old Target Release values become redundant
and new values are introduced.”

. Fujitsu understands that the Target Release value was updated throughout the life of a

PinICL if, for example:

a) a defect was identified, in which case the Target Release field was updated to refer
to the current proposed release that was to include the PinICL solution (see the
“PinICL MIS Reporting Requirement”, (FSL 01/13)); or

b) as stated above, old Target Release values became redundant as new releases were
rolled out (see, the PinICL Reference Data Guide, FSL 01/2 and FSL 01/3).

Please provide release dates for the Target Release codes set out in Table 2B of Appendix A.

25.

26.

Table 2B of Appendix A sets out the relevant description for the different Target Release
codes. However, Fujitsu does not hold a central record of historic releases and, accordingly,
the actual release dates of each Target Release listed (if the releases were in fact rolled out)
are not readily available. It may be possible to ascertain the actual release dates through a
manual review of Release PinICLs (as noted in the “Call Type” tab of the Schedule of
PinICL Classifications (FSL 01/11), Call Type R was largely attributable to Release
PinICLs). Fujitsu notes that undertaking such a review would likely take a significant
amount of time, but it would be content to do so, should this assist the Inquiry.

For the Inquiry’s information, the “Target Release” tab of the Schedule of PinICL
Classifications (FSL 01/11) contains information relating to (i) the number of PinICLs
attributable to each Target Release (PinICL Count Column), and (ii) the first and last
known dates the Target Releases are referred to (First and Last Date columns).
FUJ00119556

FUJ00119556

PINICL CONTENT

A number of PinICLs discuss “migrations” as the cause of errors identified. Please provide
information regarding when a migration would be carried out.

27. Fujitsu respectfully notes that it has not had reference to specific PinICLs of the type
described by the Inquiry in this aspect of the Requests and, as far as Fujitsu is aware, the
word “migration” did not have any one specific meaning during the Relevant Period.
However, Fujitsu understands that the use of “migration” in PinICLs could refer to the
following:

a) branches moving to the Horizon IT system from previous systems during the pilots
and national rollout of the Horizon IT system. An example of the data migration
that took place when some branches moved to the Horizon IT system is set out in
the document entitled “In Office Data Migration - CSR+” (FSL 01/14); or

b) the release of new or updated software, for example to add functionality to the
Horizon IT system or in response to incidents recorded in the PinICL system, as set
out in the “Pathway Release Policy” (FSL 01/15).

References in the PinICLs to “CAP”, meaning Cash Accounting Period, often have a
number associated with them, for example “CAP 25”. Please explain what these numbers
represent, whether they are universal and, if so, provide a calendar that translates the
numbers to relevant reporting periods.

28. Fujitsu understands that, during the Relevant Period, Post Office branches operated on a
weekly trading period (the “Cash Accounting Period” or “CAP”). The CAP numbers set
out in a number of PinICL records represent the relevant weekly trading period within the
financial year. As set out in the “Explanation of Local P.O Reconciliation and
Administration” (FSL 01/16), these numbers were used universally by all branches, and
their usage and calendar was set by Post Office Counters Limited. Fujitsu has enclosed
with these submissions contemporancous calendars of the CAP numbers used for the year
1999 (FSL 01/17 — 23).

29. Fujitsu notes that the “CAP” abbreviation was also used in reference to other terms during
the Relevant Period, such as “Corrective Action Plan” or the CAPs system that was being
developed by the Benefits Agency before they withdrew from the project.

BACKGROUND: KEL

30. The “Known Error Log” was a knowledge management tool used by both ICL Pathway
and Fujitsu to explain how to deal with, or work around, issues that arose in the Horizon
IT system. Each entry in the Known Error Log was referred to as a “KEL” (collectively,
“KELs”). The term “Known Error Log” or “KEL” was replaced in around July 2019 by
the term “Knowledge Base” or “KB”.

31. The content of the KEL database has changed over time, depending on the requirements of
the support units utilising it. For example, if certain systems or services ceased to be
FUJ00119556

FUJ00119556

provided or were otherwise removed from the solution, KELs relating to those systems or
services, which were then no longer relevant, may have been deleted to improve the
functionality of the database. Fujitsu understands that all recoverable KELs for the relevant
period have been provided to the Inquiry and, to the extent any KELs from this period have
not been provided, this is because they are no longer recoverable.

KEL CLASSIFICATIONS

..-Please can you provide an explanation of the following... The classifications that are
used in KELs such as type codings, status definitions and visibility definitions.

32.

33.

34.

36.

Unlike the PinICL database, which was only in place for a limited period of time, KELs
have been in place in various forms for over 20 years. By way of background, until around
July 2006, KELs were stored in a “flat-file” structure consisting of unformatted text files.
From around July 2006 onwards, these KELs were then imported to the KEL database,
which allowed for the KELs to be filtered and searched more easily. Given the passage of
time, there is limited instructive documentation available in relation to KELs prior to this
migration.

Guidance relating to the use of KELs is stored on a Fujitsu internal website for the Software
Support Centre (“SSC”). This website has been in place from at least October 2006. Copies
of the earliest identified “KEL User Guides” from the SSC website can be found at
FSL 01/24 and FSL 01/25. “Notes” and “help” pages from later iterations of the SSC
website also provide information relating to certain of the classifications listed. These
“notes” and “help” pages are enclosed at FSL 01/26 to FSL 01/66.

Pages from the SSC’s current website, providing guidance on how the SSC can create,
update and search the current KB database, are enclosed at FSL 01/67 to FSL 01/71.

. To assist the Inquiry with its review of these pages and to illustrate the development of the

classifications listed in the Requests over time, enclosed at Appendix B to these
submissions are tables setting out extracts from relevant sections of the “notes” and “help”
pages enclosed. As with Appendix A, Appendix B should be read in conjunction with the
contemporaneous documents in full. An index setting out the relevant dates for each of the
“notes” and “help” pages enclosed is also provided in Appendix C.

Given the extensive period that the KEL / KB database has been in place, Fujitsu has not
in the time available been able to identify contemporaneous documents relating to all of
the classifications listed in the Requests. Should Fujitsu identify any further documents
relevant to the Requests, Fujitsu will produce these to the Inquiry by way of supplemental
production.

FUJ00119556

ROLE OF SUPPORT TEAMS

Please explain the respective role of the various departments within Fujitsu’s Horizon
support teams.

37. The table at Appendix D to these submissions refers to contemporaneous documents which
contain explanations regarding the support teams identified by the Inquiry in the Requests,
including (i) relevant extracts from these documents setting out the respective role of each
team, (ii) whether each team constituted the first, second, third or fourth line of support,
and (iii) descriptions of how incidents moved between the various teams. Copies of the
relevant contemporaneous documents are also enclosed with these submissions.

“The Route Cause is specified on the same

routes the Call to another person or team, the
system will insist on being supplied with a

“99 General — Unknown” as a valid value.”

Helpdesk staff will record details of the issue or request by ascertaining
information from the customer regarding the nature and impact of the problem,
the Horizon System Helpdesk operator will be able to resolve or diagnose the

customer.

If the service request call indicates a software problem which has been seen
before, and for which a workaround is not available, the SMC links the current
call to the first call and does not pass the call to the SSC. This ensures that the
SSC does not receive duplicate calls for the same problem.

If the service call indicates a software problem that has not been seen before,
the SMC follows its own internal procedures to pass the call to the SSC,
providing information about the problem and Pathway’s exposure, that is, the

number of calls received and the potential number of counters that are affected.

They also provide details about the software version installed on the platform.

“On receipt of an incident PinICL the SSC investigate the incident. If on
investigation the SSC determine that:
e The incident was incorrectly routed, it is passed backed to the SMC to
route to the appropriate support unit (Section 4.2.1.1).
e = The incident is a business incident, and not system related, it is routed
through to the MSU (Section 4.3.2.1).

Description (and source, where available)

If none of the above apply, the incident is either resolved by the SSC or routed
to 4th line support for resolution. However, a decision first has to be made as to
whether a business incident is associated with the incident being dealt with. If
so, the SSC will raise a new business incident with the HSH (Section 4.1.1).

The SSC raise a KEL for incidents that they have not come across before and
require further work and time before they are resolved. This is then used by the
SMC to stop duplicate incidents being sent through to the SSC.

If a workaround can be developed, it is added to the respective KEL to be used
as required. If the workaround requires agreement from [POL], a Problem is
raised to obtain the agreement.

If the incident cannot be resolved by the SSC, it is passed to 4th line support
(Section 4.4.1) for resolution. If the SSC can resolve the incident, the
appropriate actions are taken until the incident is ready for closure (Section
4.3.1.3).” (Incident Management Process Definition, p.22, FSL 01/75)
