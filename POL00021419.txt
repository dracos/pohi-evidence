Losses are £1m lower than last year at period 6, This reflects no repetition of the two
frauds at Blackwood and Sevenoaks, which totalled £1m last year. In the £25k-£100k
loss range, however, the 13 cases this year are similar to last year. =

Positive action has been taken through Branch Control since last year. This has
reduced the incidence of “suspense accounts’ being abused to conceal fraud.
. “However, there is an increase in the number of losses covered up by inflating cash
figures. IMPACT will in the longer term improve cash MI here, but short'term actiori: 7
