                      POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




           FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF JASON PETER COYNE




I, JASON COYNE, will say as follows:



INTRODUCTION

   1. I am a currently a Partner at Evolution Project Consulting Limited. Evolution

      Project Consulting is a company that assists parties to resolve disputes

      involving technology.

   2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

      (the "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 3rd April

      2023 (the "Request").



BACKGROUND

   3. I have been asked to set out a summary of my professional background.

   4. Since 1981 I have been involved in the programming computers, initially using

      the language, "BASIC" on Sinclair ZX81 and Spectrum computers, before

                                                                                  WITN00210100




   moving to Commodore Vic 20 & 64 computers whilst at School and later

   during college.

5. In 1986 I attended Cardinal Newman College, at Preston where I studied

   Computer Science and statistical mathematics and achieved A levels in both.

6. On leaving college, I started to look at universities to study computing at

   degree level but was disappointed to find that all courses were focused at

   looking back at legacy 1960,1970's computing rather than the emerging

   technologies of modern networked computing that was rapidly accelerating in

   industry in the time (1989). It was on that basis that I took the decision to go

   straight into an industrial placement and secured a position as a computer

   programmer with a company called Exact Abacus which at the time created

   'full business control' systems for small to medium sized companies.

7. During my six years at Exact Abacus, I assisted in the design and

   development of systems in Business Book-Keeping, Accountancy, Stock

   Control, Warehouse Management, Electronic Point of Sale, Credit Card

   Processing, Manufacturing Requirements Planning, Mail Order and

   Distribution.

8. During this time, as well as computer programming, I undertook both

   technology hardware and operating systems implementations.

9. These aspects involved the custom-building of computer servers from

   hardware components (Motherboards, Memory, Disk Controllers, Network

   cards etc) and wide area networking communication architecture such as

   leased and PSTN telephone lines.

                                                                                  WITNO0210100




10. My role then, involved the installation and configuring of multiuser operating

   systems such as SCO Xenix, Unix, Novel, CDOS from 'bare metal' hardware

   into 'green field' sites often with hundreds of networked users and devices.

11. My computer programming skills and experience widened into programming

   languages such as Dataflex and PowerFlex.

12. During my tenure at Exact Abacus, I went on to manage the on-site support

   function for the UK commercial users of the Exact Abacus systems, which

   involved interfacing with the telephone helpdesk operatives and I was also

   part of the on-site engineering team who covered the country to ensure that

   installations continued to operate optimally.

13. Around 1996 I wanted to gain exposure to larger computing systems and took

   a position with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) who had recently won

   the contract to manage the outsourced support function for British Aerospace,

   which became BAE Systems.

14. The role in CSC took me from previously looking at hundreds of users to an

   estate of 15,000 users and hundreds of disparate Computer Aided Design

   (CAD), Manufacturing Control, and Testing systems as well as several 'flight

   critical' systems.

15. Part of my role at CSC was looking at the rationalisation of inter-departmental

   systems, seeking to make cost and efficiency savings by looking across the

   departments to help understand where computer systems and processes may

   have been duplicated, and convergence technologies could be employed to

   make cost and support efficiency savings.

16. During my time at CSC, I used many different operating system technologies

   such as: Solaris, AIX, VMS and WindowsNT. I also used many different

                                                                                   WI TN00210100
                                                                                WITNO0210100




   communication technologies such as; Ethernet, Token Ring, SNA, CATS and

   various Fibre Optic configurations and programming languages such as;

   Oracle Forms, Delphi (Pascal), Visual Basic, Foxpro. I deployed several

   databases such as Informix and Progress, Oracle, Sybase, SQL and Dbase.

17. In 2000 I had the opportunity to be a shareholder in my own company, Best

   Practice Group PLC ("BPG") which I founded with three other shareholders.

   The purpose of BPG was to guide buyers of technology systems through the

   design specification and procurement process of new business technology

   systems and to assist with disputes that may arise during the implementation

   and operation of such systems.

18. The rationale for starting BPG was that we had discovered that many

   technology implementations were seen as being failures due to `misaligned

   expectations' as to what the parties (buyers and suppliers) actually desired.

   There was also, typically, a misunderstanding of the respective roles and

   responsibilities of the parties in the overall technology implementation

   process.

19. BPG assisted buyers to specify, carefully what they desired from a new

   system and more importantly how as buyers they would judge the success of

   the system once it was delivered.

20. BPG also assisted technology companies to communicate what was expected

   from the customers during the implementation process, such as responsibility

   for training, data transformation and the communication of changing

   requirements. It was during these early years at BPG that we started to be

   approached by law firms and parties involved in technical implementations to

   assist in the resolution of ongoing disputes with failing implementations.

21. Whilst I do not recall the initial approach from Weightman Vizards regarding

   Post Office Limited -v- Mrs J Wolstenholme, it is likely that this was around

   the end of 2003 (I will return to this further detail later this statement).

22. I can see from my CV attached to the 21 January 2004 document (the "Initial

   Opinion") (WITN00210101) that I was already a Law Society accredited

   Expert Witness. In the early 2000's the Law society provided an accreditation

   scheme for Expert Witnesses (my number 229 suggested that I was an 'early

   adopter' of the scheme). The Law Society has more recently stopped

   providing this accreditation service.

23. As part of the Law Society accreditation scheme, experts were required to

   have formal vetting.

24. In December 2008 I obtained the Expert Witness Diploma from Cardiff

   University Law School and still to this day feel that I benefited from its

   teachings regarding the roles and responsibilities of an Expert Witness and

   the Civil and Criminal Procedure rules of England and Scotland.

25. In 2009 I sold my shareholding in BPG and shortly afterwards became a

   shareholder in IT Group UK limited ("ITG"). ITG focused exclusively on

   dispute resolution, typically by way of Expert Witness instructions from Law

   Firms and around 2010 (if I recall the date correctly) ITG was approached by

   Lee Castleton's family and held one informal meeting with his father but was

   unable to assist him with his matter as, at the time, ITG would only accept

   Expert Witness instructions from a Law Firm and Mr Castleton was

   unrepresented.

26. In 2016 ITG was instructed by James Hartley of Freeth's to provide Expert

   Witness services in the Bates â€”v- Post Office matter.

                                                                                     WITNO0210100




   27. ITG was acquired by Blackrock Expert Services in 2018. Blackrock Expert

      Services was then acquired by Kroll Associates in 2020. I continued to be

      employed in largely the same role by these organisations until April 2023.

   28. From 2000, as part of BPG and after 2009 for ITG, to the present day, I have

      investigated hundreds of failed or failing computer system implementations

      and have provided written opinions and oral testimony on several occasions in

      civil, criminal, and international arbitration matters. The instructions are

      broadly balanced between technology implementors (including many of the

      technology companies) and technology purchasers (including large UK

      governmental agencies including the MOD and many Local authorities).

   29. I am a member of the Academy of Experts, the British Computer Society and

      the Society for Computers and Law.


Post Office Limited -v- Mrs J Wolstenholme

   30. Regarding Post Office Limited -v- Mrs J Wolstenholme, I have been asked

      how I first became involved in these proceedings.

   31. I no longer have any access to any emails or have a copy of the instructions

      from Weightmans Vizards but from speaking to BPG I have been able to

      obtain a copy of my Initial Opinion dated 21 January 2004, (WITN00210101)

      exhibited to this witness statement as well as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet

      (WITN00210102) that I created to assist me in the analysis of the helpdesk

      call logs provided to me. I have been unable to locate the copies of the

      helpdesk call logs provided to me that would have been with the instructions.

   32. I estimate that it was towards the end of 2003 when I was approached by

      Susanne Helliwell of Weightman Vizards. It is likely (but I can't be sure) that

      by 2003 I had already undertaken other unrelated instructions from

                                      Page 6 of 17
                                                                                       WITNO0210100
                                                                                    WITNO0210100




   Weightmans Vizards, I have certainly been instructed by that firm on

   unrelated matters since.

33. I have been asked what my knowledge of the Horizon System was (including

   from any press reporting) prior to my involvement in this matter. I do not recall

   any prior knowledge of the Horizon System at the time of the instruction.

34. Whilst I do not have a copy of the actual instruction provided at the time, I can

   see from the Initial Opinion that the matter concerned Blackpool County

   Court, Claim number CR101947.

35. I can see that in the covering email to the Initial Opinion I said, "Please find

   enclosed my brief note after reviewing the papers in the above matter" and in

   the introduction section; "I do not consider that I am required at this stage to

   produce a full expert witness report as such, and have therefore set out my

   initial opinions in the format below". This statement, and the way that the

   document is presented is consistent with my understanding that this Initial

   Opinion was a draft opinion and that my instructions from the parties may

   have been expected to develop over time as more relevant material was

   disclosed and as my understanding developed over time as a result.

36. The Initial Opinion states that it was a joint instruction (i.e. whilst I was

   communicating with Ms Helliwell, the instruction was from both Post Office

   Limited & Mrs J Wolstenholme). I was expressly requested to "make initial

   observations that would be of value to the court" and I can see that my

   communications also were carbon copied to Mrs Wolstenholme.

37. I can see from WITNO4600203 that it was suggested that "A Court Order was

   made on 19th February 2003 that a computer expert examine the equipment".

   Until this document was provided to me by the Inquiry, I don't believe that I


                                     Page 7 of 17
                                                                                      WI TN00210100
                                                                                 WITNO0210100




   was aware of this Court Order. I can see from WITN04600203 that Post Office

   was taking steps to overturn this Court Order.

38. It appears from the documents that I have been provided with that Post Office

   did not want the Horizon Terminal to be examined and I don't recall any

   equipment being provided to me, nor do I recall visiting the Post Office branch

   to examine the equipment. The document WITN04600203 states that as of

   14th February "The equipment was not examined as part of the Expert's

   review".

39. In January 2004 I would have been familiar with the Joint Expert Instruction

   process and the need to ensure that both parties got the opportunity to

   provide me with information (as the Joint Expert) which each party felt was

   relevant to the proceedings. I was also aware of the need to ensure that both

   parties were copied in my communications with the other party.

40. I recall having a telephone conversation with Mrs Wolstenholme about her

   experience of using the Horizon System and having telephone discussions

   with Ms Helliwell of Weightman Vizards. I do not believe that I had any

   discussions with either Post Office or Fujitsu directly and I did not have sight

   of documents WITN04600203 and WITN04600206 until these were provided

   by the Inquiry.

41. From the observations that I made in the Initial Opinion I can see that I was

   asked to opine if Mrs Wolstenholme's use of the helpdesk was 'reasonable'. I

   concluded that to answer this question fully that I would need comparative

   documents from other Post Office branches, but I can see that I was told that

   this was not possible due to; "...such logs not being available".

                                                                                  WITNO0210100




42. FUJ00121535 (my document) and WITN04600203 (which I had not seen at

   the time) show that comparative help desk calls were extracted from other

   Post Office branches and whilst I had requested these, they were not

   provided to me.

43. I can see I was provided with the following documents:

       1. Claim form dated 19 April 2001 and amended Particulars of Claim

           dated 17 February 2003;

       2. Amended Defence and Counterclaim dated 14 April 2003;

       3. Reply and Defence to Counterclaim;

       4. Order dated 6 October 2003;

       5. Claimant's List of Documents;

       6. Defendant's List of Documents;

       7. Claimant's witness statement;

       8. Defendant's witness statement; and

       9. Additional set of call logs disclosed by the Claimant to the Defendant.

44. I recall that the `additional set of call logs disclosed by the Claimant'

   (document 9 above) was a folder of several printouts from the Post Office

   Horizon Helpdesk System regarding circa 90 calls to the helpdesk which I

   reviewed and from which I created an Excel spreadsheet which I called

   `Analysis of the PO logs'. I have exhibited this at (WITN00210102) to this

   witness statement.

45. The analysis that I conducted on the additional set of call logs considered

   whether the purpose of Mrs Wolstenholme's call to the Post Office helpdesk

   was to seek training or alternatively to report a suspected Horizon System




                                    Page 9 of 17

                                                                                     WITNO0210100




   fault and, in addition, if the remedial action prescribed by the Post Office was

   to `reboot' the Horizon Terminal.

46. From my Initial Opinion I can see that I disagreed with the statement of Ms

   Elaine Tagg, the retail network manager of the Post Office, where she stated:

   "Mrs Wolstenholme persisted in telephoning the Horizon System Help Desk in

   relation to any problems which she had with the system generally, these

   problems related to the use and general operation of the system and were not

   technical problems relating to the system." I said that in my opinion this was

   not a true representation on the evidence that I had seen.

47. In support of the above statement, I said that 63 of the calls "...are without

   doubt system related failures."And; "Only 13 could be considered as Mrs

   Wolstenholme calling the wrong support help desk" I went on to report; "The

   majority of the system issues were screen locks, freezes, and blue screen

   errors which are clearly not a fault of Mrs Wolstenholme's making, but most

   probably due to faulty computer hardware software, interfaces or power"

48. I concluded that; "From a computer system installation perspective it is my

   opinion that the technology installed at the Cleveleys sub-post office was

   clearly defective in elements of its hardware, software or interfaces. The

   majority of the errors as noted in the fault logs could not be attributed to being

   of Mrs Wolstenholme's making or operation of the system."

49. I made the following additional observation; "The helpdesk operated by the

   Post Office would seem to be more focused on `closing calls than attempting

   to get to the bottom of the continual recurrence. The instruction to `re-boot'

   would allow a call to be closed as the postmaster could continue to work once

   the system had powered backup.". I note that within the document


                                   Page 10 of 17
                                                                                        WI TN00210100
                                                                                   WITNO0210100




   WITN04600203 is a comment from Fujitsu that "Blue screens and system

   freezes have always been a problem and the stock HSH reply has always

   been to re-boot.". This was consistent with my findings at the time.

50. 1 also reported; "From the 31St of October (starting at call log number

   10253234) there seems to be a number of logs which talk of `large

   discrepancies' in stock figures, trial balances with "all sorts of figures showing

   minus figures" [Call Log 10311359]". At the time, I did not realise the

   significance of such discrepancies.

51. Following my sending of the Initial Opinion (WITN00210101) Weightman

   Vizards sent me the response from Fujitsu (FUJ00121512) and telephoned

   me to discuss its contents. Whilst I can't recall the detail of that conversation,

   the thrust (from my response at FUJ00121535) appears to have been a

   request to see if I was satisfied by the answers provided by Fujitsu and

   whether the contents of the Fujitsu document led me to change my opinion.

52. 1 sent a follow up email on 27 February 2004 (FUJ00121535) stating; "...No

   my opinion, currently, remains as stated in my original note" which was

   followed with my detailed responses to the Fujitsu comments.

53. In addition to the explanation as to why my opinion remained unchanged, I

   suggested where additional investigations may be conducted that could have

   assisted.

      1. With regard to "Transaction handling on rebooting of the Horizon

          Terminal', Fujitsu suggested that the audit data had since been

          deleted. I offered to examine further data if any were to come to light.

          None was ever provided.

                                                                                  WITNO0210100




       2. With regard to the "reasonableness of helpdesk calls", whilst I was

          originally instructed that data had been destroyed, some `unregulated

          records' had now been discovered but only Fujitsu had reviewed these

          and had presented findings in overview. I requested the "raw data" to

          opine myself, but none was provided.

       3. With regard to operators being told to `reboot', I offered to review the

          findings from the `crashdumps' which should have been available, but

          these were not provided, and I can see in WITNO4600206 that Fujitsu

          stated to Post Office that; "It will not be possible to provide the

          `crashdumps' that the Expert refers to since these will have destroyed."

54. After my email of 27th February 2004, I can't recall having any further

   communications with the parties and to this day I'm not sure if my opinions

   were used by the parties.


Post Office Conduct

55. I have been asked my view on how Post Office conducted the proceedings.

   My only contact with Post Office was via Weightmans Vizard.

56. Whilst I had no direct contact with Post Office, I can see from the documents

   provided that Post Office appeared reluctant to examine or accept my

   findings, instead seeking to look to Fujitsu to assist in the creation of an

   alternative position. I note from WITNO4600203 that; "POL are concerned that

   the Expert's opinions (that the system was at fault) might set a precedent

   against future POL prosecutions" and; "Their primary objective is to get the

   equipment returned."

57. Post Office also appears to have a confused view of what is important in this

   particular dispute when it stated; "They want anything! that might indicate that

                                   Page 12 of 17

                                                                                WITN00210100




   Cleverleys was no better or worse than any other 6 Counter Oulets" [sic]. This

   appears to me to suggest Post Office perceived that if a sample of 6 others

   Post Office branches suggest that they are all operating poorly this may assist

   in this dispute.

58. Post Office appeared to have had knowledge that was not disclosed to me as

   part of my instruction, but would have been relevant, for example; "Blue

   screens and system freezes have always been a problem..."

   (WITN04600203).

59. Additionally, it appears that a Known Error Log ("KEL") was raised because of

   Mrs Wolstenholme's calls to the helpdesk (WITN04600206). This KEL was a

   document likely relevant to my investigation. I opined that; "...worrying

   `discrepancies' in audits. This may, or may not be to do with an `upgrade' of

   some of the counters...". WITNO4600206 explains that; "One of the calls that

   he has specifically referenced was closed using a Known Error Log. The

   presence of a KEL clearly indicates that the problems are investigated and

   workarounds provided pending a permanent fix through a system upgrade".

   The KEL was not disclosed to me.

60. Once Post Office (and perhaps Fujitsu) became aware that my Initial Opinion

   was adverse to Post Office's case a suggested course of action was to

   "influence the Expert's opinion by inviting him to Post Office account locations

   and provide him with access to data, records and people who can deal with

   his observations directly' (WITN04600206). Such data and records had been

   requested by me from the outset but were not provided. It appears to me that

   Post Office was only considering disclosure of such material when seeking to

   redress views expressed in the Initial Opinion.

Fujitsu Conduct

61. I have been asked to provide my view of how Fujitsu conducted the

   proceedings. Whilst I did not have any direct contact with Fujitsu, it is quite

   clear that Fujitsu's view of the performance of the Post Office Horizon

   Helpdesk System is through the lens of its commercial contract with Post

   Office, not the view of the Sub Post Masters. This appears to be illustrated by

   a comment in FUJ00121512. The Helpdesk; "...operates under strict

   contractual Service Level Agreements (SLA) covering aspects such as pick-

   up time, first time fix, and time to close. These measures designed to ensure

   that Post Masters receive a quick response to their call and, to the extent

   possible over the `phone, a timely return to normal business operations". This

   appears to reflect a desire by both Post Office and Fujitsu for branches to

   continue trading as quickly as possible which, in itself was not unreasonable

   but was likely to be detrimental to the Sub Postmasters knowledge of the

   ongoing diagnosis of reported Horizon System faults.

62. Fujitsu's responses to my Initial Opinion could be characterised by me as

   claiming; "we disagree with the experts' opinions because we have fulfilled

   our obligation to Post Office". This was not the primary concern of the current

   proceedings nor my Expert Instruction which was to look in isolation at Mrs

   Wolstenholme's Horizon System experience.

63. In the Fujitsu report provided to me at the time, (FUJ00121512) there is the

   statement; "It is worth noting that Fujitsu Services is not aware of similar

   complaints or claims being made from the other Outlets in the above list,


                                  Page 14 of 17
                                                                                      WI TN00210100
                                                                                  WITNO0210100




   some of which have higher call profiles than Cleveleys". From my knowledge

   of the Bates litigation and the more recent press coverage, I am concerned

   that the statement (which may well be factually correct) could be seeking to

   direct focus away from complaints or claims that plainly did exist from Post

   Office branches but which were perhaps not on the specific list of outlets that

   Fujitsu selected for analysis in this table.

64. I am not aware of the result of these proceedings. I do not recall either party

   reported back to me with regard to the outcome, nor can I locate any

   judgement via any open-source information.

65. I have been asked whether anyone at the Post Office or Fujitsu expressed

   any concerns with bugs, errors, or defects in the Horizon System? I do not

   believe that any bugs, errors, or defects were brought to my attention, other

   than what I could see within the narrative from the 90 help desk logs.

66. Looking back today at the table of the 13 branches displayed

   (FUJ00121512), there are many reports of problems with "Hardware",

   "Reference data", "Network", "Cash Account" and "Software". In my

   experience, such reports typically refer to bugs, errors, or defects rather than

   "Advice and Guidance", "Training" and "Operational" which are very different

   categories and are shown in different columns in the Fujitsu table. I do not

   know the date range used for the table but as this table is intended to be

   representative of the wider Horizon System estate, it suggests to me that all

   Sub Postmasters were suffering a high degree of exposure to Horizon System

   issues in aspects of the system that Judge Fraser ruled were likely to have

   had a lasting impact on branch accounts.
