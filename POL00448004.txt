Hi John, David, Claire, Lead and Andrew
I hope my email finds you well?

Please see attached a copy of the June monthly learner progress report. I usually send this week 1 of each
month and have just returned from 2 weeks annual leave.

Its great to see the early progress John and Joyce are making, and great to see Christina nearing
completion too.

Please let me know if you would like to catch up at any time?

Have a great day and speak soon.

Kind regards

Good morning everyone
I hope my email finds you well? ...and just like that we find ourselves in June already.

Please see attached the latest learner progress report for May — all is looking good. John and Joyce now appear on this
report, and it’s excellent to see John has already had module 1 signed off ahead of target.

David, I look forward to catching up with you at 3pm. Keen to hear how everything is also progressing with CCS so that
we don’t end up with a problem with John and Joyce being on programme (particularly Joyce who is Levy funded).

Thanks as always for the continued support, have a great afternoon and I look forward to speaking with you again
soon.

Kind regards

I hope you are well and looking forward to the bank holiday weekend?

Please find attached the latest report for your learners undertaking the Level 4 Counter Fraud Investigator Standard —

Hi John, David, and Claire

I hope you’re well?

«just like that and it’s March already!

Please see attached latest learner progress report for February. Mark is currently on a break in learning, and Christina

is working to revised target dates for modules 9 and 10A. Module 8 is in progress and will hopefully be signed off
soon.

POL00448004

We have started the onboarding process for Joyce, and she should have received our welcome email with application
form and skills scan to complete.

If you do get a last minute confirmation to enable John to also enrol, please let me know asap. We will need a PO
raised for John due to being in Wales.

I sent an email on 29" Feb with the attached contract for services. Please can a timescale be provided for this to be

returned? This will extend the period of the initial contract to support Joyce enrolling, and will last for the next 3
years.

Thanks for the continued support, have a great day and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Hi John, David, and Claire
Please find attached the latest learner progress report for January — all is good and no concerns to raise by the trainer.

I was just wondering how things are progressing for Joyce and John to also enrol onto the Level 4 Counter Fraud
Investigator Standard?

Joyce I just require her email address to add her to the next cohort.
John would be commercially funded due to being in Wales.

Please let me know re John and Joyce as I would like to add them into this next cohort if possible.

Thanks for the continued support, have a great afternoon and speak soon.
