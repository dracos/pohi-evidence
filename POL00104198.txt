Hi Laura,

A conference call at 10 a.m. on Monday 5‘ October fits well with me.

Simon Clarke of counsel will also be in attendance at the meeting on 6'* October 2015.
Although there is clearly some overlap in our knowledge, Simon and I have also dealt
with different issues over the last year or so quite separately, all of which may well be
relevant to the PF’s line of investigation.

Kind regards,

Martin.

Hi Laura.
I have confirmed flights for the meeting with the PF on 6 October 2015.
{arrive in Edinburgh at 0820am, with my return flight departing 1640pm.

Given that time might be tight, is there any chance you could arrange for me to be picked up at the airport
and brought to your office? [t would also be helpful to have a conference call at some point on Monday 5
October 2015 to make sure I have what I need with me.

Kind regards, Rodric

Morning Laura,

6" October appears to be the only date that suits.

Can you confirm e-mails of those who will be attending and I'll get an invite issued for calendars?
Vif ensure the meeting is late morning or early afternoon to accommodate those travelling up.
Thanks,

Thanks for this. I spoke to DSC’s office and happy with the proposal to meet at Crown Office.

Can I leave you to identify a range of possible dates in early October when Post Office Ltd/Cartwright King
are available? I'll relay in turn to DSC and hopefully we can manage to find one that suits everyone.

Laura,

Thanks for getting back to me and for providing the link. I’ve updated DSC’s office and will update as soon
as he gets back to me.

Also, just to clarify something but when you say others should be there at any prospective meeting do you
mean reps from Second Sight also?

I was informed today that the second Second Sight report is publicly available and can be found here:

https:/Awww.scribd.com/fullscreen/262552400?access_key=key-
f3INShrw9boGLrYdmLwx&allow_share=true&escape=false&view_mode=scroll

Or do a Google search if that link does not work.

The Post Office response is not in the public domain and I do not have a copy, although I am told I
will sent a copy.

In any event, I think it is fair to say that things have moved on from the events earlier this year and
indeed from the Panorama programme. The Post Office has asked me to try and set up a meeting
with you, and the Director of Serious casework, if appropriate/possible to discuss where the Post
Office are with Horizon in a legally privileged setting. It is proposed that two solicitors attend — one
in house from the Post Office and another from Cartwright King — who prosecute on behalf of the
Post Office.

1813
POL00104198
POL00104198

What is your view on this proposal? I am happy to discuss things beforehand but my view is that
you require the others’ input to make a fully informed decision about the Post Office cases that are
in the COPFS system.

For your information we can identify 7 cases with COPFS at the moment. 4 have been reported by
the Post Office and 3 by the police as follows:

Post Office cases

HM13003852 against Christine Gourlay who appeared on petition in January 2015 and is with
Lauren MacRoberts

Case against Mr Hussein from Pollockshields Post Office which is with Angus Crawford (may have
marked no pro meantime)

Case against Aktar Bashir from Toryglen Post Office which is with Angus Crawford

Case against Anaum Khan from Winchburgh Post Office which was only reported in July 2015

Police cases

ED14019049 which is a summary case against Saquib Hussan who has a trial fixed for next week
1N15004777 against Holt — not marked yet we understand

DB15002295 against the SPM from Hardgate Post Office who is alleged to have stolen £6,500 from
a customer

I hope that this assists and I look forward to hearing your views on a meeting.

Kind regards
Laura

Subject: Post Office Ltd - Apparent dispute between Post Office Ltd and Second Sight

Good Morning Laura,

IT hope you're well and no doubt unsurprised that I'm getting in touch re Post Office Ltd.

The issue that's arisen is due to operational deputes getting in touch with me to highlight a
publicised dispute between Post Office Ltd and Second Sight following publication of the final
Second Sight report:

http://postandparcel.info/64576/news/the-uks-post-office-responds-to-horizon-report/

In turn I raised this with the Director of Serious Casework for his thoughts.

Unfortunately, we don't know, in the absence of the report and reply, if we require to do make any
changes to our policy/operational approach to prosecutions as a result.

I've been asked therefore to obtain copies of the final report and Post Office Ltd's reply in order that
we can consider what impact, if any, they have on our prosecution of Post Office Ltd cases.

Can these be provided in confidence to me and only for the purpose of inclusion in a minute to the
DSC?
