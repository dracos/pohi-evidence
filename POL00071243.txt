Cath

Please see info below from Julie Welsh. This must have been what was investigated
earlier this year and the spmr told. I will raise an ad hoc request to try and obtain
copies of the checks that have previously been carried out for evidence.

Also attached are the calls from 16/01/04 - 28/04/04 to both the NBSC & HSH against
Fad Code 213 337;

If there's anything further you think I may be able to help with, please give me a call.

Regards
Richard

Copy of E-mail from Julie Weish - Fujitsu

Richard,

I have had a chat with Anne, she used the message store viewing to
investigate this. If you want copies of extracts for the particular

incorrect declarations please submit an ad hoc request requesting this
information. Hope this helps, see below:

NO TRANSACTION DATE AND TIME WAS PROVIDED FOR THIS ACTION USING CURRENT DATE
AND TIME By Anne Chambers at 26-feb-2004 15:16:00 Category 94 - Advice and
guidance given I have checked various things on the system. All the internal
reconciliation checks are ok. Cheques are being handled correctly (except
for 10th Feb when the clerk forgot to cut off the report - but this didn't

cause a discrepancy). Cash declarations look ok, they usually use drawer id
11. Occasionally they have used a different drawer id, this can lead to
amounts apparently doubling on the cash flow report, and should be avoided.
But again it will not cause a discrepancy. Checking the cash transactions on
the system against the declarations shows that they are not working
particularly accurately (i.e. at the end of the day the cash they declare in

the drawer is tens, hundreds or thousands of pounds astray from what has
been recorded on the system). It is possible that they are not accurately
recording all transactions on the system. There is no evidence whatsoever of
any system problem. I've mentioned this outlet to Julie Welsh (Customer
Services) who will try to get POL to follow it up, but in the meantime

please tell the PM that we have investigated and the discrepancies are
caused by the difference between the transactions they have recorded on the
system and the cash they have declared, and are not being caused by the
software or hardware.
Copy of E-mail from Andrew Price to Cath Oglesby

Cath,

When I spoke to the PM at Marine Drive he was unsure what was causing these errors. He
told me that he has been using the slave machine for his rems and I assured him that
wouldn't cause a problem as long as he was attached to the correct stock unit.

The PM thought there would be some errors relating to National Lottery, I phoned the Lottery
team at Transaction Processing who confirmed that there were some errors relating to Lottery,
but for every charge error there was a corresponding claim error, this was due to the lottery
figures been entered on Horizon in the wrong CAP.

PM was also concerned that when entering the lottery figures, it was as though the terminals
were not communicating, but if that was the case the PM would have large number of errors
on every report and product.

The PM sent cash account information to NBSC and it was looked at by Andrew Wise, he

was unable to find any errors. The only amount questioned was a large amount on the cheques
to processing centre which Andrew was able to confirm was a cheque payment for the
purchase of Premium Bonds.

The PM was advised there was nothing more we could do and we suggested he works a
manual system at the side of Horizon to see if any problems were highlighted.

Also when doing the rems the PM should take a snapshot before and after to see if any
problems were occurring when doing a remittance.

Andrew Wise and I both feel that the Horizon system is working properly and we are unable
to help the PM any further

I hope this information helps, please contact me if you want to clarify anything.

Regards
Andrew
