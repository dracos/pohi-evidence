POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF PAUL TOMBLESON

|, PAUL JOHN TOMBLESON, of 15 Canada Square, London E14 5GL say as

follows:

Introduction

1.

| am a Partner in the Forensic practice at KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) specialising in
Forensic Technology. | have led many eDisclosure matters for clients in the

UK and globally since 2005.

The facts in this witness statement are true, complete and accurate to the best
of my knowledge and belief. Where | refer to my beliefs, these beliefs, and my
knowledge contained within this statement, are informed by my colleagues at
KPMG, including in particular KPMG’s Forensic Technology team. | have been
assisted in preparing this witness statement by KPMG’s Office of General

Counsel, advised by Linklaters LLP.

This witness statement has been prepared in response to a request by the Post
Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the “Inquiry”) pursuant to the Inquiry Rules 2006,
dated 31 July 2023 (the “Rule 9 Request”), relating to KPMG’s engagement to
provide eDisclosure services to the Post Office Limited (“POL”) and the three

disclosure issues which have been identified during the Inquiry. We understand

Page 1 of 15
WITNO9960100
WITNO9960100

the Rule 9 Request to be referring to the following topics: (i) search terms;

(ii) family documents; and (iii) deduplication.

. The role of KPMG in the Inquiry is as an eDisclosure provider, supporting POL
to respond to requests related to the Inquiry. This includes taking instruction
from POL’s relevant external solicitors, primarily Herbert Smith Freehills
(‘HSF”). We were engaged by POL in January 2021 and | am the Partner
leading the KPMG team, which comprises approximately 26 people as at the

end of July 2023.

. There are five main components to the eDisclosure services provided to POL

by KPMG:

= Data scoping, collection and migration;

= Data preparation;

= Data processing;

= Review and hosting using Forensic Technology Tools; and

= Disclosure.

. As at the end of July 2023, KPMG hosts over 29 Terabytes of data for POL
across 19 workspaces in a database called Relativity (the “Relativity
eDisclosure Database”). There are four main workspaces related to the

Horizon IT Inquiry containing approximately 60 million individual documents.

The events which led to the three disclosure issues

7. | became aware of the late disclosure to the Inquiry of a document from reports
in the media. This document was entitled ‘Appendix 6 — Identification Codes’
(‘Appendix 6”) (an example of Appendix 6 is Inquiry URN POL00115674). Mr
Foat, POL’s General Counsel, gave evidence on the three disclosure issues on
4 July 2023. KPMG was not involved in providing information to support Mr

Foat's witness statement dated 21 June 2023 or his oral evidence.

8. At POL’s request, we conducted an internal KPMG review (the “Internal
Review’) into the events that led to the disclosure issues and this included a
review of the circumstances around the delayed discovery and disclosure of

Appendix 6 to the Inquiry.

9. In the following sections, | address each of the three issues.

Search terms

10. It is commonplace for search terms and keywords to be used in eDisclosure to
narrow down the population of documents requiring review. Documents that

contain a search term are referred to as responsive documents or ‘hits’.

11. Typically, on receipt of a new request from the Inquiry, HSF notifies KPMG and
provides search instructions (which include the data sources, custodians, date
ranges, search terms and other search criteria). KPMG has not had any
involvement in the development of the search criteria or search terms arising

from a request, aside from providing ad hoc technical assistance with the

Page 3 of 15

WITNO9960100

searching and Boolean logic to be deployed in Relativity. Boolean logic is a
way of structuring searches using different operators (e.g., AND, OR) to get the

most precise results.

12.\n certain instances, Appendix 6 is in a family group of documents with the
document ‘Appendix 3 — Guide to the Preparation and Layout of Investigation
Red Label Case Files. Offender reports & Discipline reports’ (“Appendix 3”)
(an example of Appendix 3 is Inquiry URN POL00038452). | understand from
Mr Foat's witness statement of 21 June 2023 that Appendix 3 and Appendix 6
are documents that appear to be related to the Inquiry’s requests 11 (“R9(11)”)

and 14 (“R9(14)’).

13.Based on the findings from our Internal Review, | can confirm that Appendix 6
was not responsive to the search terms prepared by HSF for R9(11), dated 28

February 2022.

14. However, Appendix 3 was responsive to three identical R9(11) searches which
HSF instructed KPMG to deploy in March / April 2022, resulting in 19 versions
of Appendix 3 being reviewed and tagged by HSF between 28 March and 16

May 2022.

15.1 note that neither Appendix 3 nor Appendix 6 appears to have been responsive
to the initial search terms developed by HSF in 2022 for R9(14), dated 15 June

2022.

16.To the best of my recollection, KPMG has not had any conversations with POL
about search terms to be applied on specific requests. KPMG’s instructions

came from POL’s external solicitors only.

Family documents

17.Many documents that are hosted in the Relativity eDisclosure Database are
part of a family. A parent-child relationship exists for those document families.

For instance, an email (the parent) with an attachment (the child).

18. Typically, search terms will identify one or more individual documents that are
part of a family, but not every family member. Using the example above, the
attachment to the email may be responsive to the search terms whilst the parent

email is not.

19.In the vast majority of cases, the instructions that KPMG has received (prior to
recent changes following the identification of the disclosure issues) were to
provide only the responsive documents for review, i.e., only those members of
a family with a direct search hit. This means that the reviewer only had to make
a decision on a specific document responsive to the search terms, albeit a

reviewer always had the ability to examine family documents in Relativity.

20.1 am not aware of POL’s instructions to its external solicitors regarding the

review of families of documents.

21.All 19 versions of Appendix 3 referred to in paragraph 14 were responsive to
search terms. These responsive documents were reviewed by HSF and given

a relevance decision.

WITNO9960100

22.Eight of the 19 versions of Appendix 3 were in the same family group as
Appendix 6. None of the family documents for these eight were reviewed (until

May 2023).

23.To the best of my recollection, KPMG has not had any conversations with POL
about the review of family documents. KPMG’s instructions came from POL’s

external solicitors only.

Deduplication

24.KPMG is hosting a wide variety of data from many different data sources in the
Relativity eDisclosure Database. This includes email data from various
individuals’ mailboxes, SharePoint files, CDs, backup tapes and hard copy
scanned documentation. Within this data set are a significant number of

duplicates.

25.From a Forensic Technology perspective, duplicate documents are those with
the same MD5 Hash algorithm (“MD5#’) number. The purpose of an MD5#
number for documents is to provide a unique and fixed-size fingerprint, in the
form of a 32-digit hexadecimal number string, that represents the content of the
document. It is commonly used for detecting when changes have occurred to

a document.

26.Deduplication based on MD5# numbers is an important eDisclosure technique
to reduce the number of documents prior to review. It is possible to deduplicate
at an individual document level (“item level deduplication”) or at a document

family level (“family level deduplication’).

Page 6 of 15
WITNO9960100
WITNO9960100

27.1 have provided an example below of each form of deduplication based on five
document families (Family 1-5). Four of the document families have a different
parent email (Family 4 and 5 have the same parent email). All five families
contain the same Attachment 1, four families contain the same Attachment 2,
three families contain the same Attachment 3, and two families contain the

same Attachment 4.

28.In this example, search terms are run across the data set and only Attachment
1 (highlighted in red) is responsive to those terms. Therefore, there are five
responsive documents across the data set, since Attachment 1 is a child in

every family.

Table 1: Deduplication example

Family 1 Family 2 Family 3 Family 4 Family 5

Email 1 Email 2 Email 3 Email 4 Email 4

Attachment 1 | Attachment 1 | Attachment 1 | Attachment 1 | Attachment 1

Attachment 2 | Attachment 2 | Attachment 2 | Attachment 2

Attachment 3 | Attachment 3 | Attachment 3

Attachment 4 | Attachment 4

29.KPMG is routinely asked by POL’s external solicitors to report statistics on the
number of hits and (in some cases) the number of hits and families. In the

example above, there are five hits and 19 hits with full families.

Page 7 of 15
WITNO9960100
WITNO9960100

30. If family level deduplication was applied across the dataset, the MD5# of the
document families is compared and duplicates are removed. Since two families
are identical (Family 4 and 5), after family level deduplication there would be

four families and 14 documents remaining in the data set for review.

31.If item level deduplication was applied across the hits, the MD5# of the
responsive items (i.e., Attachment 1) is compared and duplicates are removed.
Since all five versions of Attachment 1 are identical, after item level
deduplication there would be only one version of Attachment 1 (and its family)

promoted for review.

32.1n this example of item level deduplication, it is important to understand which
version of Attachment 1 is deemed to be the ‘master’ and which four versions
are deemed to be ‘duplicates’, since four of the five families are different. If the
version of Attachment 1 in Family 1 is deemed to be the master, this document
(and its family) will be promoted for review. However, the reviewer would not
see Family 2, 3, 4 and 5 since they contain duplicate versions of Attachment 1,

even though their families are different.

33.KPMG uses a Relativity ‘Update Duplicate Status’ script as the basis for item
level deduplication using MD5# values. The script tags documents as either
master, unique or duplicate in order to filter out duplicates and pass only master
and unique documents, and their families, for review. There are a variety of
different ways to sort duplicates but the default setting is to use Artifact ID
(Artifact ID is a metadata field populated by Relativity when a document is
loaded into a new workspace). Hence, the first document loaded in the

workspace becomes the master.

34.A summary of the number of documents requiring review based on the above

example is as follows:

Review of responsive 4 1

35. There are risks and implications from both types of deduplication technique,

with the main difference being the trade-off between the number of documents

requiring review versus having the context from the review of full families.

36.As noted in paragraph 19 above, HSF’s review strategy appears to have been

primarily focussed on responsive documents and not their full families. We

understand that this was in an effort to identify a review population that was

reasonable to review within the timescales required by the Inquiry.

37.1In line with this approach, where deemed necessary, HSF has instructed us to

deduplicate between responsive documents using MD5#, i.e., item level

deduplication. We therefore undertook deduplication at a responsive document

Page 9 of 15
WITNO9960100
WITNO9960100

level, rather than a family level, to reduce the number of documents requiring

review.

38.Deduplication has not been applied as standard, but only on certain requests
or sub-questions of requests, when instructed to do so by POL’s external
solicitors. MD5# item level deduplication first took place in relation to request

10 (“R9(10)”) to assist HSF to reduce the number of hits requiring review.

39. Based on the findings from our Internal Review, in relation to the three identical
R9(11) searches that KPMG ran and the 19 versions of Appendix 3 reviewed

in March, April and May 2022:

«The first search was run on 25 March 2022. 16 versions of Appendix 3
were responsive to the search terms. Item level deduplication was
instructed to be applied to these documents and nine duplicate versions
of Appendix 3 were removed before review. The seven remaining
versions of Appendix 3 each had a different MD5# and were selected as
having master status based on the earliest Artifact ID (as described in
paragraph 33 above). These seven versions were provided to HSF for
review and tagged as ‘not relevant’ on 28 March 2022. These seven
versions comprised five standalone documents and two families. The
two families were partially reviewed by HSF, but neither of the two

families contained Appendix 6.

= The second search was run on 5 April 2022. The same 16 versions of
Appendix 3 were responsive to the search terms as the first search. No

item level deduplication was instructed for these documents and,

Page 10 of 15
WITNO9960100
WITNO9960100

therefore, the nine unreviewed documents (that were removed as

duplicates in the first search) were provided to HSF for review:

Eight versions of Appendix 3 were tagged as ‘not relevant’ by HSF on
8 April 2022. HSF did not review the families of these responsive
documents at that time. These eight versions were in the same family
as Appendix 6 and thus Appendix 6 was available for review in

Relativity as described in paragraph 19 above; and

The ninth version of Appendix 3 was tagged as ‘relevant’ by HSF on 9
April 2022. HSF did not review the family of this responsive document

at that time. This version was not in the same family as Appendix 6.

* The third search was run on 11 May 2022. This search was run following
rectification of an issue that had arisen during the migration of a
database of documents to KPMG from a previous eDisclosure service
provider to POL. A further 21 versions of Appendix 3 were responsive
to this rerun search, 14 of which were in the same family group of
documents as Appendix 6. In line with the March 2022 search
instructions from HSF, deduplication was applied (based on the earliest

Artifact ID):

18 versions of Appendix 3 were not made available for review by HSF
as they were MD5# item-level duplicates of versions already reviewed

by HSF in March and April 2022; and

Page 11 of 15
WITNO9960100
WITNO9960100

Three versions of Appendix 3 were provided to HSF for review and
tagged as ‘not relevant’ on 16 May 2022. All three versions were

standalone documents without associated families.

40.To the best of my recollection, KPMG has not had any conversations with POL
about deduplication techniques. KPMG’s instructions came from POL’s

external solicitors only.

What steps have been taken to remediate the issues

41.KPMG is providing significant support to POL and its external solicitors with the

ongoing remediation exercise.

42.We have identified the specific searches and related Inquiry requests where

item level deduplication took place. We have identified 11 affected requests.

43.We are helping, under the instruction of HSF, to identify, provide for review and

produce additional documents to the Inquiry related to:

= The ‘Policy Review’ Searches Remediation and Assurance
workstreams: Considering any ‘gaps’ in search terms previously used

and applying additional keywords across certain data sets;

= The Families Remediation workstream: The review of all unreviewed

and / or unproduced families of documents already produced; and

* The Deduplication Remediation workstream: The review of families of

duplicates of documents already produced.

Systems and processes in place to avoid future issues of a similar nature

44. The specific circumstances that led to the late disclosure of Appendix 6, based
on our Internal Review, are set out above and primarily relate to search terms

and review of family items.

45.We are continuing to support POL’s external solicitors to apply search terms
and search criteria across the Relativity eDisclosure Database, but we are not

involved in their development.

46.We are providing POL’s external solicitors with responsive items and their full

families for review, and we will continue to do so unless instructed otherwise.

47.1 also recognise that there are risks and implications from the selection of a
deduplication technique, as the example in paragraphs 27 to 35 above shows.
Since 21 June 2023, HSF has instructed KPMG to only use family level
deduplication, and not item level deduplication. In line with these instructions,
we have not performed item level deduplication since this date. Any
deduplication going forwards will continue to be in line with the instructions of

POL’s external solicitors.
