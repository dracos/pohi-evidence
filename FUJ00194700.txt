Subject: Support for Bramble - Super User Paper

Steve

I have approval to employ Gareth ASAP to write the response to the Super User issue Torstein discussed with him last
week (Gareth confirmed some availability this week to start the work before Torstein’s return from leave). Ken is due
to submit the CT so I will get a fast signature and cover for a few days of Gareth’s time.

I understand Torstein has discussed this with Andy Thomas who can brief Gareth.

Chris: Can we add Gareth and Andy Thomas to our approved list to see the document (Andy will probably need to
show Gareth a printed version).

Thanks

Pete
