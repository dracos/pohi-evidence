Dear Charles ,

Thank you for your prompt reply . I do appreciate this is an adjustment of the rules and we may
receive some flak from the more belligerent Post Masters . However , it makes sense in terms of
strengthening the accumulated knowledge and experience of the Board . Thank you for your
support. It is important we take our shareholders with us .

Best ,

Henry

I work flexibly — so whilst it suits me to email outside of normal working hours, I do not expect a
response during that time.

Dear Henry
Many thanks indeed for your time yesterday afternoon.

You asked me to reflect on your proposal for a staggered roll off of postmaster NEDs. I think this

makes strong logical sense. I have discussed again with Lorna this morning and I believe we are all in
agreement that putting in place a staggered roll off is the appropriate action to take.

Many thanks

Dear Henry

I hope all well. I wonder whether we might be able to have a quick call this week? There are a couple
of things it would be really helpful to touch on if you could spare a moment.

1am copying in who could help on fixing up.

Many thanks indeed
Charles
