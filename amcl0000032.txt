sw And out put them...

AM + (Inaudible) we started doing was, instead of putting anything in at all,
we kept those with the foiis from the iunch iime session on the clip. So
in other words, we took this decision some time ago because of the

— confusion there was over it, the totals. Um.....the foils were only taken
out and corrected that way, nothing was put in, so we decided that this
was the procedure we'll use from that point on. So in other words, if
there’s foils that physically aren‘t there at all in the system...

sw Mmmm,

AM ..are in, in correctly. Or if it’s a few pence, it’s still taken out and it’s
not physically put back in till that run. It’s kept for the next afternoon's
run,

sw Yes, okay.

AM So, things are only taken out. So it’s a removals.

sw Right, so, if you came across a pension and there was a foil. I say,
fifty pounds and it was indicated on your print out that you should have

it,
but you don’t have the foil.

AM Take it out of the run. [f] find ] have a foil for fifty pounds, and it’s

Sw If you don’t have it in the bundle.

just to show up as an over

sw So we go back to where we were, and we were at the balance. Never
teally Jooked at the entries.

AM Em em. _

sw And repeated 311 and remember [ asked you to explain the 3 areas that
have bee discovered on the P2311 you couldn't offer any explanation.

AM Oh they said that the procedure that ] follow and have followed, my last
assumption was that that was correct and should account for anything
taken out of system or put onto the system, that’s all I can say. And I
can see that if you don’t, well it’s to do with the pressure um of
cortecting and entering things under the system that those things should
be exactly the same. They should balance each other out.

sw Em em.

AM Now that is the way the procedure operates, it should operate.

sw Em em.

AM All Ucan say is it clearly hasn’t, this has not happened. And, there are
values entered there which are from other foils. It's whether they were
in other groups or they were corrections or they were held over for re~
entry. Um, | would say that that’s the area er where they come from and
clearly if they’re not there they shouldn't be in.

the first amount which was in the group 7. and it may have been a

it’s been marked out I. It’s a further item in a group 13 showing a

AM (inaudible)

FT So, it (inaudible) your theory a little bit that a reversal was carried out

—_ --—froin another group?

AM No it's my suggestion that um, one possible explanation for removals is
reversal or are the foils may have whatever on it.

FT So there, there is no item?

AM Yeah.

FT If you'd like to check this listing there is no item in there for 2 hundred
and 6 pounds and 60 pence other than 17 shown under the title of group
7 and that is the amount shown on the add listing which company would
have voided the foils. There is no other item for 2 hundred and 6
pounds and 60 removed from any other group.

AM Right.

Sw Or indicate to be removed from any of the group when in fact, there is
no other value, no other group contains the value of 2 hundred and 6
pounds and 60 pence. So it hasn't been put in the wrong group or the
incorrect group, and then taken out. It’s been put in additionally into the
group 7s.

AM Yeah.

FT And so what are your thoughts?

AM Em, I’m getting (inaudible) out, [ would have said well there must be a

require of a Sub-Postmaster is that he on a weekly basis produces a true
and accurate account of all the cash, stock and transactions completed
during the accounting week for your particular office, in this particular
case, you've failed. And the Post Office accepted as being a true record.
AM Hm, hm.

FT Now the discrepancies in this account are that the cash figure may have
rr been adjusted prior to the final balance being produced,

AM Hm.

FT We've identified a number of irregularities in the value of paid Pension
Allowances which were identified this week and as you've said they’ ve
occurred on previous weeks as well. So two elements of the account,
one the value of Pension Allowances paid is inaccurate. and two, the
value of cash on hand, which is shown in Table 5 of your cash account,
has on occasions been inaccurate because it’s either been increased or
reduced to show an accurate balance. and in fact last night’s account,
AM Hm.

FT We have there clear evidence of that that the amount of money that was
recorded by a member of your staff was adjusted prior to it being
declared in the cash account,

AM Hm, hm.
And the amount that you declared was...£600 and er £64,123.68 where

as in reality it was a large amount of cash which was counted by a
member of staff but it had been adjusted, it was adjusted by the value of
about £660 and we’ ve also demonstrated that the Pension Allowance
foils claimed in your account which is shown as £215,034.60 was also
in, inclu, er inflated by a value of £381.60. So in one account we have

AM They would have made up any erm discrepancies, yeah.

SW And you were aware that this was a criminal offence because it was
falsifying accounts?

AM I wasn’t that - I never thought about that or erm put it in those terms at

3:20 all. No I wasn’t - as aware of that, I weren’t as aware of that (inaudible
-noise)

sw You were aware that it was wrong to do that? (Pause)

AM (sighs) I was aware that erm what | thought was if not unaccepted but a
common practice to keep reasonable accounts erm...was in danger of
carrying a pattern which could not be understood or explained in terms
of the original motivation for it.

sw So you were, you were aware that you were falsifying your accounts?

AM (Pause) Not - I wouldn’t have set out to do that in that form or, or, or
with that intention or plan but...as it were that by allowing this kind of
pattern to go on the, the, the final accounting probably would not be
completely accurate.

sw And the reason you have been falsifying the accounts... was because of
shortages? (Pause)

AM Any overages which resulted from those cash accounts were used for
any shortages which resuited cause we had a lot or problems with staff
at a particular point, which, timing of which erm coincides with this,
this pattern. I had alot of problems with my erm...figures in the office.
These were two staff, they were both erm dismissed.

sw And J just want to clarify with you. did you keep a record anywhere of
the discrepancies that you were making?

5:10 AM Not that I know (inaudible)

FT Most points that erm we, we need to cover at this point. Enn we will be
doing further checks. We have to submit an application to the Horizon
Data Warehouse,

AM Yeah.

FT ~~~} To get certain reports which we will not be on your computer currently.
Erm from them to confirm pretty much what we’ve discussing today,

AM Hm.

FT Erm to give us more evidence in the light of what we have on today’s
particular print outs and everything so that’s, so on what we have
though we may need to come back and talk to you erm we may not,

AM Hm.

FT It just depends very much on what the outcome of what that is and what
decisions are made by people who erm are due to review the outcome of
the interview and erm and, and today’s

AM So then what does happen from this point on?

PT Well perhaps it may be easier to discuss that off tape - not that there’s
anything (inaudible)

AM No, I know, fine, I know...

FT But, but primarily there’re, there’re, there are two possibilities. The
facts without any embellishment, the facts which we have here are
reported back to the Post Office and then the Post Office will take a
view as to... what to do. There’s two possible lines. One is the

6:30 criminal. [t may be deemed that this case is

we have to show the evidence that we have and the report again will be

FT Erm and obviously we’ ll have to report to him this afternoon, let him
know what the outcome of this has been and he'll doubtless want to
come down and talk with you and

FT Gone on. Now,

IAM Can I just add something,

sw Yes, okay.

8:10 AM [It just (inaudible) on there and I hadn’t touch upon it or realised
before. Erm part of the problem with the timing for erm trying to get
the cash account to, to balance in acceptable level erm there were two
serious ongoing staff problems in here and there was...money not right,
going missing in that account for a Jeast a full erm range of that,

sw Hm, hm.

AM One, because of straight forward theft and the other because of massive
incompetence, massive. Erm both those cases were documented by
myself for internal disciplinary reasons and all the rest of it. Erm...but
(sighs) as a causal factor or as a reason to try and do something to
correct those accounts whatever, erm certainly it was a very difficult
period because there's nothing worse than money not being right,
obviously,

sw Am, hm.

AM And again those two things were both at the same time and it takes a
period of time to have these people no longer in the office erm you
know things corrected very. very quickly in the cash accounts after
almost the next week, next week, erm you know whatever...was being
done in the period of difficulties with them erm during that to, to make

that particular period, you know, I erm stress and difficult that,
