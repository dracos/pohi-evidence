                                            actually physically out on the system, put in.
                      SW                   And out pur them ...
                      AM                 , (Inaudible) we stru.1ed doing was, tnstead of putting anything in at all,
                                           we kept those with the foiis from the lunch time session on the dip. So
                                           in other words, ,ve took this decision some time ago because of the
                                           confusion there was over it, the totals. Um ..... the foils were only taken .
                                           out and con·ected that way, nothing was put in, so we decided that this
                                           v,,as the procedure we'll use from lhat point on. So in other \.Vords, if
                                           there's foils that physically aren't there at all in the system ...
                     S\V                   Mmmm.
                     AM                    ... are in, in correctly. Or ifit's a few pence, it's still taken out and it's
                                          not physically put back in till that run. Tt's kept for the ne.xt afternoon's
                                          run.
                    SW                    Yes, okay.
                    AM                    So, things are only taken out. So it's a temovals.
                    SW                    Right, so, if you came across a pension and there was a foil. r sar,
                                          fifty pounds and it was indicated on your print out that you should have
                                   it,
                                          but you don't have the foil.
                    ,-\J\11               Take it out of Lhe nm. (fJ find I have a foil for fifty pounds, and it's

                                                     had, how would your accounts balance.
                                  AM                 Well if it (inaudible) and

                                 SW                 I'd say I just want to get there if you balance this out and haven't checked the
                                                    pensions so say for instance if there had been a mistake and {inaudible) and !he

                                                    bundle there was only 9 foils at £75. how would you account balance.
                                AM                 All things being equal anything over or under should up if the cash has been equal
                                                   just to show up as an over

                                AM                 Yeah that is right. Again I believe this is standard practise, if the {inaudible) is
                                                   beyond a certain amount 50 or 60 we would keep it to one side and use it for
                                                   deficits or just keep it there you know whatever.
                               SW                  At the (inaudible) were mentioned and you'd agree !hen if there is 10 foils £75
                                                   showing on the add list and whenever you went to the bundle to check up there
                                                   was only 9 that the accounts should balance over.
                               AM                 if you tell the system you are paying out more and you actually paying out your
                                                  (inaudible) would be over because obviously that's with (inaudible) cash is right it
                                                  should show its over.

                                      Inaudible) £206.60 and we see that on this there are on the add listing you've got
                                     there it shows fi'-£266'.'66;-the-transaction log actually shows 18 and the J8 1h one
                                     was put in by yourself timed on this add listing is 1322 but the add listing time is an
                                     hour out because this is GMT and we are on British (inaudible) time at the moment
                                     so in fact it is 1422 (inaudible) 22 minutes past 2 yesterday afternoon you put a
                                     value of £206.60 into the system I will show you. Next to the block on the add list
                                     and if you look at the user name the user name shows AMC 601 is that your user
                                     name?
                           AM        That is right what, there was an (inaudible) foi the 206.60 entered in another group
                                     so that was
                           FT        So (inaudible} machine now there will a check on reversals we should find that he
                                    206.60 was reversed out?
                           AM       Pretty sure well should be reversed out then should be re-entered. Now I see that
                                    problem.
                           SW       So if you say you were the first to add up who (inaudible) machine now.
                           AM       No as I you asked me for an explanation my explanation will be must have been in
                                    another group or then must have been in another day not entered or entered in
                                    correctly this is the 3 these are the only 3 possibilities for taking something out, if
                                    they are not there, incorrectly entered or they will be in another group. The
                                    procedure is take them out and re-enter them those 3 as they are re-entered and
                                    then not checked as !he first printout yes I can say this has been the problem.
                          SW        So that is that one particular one there, group 7
                          AM        Bui if that was done and my (inaudible) was correct that actually (inaudible).

   1.26                 A.:M           Yeah.
                        SW             (inaudible). \Vhile the tapes were switched off can you confirm we did
                                       not discuss any details of the inquiry?
                       AM              Yes we didn't.
                       SW             So we go back to where we were, and we were at the balance. Never
                                      really looked at the entries.
                       AM             Emem.
                       SW             And repeated 3 I 1 and remember f asked you to explain the 3 areas that
                                      have bee discovered on the P23 I l you couldn't offer any explanation.
                       AM             Oh they said that the procedure that l follow and have followed, my last
                                      assumption was that that was correct and should account for anything
                                      taken out of system or put onto the system, that's all I can say. And f
                                      can see lhat if you don't, well it's to do with the pressure um of
                                      corr·ecting and entering things under the system that those things should
                                      be exactly the same. They should balance each other out.
                      SW              Emem.
                      AM             Now that is the way the procedure operates, it should operate.
                      SW             Ern en1.

                      A!'vl          All I can say is it clearly hasn't, rhis has not happened. And, there are
                                     values entered there which are from other foils. It's whether they were
                                     in other groups or they ·,vere corrections or they \.Vere held over for re-
                                     cntry. Um, J would say that that's the area er where they come from and
                                     clearly if they're not there they shouldn't be in.

                      SW             So as you mentioned before you thought you may have done the first.
                                     the first amount which was in the group 7. and it may have been a
                                     reversal.
                      A.M            ft may have been I don·1 know. I mean there were several. reversals.

                      FT             Are you disputing the figures? You know, the auditor didn't produced

                                     not been included in the cash declared - some have, some have been

                                      during the accounting week for your particular office, in this particular
                                      case, you've failed. And the Post Office accepted as being a true record.

                      FT              Now the discrepancies in this account are that the cash figure may have
                                      been adjusted prior to the final balance being produced,

                                     occurred 011 previous weeks as well. So two elements of the account,
                                     one the value of Pension AlJowances paid is inaccurate, and two, the
                                     value of cash 011 hand, which is shown in Table 5 of your cash account,
                                     has on occasions been inaccurate because it's either been increased or
                                     reduced to show an accurate balance, and in fact last night's account,

                    FT               We have there clear evidence of that that the amount of money that was
                                     recorded by a member of your staff was adjusted prior to it being
                                     declared in the cash account,

36:30               FT               And the amount that you declared was ... £600 and er £64,123.68 where
                                    as in reality .it was a large amotult of cash which was counted by a
                                    member of staff but it had been adjusted, it was adjusted by the value of
                                    about £660 and we've also demonstrated that rhe Pension Allowance
                                    foils claimed in your account whicJ1 is shown as £215,034.60 was also
                                    in, inclu, er inflated by a value of £381.60. So in one account we have

                             Al'vf                       Yeah, they, they're not accurate.
                             SW                         And that you were aware whenever the auditors arrived today that the

                            SW                          And the reason for this would be because of the three discrepancies that
                                                        we have highlighted in the interview today and where you had entered

                            SW                          Would that be right?
                            AM                          Yes.
                            SW                         And that over a period of time, mainly maybe from the start of the year,
                                                       January, erm this had been what you have been doing? On a weekly
                                                       basis? Or could have done?
                           AM                          This would have been out,
                           SW                          Or could have done?
                           AM                          A regular pattern.
                           SW                          A regular pattern. And you had been using the Pension Allowance enn
