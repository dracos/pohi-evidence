@ Annex A: PossiBLe AGENDA PoINTs For DiscussiON

FINANCIAL = POL beat operating profit targets for the year ending March 2015 (outturn of £100m vs. budget of £99m)
PERFORMANCE although revenue fell short of budget by £55m. Results were therefore mainly driven by cost control.

= Paula may reflect on this, particularly after a very difficult start to the 2014/15 financial year. It shows that
the business is willing to take hard decisions and focused action to respond to underperformance.

= POL’s annual report is scheduled to be published at the end of this month. Furthermore the new financial
year has also started well, and after one month POL is ahead of budget in revenue and operating profit.

LonG TERM = POL is working on a refresh of its strategic plan and expects to present this to HMG mid-year. Although it

STRATEGY is likely to move away from existing targets POL is confident of operating in line with available funding.

6) = Paula might want to talk about the progress POL have made in their plan to date, including highlighting
the main challenges faced and those ahead.

NETWORK = Paula may want to update you on NT; progress has been strong and to date more than 75 per cent. of

TRANSFORMATION eligible branches have been modernised or are contractually committed to be transformed.

(«NT”)

= Paula may also want to talk about actions being taken to complete NT by the planned end-date in 2018.
This includes communicating with a number of branches in coming weeks of changes to contract terms.

NATIONAL = Paula may update you on progress to agree a new funding model for the NFSP, who are the

FEDERATION OF representative body for subpostmasters and who boast a membership of >6,000 operators of branches.
UBPOSTMASTERS : : ae Hop

ads = This new model looks to move the NFSP away from being a subscription based organisation, negotiating

on behalf of subpostmasters, to one where its interests are better aligned with POL.

@ Annex A: PossiBLe AGENDA POINTS For DISCUSSION (CONT’D)

Premium BonDs/ = NS&lI has confirmed that it is not renewing its contract with POL for the sale of Premium Bonds. This is an
NS&l iconic product which POL has sold for >60 years, and it will be withdrawn from branches from August.

= From a shareholder perspective this is disappointing. The contract delivers £8.5m revenue per year and
its loss will very likely trigger hostile reactions — focused on HMG — from stakeholders and the press.

= You have been sighted on advice provided to Baroness Neville-Rolfe on 9 June; following this a call is
being scheduled between the Minister and Harriett Baldwin at HMT to discuss the situation.

= Paula may also use this issue to prompt a discussion about POL’s business with Government more
generally (e.g. traditional Government services revenues are declining with the move to digital).

BANKING = POL are working with the BBA and high street banks to develop a standardised service to all personal

SERVICES and SME current account customers in the UK (e.g. withdrawals and deposits). This is important as with
banks continuing to shut branches POL is increasingly the only provider of these services in many
communities.

= Discussions have slowed in the past few weeks although negotiations are continuing. Paula might want to
seek your views on this topic, and on access to finance (and POL’s role here) more generally.

= You have been sighted on advice provided to Anna Soubry on 10 June; this seeks guidance on what role
BIS should play in this area after some negative press coverage following the General Election.
HORIZON IT = There continues to be no evidence of systemic fault with POL’s IT system and the mediation scheme is
@rm ongoing. This remains independent of Government, and POL are supportive of this approach.

= Paula may want to discuss POL’s handling of the Horizon mediation scheme and the forthcoming BBC.
Panorama programme on this, which is tentatively scheduled for Monday 29 June.

@) OVERVIEW OF POL

UKGI00004507
UKG100004507

POL operates a network of c.11,700 Post Office branches, and delivers a
wide range of services across mails and retail, financial services,
Government services and telephony markets. This network is larger than all
the branches operated by the high street banks combined.

The business owns and operates about 300 of its branches, known as
Crowns, which account for c.15 per cent. revenue. The remaining 11,400
branches are managed by independent entrepreneurs known as
subpostmasters, who operate standalone post office branches or branches
that are co-located in other retail premises (e.g. convenience or grocery).

POL has c.6,700 direct employees who mainly work in its c.300 owned
branches, its cash management operation and its network support function.
It is however also responsible for the employment of more than 50,000
additional people via its subpostmasters and their employees.

In 2014/15 POL generated revenue of £870m (£1,030m including Network
Subsidy) and an operating profit of £100m. POL’s most significant cost is
payments made to subpostmasters — in 2014/15 £435m was paid out to
c.11,400 subpostmasters, averaging c.£38,000 per branch. After
subpostmaster payments, POL’s largest expenditures are: Staff Costs
(c.£234m); IT (c.£104m); and Property (c.£53m).

OVERVIEW OF POL FUNDING

Government provides funding to POL in order to maintain a network beyond its optimal commercial size and footprint, and to
make this network more efficient. Currently the requirement is for POL to operate a network of more than 11,500 branches
which meets 5 clearly defined access criteria (e.g. 99% of the UK population must live within 3 miles of their nearest post office).
There is a legally-binding funding agreement between Government and POL linked to this.

Since 2010 Government has committed £1,975m to POL. This has been focused on two areas:

NeETworK Sussipy (£1,030m): Payment to maintain a network of post offices in line with Government's requirements. This is
recognised by POL as revenue in its accounts.

INVESTMENT FUNDING (£945m): Funding for POL to invest in its network, to make it more efficient and less reliant on taxpayer
funding. This is recognised by POL as a direct cashflow in its accounts.

As a result of its network modernisation strategy, cost efficiencies and revenue growth POL anticipates being able to reduce its
recurring funding requirement to around £50m from 2019/20. This would support >3,000 branches which serve a “social” purpose
but which would not be financially viable in their own right.

LONG TERM STRATEGY

POL’s strategy was developed in 2013 and covers the period to March 2020. It represented a continuation of POL’s previous
plan and forms part of the basis on which POL secured Government's recent £640m funding commitment. It is focused on
delivering a financially sustainable POL, less reliant on subsidy, and is centred on three core pillars.

PILLAR I: NETWORK TRANSFORMATION

= Aim: Complete the network investment strategy, modernising branches to improve customers’ experience and making them
less reliant on taxpayer support.

= Status: Generally has progressed in line with plans.

PILLAR Il: REVENUE GROWTH

= Aim: Increased sales in existing areas and launch of new products and services, focusing on particular strengths in mails and
retail, financial services and Government services.

= Status: Slower than expected progress, with low demand growth, fewer new contracts than expected (particularly in
Government Services) and intense competition.

PILLAR Ill: TRANSFORMATION AND EFFICIENCY

= Aim: Reduce costs through a significant transformation of POL’s IT infrastructure and a restructuring of the corporate
overhead.

= Status: Again, progress has been slower than expected, particularly due to frequently volatile or hostile relations with key
stakeholders including subpostmaster and employee representatives.

POL has been working on a refresh of its strategic plan for the past few months, which is expected to be presented to
Government in mid-2015. We expect that the main objectives and pillars of this will remain the same, but that some details might
change and financial targets will be reduced. However, POL is confident that it will be able to deliver the refreshed strategy in

Brspathtpegyalaole funding.

HORIZON SYSTEM AND MEDIATION SCHEME

Following complaints from a small number of (mostly former) subpostmasters about the Horizon IT system, in 2012 the Post
Office commissioned an independent firm, Second Sight, to examine the system for systemic flaws that could cause accounting
discrepancies.

Second Sight’s interim report, published in July 2013, and final report, published in April 2015, both make clear that there is
no evidence of system-wide problems with Horizon.

The interim report raised some questions about the training and support offered to some subpostmasters, and Post Office
implemented a series of measures to improve its processes and also created a mediation scheme to consider individual
subpostmasters’ cases.

A working group was created to set up the mediation scheme, consisting of POL, Second Sight and the Justice for
Subpostmasters Alliance (“JFSA”) and with an independent Chair: Sir Anthony Hooper, a former Court of Appeal judge.

Each case in the scheme was subject to a re-investigation by POL and independent review by Second Sight, after which the
case could proceed to mediation overseen by an independent mediator. Mediation is voluntary and requires the consent of
both parties. It is not a compensation scheme, although an outcome of mediation could be for POL to offer some
compensation.

Individuals who had criminal convictions (usually for theft or false accounting) were eligible for the scheme, but on the basis
that mediation cannot overturn a Court judgment. POL consider whether to mediate these applications on a case-by-case
basis. Any individual who feels their conviction is unsafe can pursue legal avenues, regardless of whether they enter into
mediation.

POL hopes to complete mediation on all remaining cases by the end of 2015. However JFSA are attempting to delay any
future mediations and are campaigning for a new independent scheme.

POL’s Horizon System and Mediation Scheme has received some coverage in printed and broadcast media, mostly driven by
the JFSA. In particular it has featured on the BBC’s “The One Show’ and regional airings of “Inside Out”.

@ASprisedeoidranorama on this topic is due to be broadcast on 29 June. This will mainly be a matter for POL but officials have

been workingslosely with POL, Ministers and SPADs to make sure any risks related to this are managed appropriately.. 1"
