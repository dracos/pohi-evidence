Subject: Actions from the meetings with Jonathan Swift QC and Christopher Knight
All,

Thank you for the ‘Rolls Royce’ contributions you each made at the meetings held on Monday and Tuesday. It was also
nice to finally be able to meet you in person Kath, Shirley and Kendra. There are a number of actions that I think fell
out from the meetings, which I think I have captured below. Could you please let me know if I have missed anything?
Angela — Could you please provide me with:
- The lessons learnt document you provided a hard copy of to Christopher;
- The number of Audits that have taken place over the last three years, by type (Random, due to
risk profiling etc); and
- The presentation Pete Newsome supplied to you last Friday on the recent ‘force log out’ issue
(this came out of the meeting with Fujitsu).
Kath & Shirley — Could you please provide me with:
- The “case catalogue” which includes the number of cases that involved false accounting
Kendra —I do not have any outstanding actions against your name — but do let me know if I have missed something

Thanks again all

Mark
