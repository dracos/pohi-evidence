BASILDON CROWN COURT - PLEA & CASE MANAGEMENT HEARING — 18 AUGUST 2006

CASE POLTD/0506/0619

The Brief for the Prosecution has been sent to Mr Stephen John of Counsel. A copy of the

Indictment is enclosed herewith for your information.

A copy of Counsel's Advice on Evidence is also attached. I would be grateful if you could

deal with the matters raised at Paragraphs 3 and 4.

If a List of Dates to avoid has not already been provided this should be done as quickly as

possible.

I remind you of the continuing requirement of disclosure of any material which might
undermine the Prosecution case and would ask that copies of all material not yet disclosed
be forwarded to this Office immediately, on Forms CSOO6C, D and E. Further Forms
CSO06C, D and E will be required when the defence case is served as we will then need to

disclose any material which will assist the defence case.

The Officer in the case must attend all Crown Court Hearings.

Miss J S Andrews
Criminal Law Division
