Details of visit The above office has a loss from week 19 of £592.21. OIC states this is

something to do with an upgrade of Horizon and a problem with the declaration of
the cash. There is no errors so | am unable to put in suspense. OIC is unable to
make good as the Pm on holiday until 12/09/05.

Please contact office and reply within 7 days. Ann Wilde

| attended the office today to find that the loss has now cleared for no apparaent
reason. The office balanced £1330 short last week but this was due to a £1250
entry with the ATM meaning that this should straighten itself out on balancing
today. This will make a shortage of £80 which the spmr will make good.
