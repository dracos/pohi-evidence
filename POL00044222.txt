Branch                      Fazakerley               Postcode    L9 9DB         Fad Code       I 214420
Details of visit            The above office has a loss from week 19 of £592.21. OIC states this is
                            something to do with an upgrade of Horizon and a problem with the declaration of
                            the cash. There is no errors so I am unable to put in suspense. OIC is unable to
                            make good as the Pm on holiday until 12/09/05.
                            Please contact office and reply within 7 days. Ann Wilde

                            I attended the office today to find that the loss has now cleared for no apparaent
                            reason. The office balanced £1330 short last week but this was due to a £1250
                            entry with the ATM meaning that this should straighten itself out on balancing
                            today. This will make a shortage of £80 which the spmr will make good.
