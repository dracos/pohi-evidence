Message from Simon Recaldin
JESU CSUSB EE BSB GEE

Yesterday marked a significant milestone in RU’s journey - providing compensation to

POL00458391
POL00458391
POL00458391

POL00458391

Postmasters and Postmistresses across all our remediation programmes.
Why?

Yesterday we issued the last HSS offer from the original cohort. This is a significant milestone
and one that must be recognised.

So no balloons, no fanfare, no music, no glitter and certainly no bunting — it sort of doesn’t work
that way in Remediation does it?

What it does call for however is — today - a moment of reflection on a job so professionally
delivered over a sustained period under extraordinary circumstances. Well done.

It also calls for me to recognise all of you for a job superbly executed — thank you. Honestly, I
have a range of emotions about this, but gratitude to all of you is by far the most overwhelming
one for making this happen — including of course our colleagues in HSF and government who are
on copy.

So:

e Well done and thank you — done by the end of November 2023

e We're not finished of course until we resolve those in dispute which we are on

e Let’s plough on through the HSS Late Applications — we will announce a closing date soon

e Let’s step into OC and get those £600k payments out by Christmas and move into the
other Pecuniary cases now we have everything agreed 2024 is going to be a big year in OC

e Deliver, deliver, deliver the GLO disclosure

e Let’s boss the SRR and get back on plan — this will be in a good shape soon

e Let’s deliver a quality PPR across 2024

e Let’s support the Inquiry tirelessly as it goes through Phases 5, 6 and 7

Lots to do.

Above all - hold your heads up high for a job well done — be proud.
Above that..... thank you.

Regards

Simon
