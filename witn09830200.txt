| also exhibit two reviews of the mediation service element of the Complaints
and Mediation Scheme (the “Scheme”) produced by John Munton, Director of
Dispute Resolution Services at the Centre for Alternative Dispute Resolution
(“CEDR”) [POL00158207] [POL00078426]. The reviews — dated 24 February
2015 and 31 July 2015 — were a requirement of CEDR’s contract to provide the
mediation element of the Scheme, as it was felt important by a number of
stakeholders, including POL, that there should be ongoing monitoring of the
Scheme by CEDR because of their independence. The reviews were prepared
by Mr Munton to assist the parties to the Scheme. He made a number of

observations in his reviews:

WITNO09830200
WITN09830200

a) “On a number of the mediations that have taken place so far the
subpostmaster has not fully comprehended the nature of mediation as a
process and they have also been influenced by the wider campaign
asserting the failings of the Horizon system. They have, therefore,
sometimes attended with the expectation that they are going into a
compensation process rather than a facilitated dialogue with the Post Office
in which claims made by either party do require some prior notification,

explanation and evidential validation.” (page 3, 31 July 2015 Review)

b) “POL at considerable effort and expense attended a full day's mediation
and made a reasonable settlement offer in the circumstances. [The
subpostmasters] requests were not realistic and [the applicant] continued to
believe ....was not guilty of false accounting, despite the weight of evidence’
Mediator report extract (page 3, 31 July 2015 Review)

“The subpostmasters] expectations set by the mediation scheme steering
committee were that the mediation scheme was a compensation scheme”

Mediator report extract (page 4, 31 July 2015 Review)

d) “Mr ... had highly unrealistic expectations of compensation ... this was

largely created by his adviser” Mediator report extract (page 4, 31 July 2015

Review)

WITN09830200

e) “Having spoken to all of the mediators used so far there is a consensus that
perhaps some of the cases referred to mediation under the Scheme would
not have made it to that stage within a litigation process given the
uncertainty over the issues and lack of evidence available.” (page 4, 31 July

2015 Review)

f) “Claim appeared to relate to alleged losses but on the day the termination
of an agency agreement was apparently the key issue and this did not

appear to have been articulated before.” Mediator report extract (page 4,

31 July 2015 Review)

g) “The basis and amount of ... claim was not clear. .. had not adduced any

evidence in support of... claim.” Mediator report extract (page 4, 31 July

2015 Review)

h) “Mediator reports in this Scheme suggest that subpostmaster expectations
of entering a compensation dialogue are frequently at variance with the Post
Office representatives’ approach of seeking credible evidence to justify
claims before seeing a need to make negotiation offers.” (page 4, 31 July

2015 Review)

i) “In terms of the mediations themselves it is clear from the reports that the

Post Office has a willingness to explore the options, express empathy and

Page 4 of 9

WITN09830200

have constructive dialogue with the subpostmasters.” (page 6, 31 July 2015

Review)

j) “Mediation... has led to practical agreed outcomes in almost half of the

cases so far conducted.” (page 7, 31 July 2015 Review)
