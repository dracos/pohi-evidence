                        POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




             SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF PATRICK BOURKE



I, Patrick Bourke, will say as follows:


1      This second witness statement (the "Second Witness Statement") is made in

       order to amend my first witness statement, dated 11 April 2024, (the "First

       Witness Statement").


2      At paragraph 134 of my First Witness Statement there is a transcription error:

       the year of the email I describe [POL00149296] is 2014 and not 2018.


3      At paragraph 144 of my First Witness Statement, I refer to an email dated 20

       November 2014 10:47, from Mark Underwood to Tom Wechsler, with me in

       copy, attaching a paper produced by Andrew Parsons and a bulleted lists of

       points for public rebuttals, exhibiting a version of Andrew Parsons' paper and

       its covering email [POL00212048] and [POL00212049] respectively. I now

       exhibit to this Second Witness Statement the version of Andrew Parsons' paper

       [POL00149579] and the bulleted list [POL00149580] which were attached to

                                          Page 1 of 9
                                                                                    WI TN09830200
                                                                                  WI TN09830200




    the email of 20 November 2014 10:47. At paragraph 144, I also refer to and

    quote from an email from Andrew Parsons of 25 November 2014 at 14:37,

    which I now exhibit to this Second Witness Statement [POL00149655].


4   At paragraph 157 of my First Witness Statement I refer to an email dated 10

    November 2014 16:44 from Andrew Parsons which states: "I've also had some

    more information from Deloitte that I have included in the note" [POL00149483]

    but I had not located nor could I recall the note. I have since realised that the

    note referred to in [POL00149483] is a version of the note I refer to at paragraph

    144, and which I exhibit to paragraph 3 of this Second Witness Statement

    [POL00149579].


5   References to Second Sight's Part Two Report at paragraphs 52, 54, 57 of my

    First Witness Statement all refer to the draft Part Two Report.


6   I also exhibit two reviews of the mediation service element of the Complaints

    and Mediation Scheme (the "Scheme") produced by John Munton, Director of

    Dispute Resolution Services at the Centre for Alternative Dispute Resolution

    ("CEDR") [POL00158207] [POL00078426]. The reviews — dated 24 February

    2015 and 31 July 2015 — were a requirement of CEDR's contract to provide the

    mediation element of the Scheme, as it was felt important by a number of

    stakeholders, including POL, that there should be ongoing monitoring of the

    Scheme by CEDR because of their independence. The reviews were prepared

    by Mr Munton to assist the parties to the Scheme. He made a number of

    observations in his reviews:

                                                                              WI TN09830200




a) "On a number of the mediations that have taken place so far the

   subpostmaster has not fully comprehended the nature of mediation as a

   process and they have also been influenced by the wider campaign

   asserting the failings of the Horizon system. They have, therefore,

   sometimes attended with the expectation that they are going into a

   compensation process rather than a facilitated dialogue with the Post Office

   in which claims made by either party do require some prior notification,

   explanation and evidential validation." (page 3, 31 July 2015 Review)



b) "'POL at considerable effort and expense attended a full day's mediation

   and made a reasonable settlement offer in the circumstances. [The

   subpostmasters] requests were not realistic and [the applicant] continued to

   believe ....was not guilty of false accounting, despite the weight of evidence'

   Mediator report extract (page 3, 31 July 2015 Review)



c) ' [The subpostmasters] expectations set by the mediation scheme steering

   committee were that the mediation scheme was a compensation scheme"

   Mediator report extract (page 4, 31 July 2015 Review)



d) "Mr ... had highly unrealistic expectations of compensation ... this was

   largely created by his adviser" Mediator report extract (page 4, 31 July 2015

   Review)




                               Page 3 of 9

                                                                            WI TN09830200




e) "Having spoken to all of the mediators used so far there is a consensus that

   perhaps some of the cases referred to mediation under the Scheme would

   not have made it to that stage within a litigation process given the

   uncertainty over the issues and lack of evidence available." (page 4, 31 July

   2015 Review)



f) ''Claim appeared to relate to alleged losses but on the day the termination

   of an agency agreement was apparently the key issue and this did not

   appear to have been articulated before." Mediator report extract (page 4,

   31 July 2015 Review)



g) "'The basis and amount of ... claim was not clear. .. had not adduced any

   evidence in support of... claim." Mediator report extract (page 4, 31 July

   2015 Review)



h) "Mediator reports in this Scheme suggest that subpostmaster expectations

   of entering a compensation dialogue are frequently at variance with the Post

   Office representatives' approach of seeking credible evidence to justify

   claims before seeing a need to make negotiation offers." (page 4, 31 July

   2015 Review)



i) "In terms of the mediations themselves it is clear from the reports that the

   Post Office has a willingness to explore the options, express empathy and

         have constructive dialogue with the subpostmasters." (page 6, 31 July 2015

         Review)



      j) "Mediation... has led to practical agreed outcomes in almost half of the

         cases so far conducted." (page 7, 31 July 2015 Review)
