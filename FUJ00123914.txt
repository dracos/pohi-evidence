1 Purpose

This document provides a report about investigations into the Integrity of the Horizon System provided by
Fujitsu to Post Office Ltd.

It has been produced at the request of Jarnail Singh of Post Office Ltd

There are two separate reports that have been previously produced covering the integrity of Horizon
[ARC/GEN/REP/0004] and Horizon Online [Horizon Online Data Integrity] respectively.

The purpose of this report is to provide some further background information and relate this to current
cases.

1.1. Document Structure

Section 2 of the document describes the Horizon system at a high level, giving a time-line for its
development, the Business scope and Architecture diagrams for both the original Horizon System and
the current Horizon Online system.

Section 3 then summarises my views on the overall integrity of the Horizon system and my involvement
in various related cases that Post Office Ltd have asked me to consider.

2.1

The Horizon System

Timeline

Fujitsu were originally awarded a contract in 1996 to provide a Horizon System to Post Office Ltd. The
following provides some key dates and functional changes:

Horizon Pilot 1996

Horizon Rollout 1999 — 2002
Network Banking 2003

EMV 2004

Cash Account removed 2005
Data Centre Migration 2009
HNG-X Rollout 2010

Horizon Online (or HNG-X) was a major re-implementation of Horizon. It was a complete re-
implementation of the business functionality at the counter and utilised a central Database to hold details
of all transactions rather than the MessageStore used by the original Horizon system.

All Post Office Branches migrated from the original Horizon to Horizon Online between January and
September 2010. Historical transactions were made visible in the new system as part of the migration
process.

2.2

Business Scope

The Business scope of Horizon is:

Point Of Sale Application
Transaction Recording
o  Allsuch transactions are Audited
Posting Summary Transactions to POL SAP (Post Office Ltd's back end accounting system)

Posting Detailed Transactions to Credence (Post Office Ltd’s back end Management Information
system)

Posting Remuneration Data to HR-SAP (Royal Mail Group's back end Payroll system)

Delivering Client Data to Post Office Ltd's Clients (ie 3% parties that Post Office Ltd acts as an
agent for such as Local Authorities and Utility companies etc)

3 Horizon Integrity

This is described in the separate integrity documents [ARC/GEN/REP/0004] and [Horizon Online Data
Integrity].

I have been involved personally in a number of challenges to the integrity of the original Horizon system
and produced Witness Statements for a number of cases where the Integrity has been challenged. I am
not aware of any cases where the Integrity of Horizon Online has yet been challenged in court.

I have been passed two documents by Mr Jarnail Singh of Post Office:

e [HR Spread]: This is a Spreadsheet prepared by Helen Rose of Post Office Ltd summarising 25
cases where the Integrity of Horizon or Horizon Online may have been called into question

e [HR Doc]: This is a report also produced by Helen Rose providing further information of 5 of the
cases.

I have looked through the Spreadsheet and recognise the following cases as ones in which I have had
some involvement:

1. Porters Avenue

I attended a case review for this in May 2010 and also provided some comments on the Defence
Expert Witness's Report (produced by Mr Jeffrey E. C. Davidson), but did not appear in court at
the trial

2. West Byfleet

I provided a Witness Statement for this case [Misra Witness Statement] which was a commentary
on the Defence Expert Witness’s Report (produced by Professor Charles McLachlan). I was also.
called as an Expert Witness at the trial and carried out significant analysis of the data produced
as evidence.

In this case the Defendant was found Guilty of both False Accounting and Theft.
3. Rinkfield

I provided a Witness Statement for this case which was a commentary on the Defence Expert
Witness’s Report (produced by Professor Charles McLachlan). This report by Professor
McLachlan was very similar to that which he had produced for West Byfleet case and repeated
much of the same arguments which had been presented in the West Byfleet case. Again I
carried out significant analysis of the data produced as evidence.

I went to court to appear as an Expert Witness, but at the last minute a deal was agreed and the
case did not go to trial.

4. Bishops Hull

I was asked for my views on the Defence Expert Witness’s Report (produced by Mr Mark
Jenner). Having read the report I my view was that in general I agreed with the report. It did not
question the integrity of Horizon, but more the way in which the branch had been managed and
processes not been followed.

The time span of the data associated with this case covered both the Horizon and Horizon Online
Operations. However I did not do any detailed analysis of the data.

I don't believe that this case has yet come to trial.
As I don't recall having any involvement with the other 21 cases I can make no further comment on those.

The main challenges in both the West Byfleet and Rinkfield cases were presented as “Hypothetical
issues” and my Witness Statement in the West Byfleet case [Misra Witness Statement] goes through

each of these hypotheses and shows that there is no specific evidence for any of them in the data
presented.

In summary I would conclude by saying that I fully believe that Horizon will accurately record all data that
is submitted to it and correctly account for it. However it cannot compensate for any data that is
incorrectly input into it as a result of human error, lack of training or fraud (and nor can any other system).
