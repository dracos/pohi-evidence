Version Changes
0.2 As a result of meetings with POCL a set of changes has been

identified and approved in CP2415. The changes will affect layout
and content of forms and reports but have no effect on the design
fundamentals. Consequently the only sections affected are 5.1
through 5.4. The changes requested in the CP are listed below.

e The service code field needs removing, whereas incident type
remains the same / replaces the aforementioned field. The data
for this field will be one of the following options: ‘APS,
EPOSS, OBCS’.

e ‘Exception Total’ needs changing to ‘Exception Value’.

e Several new fields need adding under the ‘BIMS heading / area’
are ‘Transaction Date’, ‘FAD’ and ‘CAP’ (these are non-
compulsory fields).

e Under the ‘Other References’ heading, ‘TIP reference’ needs
changing to ‘TIP/TP/OSG Reference’.

e Under the ‘System Incident References’ remove the ‘D’ from
HSHD so that it is shown as ‘HSH’.

e Liability heading to be re-titled ‘Transaction Liability’.
e ‘Transaction credit’ field is to be removed.
¢ Under settlement details:

The heading ‘Investigation Cost Settlement’ is replaced with
“Manual Error Report Charge’.

Design Version: 2.1

Company In Confidence Date: 21/11/01

e The fields below MER Charge require amending to the
following:

Number of chargeable MER
MER Settlement Amount (replaces IC Settlement Amount)
MER Invoice Number (replaces IC Invoice Number)
MER Invoice Date (replaces IC Inv Date)
e ‘Transaction’ heading requires changing to ‘Transaction Detail’.

e Then a subheading adjacent to ‘Transaction Detail’ is required
stating ‘Manual Error Report’, with a Yes / No facility.

e All hard coded ‘Predefined Transaction’ fields to be removed
and replaced by 20 ‘Definable Transaction’ fields.

e For each ‘Definable Transaction’ that is listed, the user needs to
be able to select the type which will be:

e Transaction error

e Cash account error (this could be done as a drop down where
one of the 2 is selected).

1.0

Minor corrections for review comments.

A new field, Txn Cost, has been added to the Transactions table and
therefore to the transactions subform. The sum of the transaction
costs for an incident is now used to populate the MER Set Amt field
in the Incidents table. The TXN Error Type field now becomes
redundant. A Charging Summary report has been introduced for
MSU use.

2.0

None, approved version.

21

Correction of discrepancies between the HLD and the live system
found during the handover process between IPDU and SSC. The
document has also been reformatted with the latest Pathway
Document Template to avoid the problem of the old ICL fonts not
being present on individual PCs.

0.6 Changes Expected

ICL Pathway Ltd —_ Business Incident Management Service High Level __ Ref: TD/DES/129

Design Version: 2.1

Company In Confidence Date: 21/11/01

1.0 Introduction

The purpose of this document is to specify the High Level Design for the Business Incident
Management Service to be implemented for Customer Services Management Support Unit
(MSU). The requirements for the service are stated in the document ‘Requirements for a
Business Incident Management Service’, [1]. The scope of these requirements is limited by
CP2352. The design has been prototyped with the help of Angela Shaw of Customer
Services MSU.

2.0 Scope

CP2352 states that it introduces the first phase of a 2-stage implementation of BIMS. Stage
one of the implementation covers the functionality to support logging, tracking and hard-copy
reporting of incidents. The solution is to be a direct replacement for the existing RED
database. The second phase was to be covered by a further CP, requesting the
implementation of a solution for delivery of reports to POCL. This second stage is not now
expected to be implemented.

CP2628 introduces changes to the reporting of transaction costs, following a change of
procedure agreed with POCL.

3.0 Design Principles

A main priority for the TDA solution to the MSU’s requirements was to achieve minimum
cost, whilst still providing an adequate service. To this end it was decided that the
architecture for the service should be the same as for the existing RED database, i.e. a
Microsoft Access database residing on a Customer Services server, subject to the existing
access restrictions (see later section).

A prototype has been developed as part of the design process. This was further developed to
become a first version of the system.

The original requirement to provide a report delivery facility is not now expected to be
implemented. Should the requirement for electronic delivery of incident reports to POCL be
revisited at a later date the solution should form part of a wider solution to cover all of
MSU’s reports for POCL. This is outside the scope of the current version of the document.

4.0 Requirements

The following requirements have been extracted from the Requirements Catalogue in the
requirements scope document [1]. Where a requirement has been limited by CP2532 or held
back for later implementation a comment has been attached in italics.

4.1 Functional Requirements

4.1.1 Incident Logging

a) A facility is required to enable the receipt, progress and resolution of incidents to be
logged. Each incident must be uniquely identifiable for subsequent enquiry.

b) It must be possible to attach evidence such as a scanned document to an incident.

Design rcs
Version: 2.1

Company In Confidence Date: 21/11/01
c) It must be possible to cross-reference incidents of a similar nature.
4.1.2 Incident Enquiry
a) It must be possible to view the entire history of an incident, including individual

actions and final conclusion.

b) It must be possible to group incidents into categories for subsequent analysis.
c) It must be possible to monitor progress against a Service Level Agreement. A

reminder must be issued on loading the system for any incidents that must be cleared
by close of business that day.

d) The new service must cut-over at the start of a calendar month. Information regarding
APS and EPOSS incidents captured in the existing RED database from the start of
NR2 does not have to be accessible via the new service but must be available for
update of outstanding incidents and for viewing of old incidents.

4.1.3 Progress Reporting

a) The receipt, progress and resolution of an incident must be reported to POCL.
Incident updates must be delivered on a daily basis, normally at the end of the
working day, to HAPS(Farnborough), TIP(Chesterfield) and BSM(Sheffield).

b) Provision must be made to replace the current practice of faxing/posting updates.
With the volumes expected it will no longer be practical to deliver reports in this way.
The MSU’s preferred method is for POCL to have read-only access to the database
(or a copy) as no information is held that should not be seen by POCL. Alternatively,
a solution where updates are posted to an intranet website to which POCL have access
would be acceptable provided the extra work involved in transferring the information
is minimal.

This requirement is to be satisfied in the second stage of the implementation. In the interim, a hard-
copy facility must be available to allow the current practice of posting updates to continue.

c) It must be possible to carry out ad hoc enquiries by incident in order to answer
immediate queries, e.g. telephone queries, data-protection queries.
4.1.4 Reference & Static Data

a) Where an incident is related to an outlet it must be possible to record the FAD Code
and use it for subsequent analysis.

b) It must be possible for MSU staff to maintain the static data tables, to introduce new
analysis codes, etc., as necessary.

c) A charge may be applied to incidents to cover investigation costs. An investigation
cost base value needs to be held so that a new rate can be applied to an individual
incident, where applicable, without the need for reprogramming.

4.1.5 Internal Reporting

a) A report of Liability settlements is required, showing invoice details where final
liability has been assigned.

b) An SLA Status report is required to enable performance against SLAs to be tracked.

Design Version: 2.1
Company In Confidence Date: 21/11/01
c) An ad hoc reporting facility is required to enable MSU staff to generate their own

additional reports and enquiries. Access to the database from both Microsoft Access
and Business Objects is required.

4.2 Non-functional Requirements

Note: the Audit and Security requirements included here were originally drawn up for RED.
It has been confirmed that these requirements still stand and should also apply to BIMS.

4.2.1 Audit

It has been decided that the BIMS database should be included in the standard audit
procedures. This needs to be taken into account in both the choice of platform and the system
design.

BIMS-IAR2_ All records of exceptions handled, investigated and resolved by MSU and
recorded on BIMS must be retained for a period not less than 18 months.

BIMS-IAR6 Each change or input to BIMS must be associated with the person carrying out
the change or input.

4.2.2 Security

BIMS-IAR4_ The BIMS facility must be physically secure and access to it limited to those
personnel specifically authorised.

BIMS-IARS Logical access to the BIMS facility must be password controlled. Effective
password management must be practised.

4.2.3 Access

a) The service must allow for multi-user access. This is necessary to cater for possible
peaks in incident occurrence and for increased staffing levels in the event of
significant increase in incident volumes during Roll Out.

b) The client application should reside on the PCs of the individual users.
The intention of this requirement was for provision of access to the service from the
user’s PCs rather than from a standalone box. The requirement has been satisfied by
placing the client application on the MSU server in a folder restricted to the
authorised users. The application is then accessed by the users from their own PCs.
This solution avoids having to load enhancements on several boxes and allow better
sharing of queries, etc.

c) Access to the database must be provided for use with Business Objects for MIS
reporting purposes.
4.2.4 Performance

a) The service must be capable of supporting 10 users processing an estimated 70
incidents per day at full Roll Out. Each incident may be updated an average of three
times after creation, including final closure.

b) A clear-down process must be provided to remove incidents which have been closed
for 18 months.

Design Version: 2.1

Company In Confidence Date: 21/11/01

4.2.5 Resilience

a) The MSU needs a properly supported service. The existing system is currently
supported by staff with limited knowledge of Access.

b) The service should provide for daily backups to ensure manageable levels of re-input
effort in the event of system failure. For loss of the database alone, a restore to the last
dump will be sufficient based on current volumes. They may need to put some kind
of manual procedure in place to aid re-input should it be necessary.

4.2.6 Service Levels

a) The MSU feel they could cope for 2 days in the event of loss of the system. A longer
period of downtime could cause a backlog that couldn’t be caught up. The impact of
a loss of service would vary according to the type of incidents being reported. A
series of incidents requiring lots of updates to HAPS would be a problem. A manual
procedure has been defined for use in overload situations but this does have the
disadvantage that detailed information for subsequent analysis will be lost.

4.3 Requirements for CP2628

The functional requirements are changed as a result of CP2628.

e Transactions (MERs) for an incident may now be mixed, in that cash account errors and
transaction errors may be logged for the same incident. The transaction error type is
therefore redundant and can be removed from the screen.

e There is now no requirement to add an indicator to the transaction record to show the
transaction type.

e An additional field is required against each individual transaction record, in order to hold
the cost which will be entered manually. The value will not be defaulted to the next
transaction.

e The transaction (MER) amount for an incident is to be calculated as the sum of the
transaction costs for the incident.

e An additional monthly summary report for export to POCL is required, which lists all
MERs for agreement.

5.0 System Components

5.1 Application Components
5.1.1 Static Data Maintenance

5.1.11 BIMS Calendar Maintenance

A function will be provided to allow the BIMS Calendar table to be updated. Dates may be
added and their associated details changed as required. If the details are changed after any
reports have been run for the month in question it is the responsibility of the user to ensure
that a replacement report is produced if required.

ICL Pathway Ltd —_ Business Incident Management Service High Level __ Ref: TD/DES/129

Design Version: 2.1

Company In Confidence Date: 21/11/01

Dates may be added automatically by clicking on the Add Dates button. A pop-up screen is
displayed to enable an end date to be selected. Rows are then added to the table for each
calendar date between the current highest date and the date selected. The columns are set to
the default values defined below but may be amended as necessary. In particular the Day
Status must be updated for holidays (*H’).

Day Status “S’ (for Mon-Fri) or ‘W’ (for Sat & Sun)
Day of Week Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun
Cash Account Week 5199, etc.

Month Text “99/01 Jan’, ete.

Quarter “99/1”, etc.

The value set in the Cash Account Week field is the same for Thursday to the following
Wednesday. The value is determined for the current highest date and incremented each
following Thursday. When the week number reaches 53 a message box is displayed asking
whether the current year is a 53-week year. If the answer is ‘no’ the week number is set to 1
and the year number incremented. If the answer is ‘yes’ the year is incremented
automatically following week 53.

5.1.1.2 FAD Code Maintenance

This function allows new FAD codes to be added against their associated region code. FAD
codes may also be deleted but only if there are no incidents recorded against it.

5.1.1.3 Resolution Category Maintenance

This function will enable new resolution categories to be added or changed. Categories may
also be deleted provided there are no incidents that reference the category in question.

5.1.1.4 Incident Type Maintenance

This function will allow new Incident Types to be added or changed. It should be noted
however that if a description is amended the change will apply to all previous incidents as
well as new ones. A type may only be deleted if there are no Incidents or Incident Classes
that refer to it.

5.1.1.5 Incident Class and Investigation Cost Maintenance

This function will allow Incident Classes and related Investigation Costs to be maintained. If
there are Incident Classes related to an Incident Type but no incidents that reference the
Incident Class, deleting the Incident Class will allow the incident type to be deleted.

An investigation cost may be specified for an Incident Class, to be applied from a specific
date. A cost may be deleted provided the effective date is in the future.

5.1.1.6 I Transaction Label Maintenance

This function will allow a set of labels to be maintained for use in formatting transaction
information. It will be possible to delete a label from this table even if there are transactions
on the system that reference it. The table provides a list of currently agreed headings which
may change with time. It must be possible to take a label out of use by deleting it from the
table whilst retaining its presence in any Incident for which it was valid.

Company In Confidence Date: 21/11/01

5.1.1.7 User Maintenance

This function will allow the names of MSU analysts to be added to the Analyst table. The
analyst name is recorded each time an update is made to an incident. The system knows the
analyst’s NT Username, the table is used to translate it into his/her real name. It also defines
the status of valid users, either Analyst or Supervisor. Some functions are accessible only to
users with Supervisor status.

5.1.2 Incident Maintenance

5.1.2.1 Access Permissions

Primary access to the service is via NT Username and password. In addition a user will only
be allowed access to the function if his/her name has been set up in the Analysts table. This
is needed so that the NT Username can be translated into a proper name when the system
automatically records the analyst responsible for entering incident details.

5.1.2.2. Operational Details

The incident maintenance function comprises a single screen with a set of tabs giving access
to the various sections of incident detail. The basic details of the incident appear on every
tab. The first tab contains the summary information, including dates and references. The
remaining tabs give access to the repeating information, namely logged actions, transactions,
affected outlets, settlement information and evidence.

Navigation through the incident data will be via a set of buttons with the following functions:

New - create new incident;

Cancel New - cancel incident being created;

Get First - go to first incident;

Get Previous - go to previous incident;

Get Next - go to next incident (note this will not give a blank record
at end of file but will remain at last record);

Get Last - go to last incident;

Find by Field - go to first record with the value specified in the field
specified;

Find next - go to next record with field value specified;

Save - save the updates just made;

Print - produce a print of the current incident;

Export to Word - produces a Word document for the current incident.

Exit - exit to main menu.

These buttons are accessible from each of the tabs.

On Entry to the maintenance function a pop-up screen appears listing any incident whose
SLA expires today (see later paragraph, Last Day Reminder).

Action Log Tab

BIM S - Incident Maintenance

This tab is the means of recording actions taken during the active life of the incident. The
relevant action type is selected and any associated notes entered. For certain action types a
pop-up screen appears to collect additional information. The analyst’s name and date/time of
entry are inserted automatically. Access to the complete set of actions for an incident is via
the navigation buttons.

The actions provided are listed below. Where an action is described as requiring supervisor
status the status of the user is checked against the Analyst table to ensure the correct authority

is held.

Describe Incident — allows additional information to be entered if Incident
Class doesn’t fully describe it. Must be the first action used and can only be
used once.

Update Incident — used to record information gathered as the investigation
proceeds. May be used at any stage after the incident has been described until
it has been cleared.

Suspend SLA — requires supervisor status. Used to suspend the Service Level
Agreement where circumstances arise that have been agreed with POCL. A
pop-up screen appears to capture the suspend date which defaults to today.
This action cannot be used if an SLA period has not been set and cannot be
used more than once. May be used at any stage after the incident has been
described until it has been cleared.

5.1.2.6 Transactions Tab

This tab allows details of transactions related to the incident in question to be recorded. Up
to 20 variable text fields may be entered each related to a variable label field. The labels can
be selected from the user-maintained TXN Labels table or can be entered directly. Whilst the
table provides a set of currently agreed headings which should normally be used, there may
be occasions when an alternative is needed. For each new transaction after the first for an
incident the label fields are defaulted from the previous transaction. A cost can be entered for
each transaction. The sum of the costs for all transactions for the incident is used to populate
the MER Settlement Amount on the Settlement tab.

Transaction Transactions table

The relationship in the original model between the Incident and Outlet entities has now been
identified as many to many. This has resulted in the need for an additional table, Affected
Outlets. Also three tables have been introduced for system control purposes, namely
Analysts, TXN Labels and Switchboard Items.

The content of each table is described below. The primary key of each table is highlighted.

No additional networking services will be required for stage one of the implementation. The
application to be implemented will be a direct replacement for the existing RED database and
will be sited and accessed in the same way, using the standard network facilities available to
customer services staff.

5.6 Platforms

The application to be implemented at stage one consists of a Microsoft Access database, sited
on the customer services drive on the ‘Svbra0Ipwe2n2’ server, accessed via a separate
Microsoft Access client, also resident on the server.

6.0 Systems Management

System management will be carried out at two levels. Backups of the database will be
provided by the standard backup procedures for the server. Responsibility for managing
recovery and other housekeeping will rest with Customer Services MSU staff. Deletion of
obsolete data will be carried out by a bespoke function invoked from the application user
menu; compacting/reorganisation of the front-end database will also be available as a user
function.

The database will be split, separating the data from the application. This will protect the
tables from accidental structure changes and simplify potential software updates. If for any
reason back-end database is moved the links held in the front-end database will have to be
refreshed using the Linked Table Manager Add-in.

7.0 Application Development

The application will be developed in Microsoft Access, based on the existing prototype.
Consequently no Low Level Design Document will be produced.

8.0 System Qualities
8.1 Availability

8.1.1 Resilience

The service will be available during the normal working day. Backup of the service will be
provided by the normal server backup procedures. The backup procedures are described
below.

Monday - Thursday a differential backup is run which backs up the following devices
E$, M$ and the Registry. The same job is run on all 4 servers within the Cluster.

Friday a Full backup is run on Friday which backs up the following devices C$, E$
M$ and the Registry. The same job is run on all 4 servers within the Cluster.

Backups are started at 2000hours. If any of the files are currently in use by any
applications the ARCServe will NOT back the file up. When the job has finished the
Last Result in the job queue will display Incomplete, this signifies that some files
were not backed up due to the fact they were in use.

In order that the service is backed up daily it is imperative that the service is closed down
completely by all users at close of business.
8.1.2 Recovery

Should it be necessary to recover the system from back-up tapes the following points should
be noted:

1. The service comprises two parts, the back-end database and the front-end application.

2. If no software updates have been carried out since the last recoverable dump it is only
necessary to restore the part of the system which is in error.

3. If software updates have taken place it is essential that both parts of the service are
recovered from the same date, or at least from dumps where it is known that the
application and tables are in step.

8.1.3 Support

Support is provided in the first instance by the Workplace 2000 Helpdesk. Where a software
error is identified in the application, i.e. excluding user-created queries, etc., support will be
provided by the Internal Infrastructure team of Pathway Development.

8.2 Usability

The system has been designed with input from the user in order that the MSU’s working
practises are adequately supported. The system will be menu-driven for ease of use. The

functionality provided is largely self-explanatory although a user guide will also be provided
giving guidance on how to use the various screens, navigation controls, etc.

Pessimistic locking will be implemented to prevent users carrying out updates which cannot
subsequently be committed. Note: this can also prevent users from editing adjacent or nearby
incidents. It was felt that this would be preferable to allowing two users to work on the same
incident concurrently.

8.3 Performance

No specific performance criteria have been defined for the application. The forecast volumes
were taken into account when the decision to use Microsoft Access was made and were
considered to be within the limits which give acceptable performance. The functions will be
built to give good response times wherever possible. Certain functions, such as housekeeping
facilities, as a result of the need to scan large parts of the database, may take a significant
time to run. Increase in run times should be kept to a minimum by regularly compacting the
database, particularly the front-end. Both of these tasks should be carried out at start of day
to allow for minimum data loss in the case of failure.

8.4 Security

The first level of security for BIMS is provided by the location in which it will implemented.
It will reside on a local server within the Customer Services environment which consists of a
secure office within a secure building.

At the next level the MSU has its own folder structure within the Customer Services drive to
which only authorised MSU staff have access. BIMS will reside within this structure.
Access to the service will be controlled by NT username and password. Compliance with
JARS requires regular password changes to be enforced as per standard build and ideally the
build should also utilise the facility of obfuscating passwords in the registry.

All MSU staff need the ability to create queries and also have authority to update most of the
tables. Consequently there are very few limitations on data access that could be put in place.
Since it is virtually impossible to prevent someone with the correct NT permissions from
gaining access to full Microsoft Access functionality (or updating via other Microsoft
utilities) should they really wish to, it was felt that the aim should be to discourage
experiment and prevent accidents where possible.

Bespoke functionality has been provided for all tasks to be undertaken, removing the need for
tables to be updated directly. Two levels of authority have been created within the service to
enable functionality to be classified for use by all staff or solely for supervisor use. The
system checks the status of the user when any of the restricted facilities is selected. A custom
menu bar will be provided with a reduced set of standard facilities to avoid update queries
being generated, tasks being fired off by accident, etc.

With regard to the hard-copy output of incidents it must ensured that manual procedures
including handling, storage, disposal and contingency arrangements are catered for.

8.5 Potential For Change

It is not envisaged that changes will be required to the design. Allowance has been made for
user defined data to be recorded in those areas where information requirements are less
certain.

An upgrade to the service will be required when the users migrate to Office 2000. Care will
be required when this occurs as the Office 97 version cannot be accessed by Office 2000
users and the Office 2000 version will not be accessible to Office 97 users.

The Outlet table will be pre-loaded with a complete set of FAD codes. Further Maintenance
will be the responsibility of the user — no attempt will be made to maintain the Outlet table
automatically.

9.0 Solution Implementation Strategy

The total solution to the MSU’s requirements will be implemented in two stages. The first
stage, as documented in this version of the design specification, consists of the main
application, which replaces the functionality currently provided by the RED database. This
will give the users the ability to log, track and print incident details and to monitor SLA
status. Analysis facilities will be available via Business Objects, as at present.

The second stage of the implementation (yet to be specified) will provide a facility to deliver
electronic incident reports to POCL. This will be part of an overall solution to cover delivery
of all of MSU’s requirements for reporting to POCL.

10.0 Risks and Timescales
10.1 Risks

The design has been produced on the basis of the forecast volumes. If these are exceeded by
any significant amount there is a risk that the service will degrade. Also, once the system is
in steady state (after 18 months), housekeeping and database compacting will need to be
carried out on a regular basis to prevent degradation.

10.2 Timescales

The service needs to go live at the beginning of a calendar month to enable the MSU to
rationalise its monthly reporting. With the resumption of roll-out implementation of the
service needs to be carried out as soon as possible.
