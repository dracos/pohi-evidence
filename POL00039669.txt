SUBJECT: HORIZON - UPDATE ON ‘LATEST’!

You may have seen my e-mail of yesterday afternoon to keep you up to speed, pre-case. As
it said, Mena and I did have dinner with George McCorkell and Peter Crahan last night, and
some issues did emerge. Mena is ‘flying’ around today, but will try to touch base with you
at some point to fill in details. I’m on leave today (flying to Germany), but thought I'd give
you key points.

KEY POINTS Ke
« ONGVT
He's going to HMT this morning to update - he worries about labour!

. ON PATHWAY:

The technical release slippage is a cause of major concern for BA, not so much for its
direct impact but because it is a “very poor” signal of ICL’s capability, so soon after a
re-plan. There is a big meeting later today with Bennett, McCorkell, PDA and Mena.
George intends to take a tough line to put culpability on ICL for this delay and force
them to come back with an acceptable plan (which Peter has ‘in his back pocket’). The
issues for us will not be commercial this time, but we will insist on acceptance of trial
not being done over Xmas!!! This may mean EPOS/ APS being a bit later. We'll
see how Pathway react- they could-be into penalties too, if we call it (we'll say we will
for now). :

. ON FUTURE OF PDA
George is keen to pare down PDA quickly and it sounds to me there are some
opportunities here for us. He's realised too that detailed ‘field’ planning is best done
within BA - what a surprise!

° ON POCL AND INSTALLATION ISSUES
He didn’t play this hard. Except to say that BA have a legitimate interest in this (he’s

right) and may raise it at PSC next week. We'll be ready to say how seriously we're
taking it ete.....

Also Colin Baker rang me yesterday. He wants some words to say at his conference about
roll-out. I explained DSS paranoia etc. Mena will provide today.
