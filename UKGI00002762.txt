With thanks to Peter and with significant help from POL, please find attached the pack for the Westminster Hall
debate on Wednesday. Also thanks to Re for the postal regulation lines.

A few points to note:

© We have provided a briefing note, with a number of annexes including a modular speech and Q&A

® Depending on how quickly Jo speaks, the speech could be around 15 minutes long. It does however address
many of the points we expect MPs to raise, and given that we have a 90 minute debate to cover, I would
imagine that such a length would be ok.

e I have also attached Sir Anthony Hooper’s letter (which itself has an annex). If Jo is to lay it, we need to ask
permission. I would be happy to ask on her behalf, otherwise there is an email address on the letter itself
(please cc me).

¢ — I will let you know who from POL is attending tomorrow.

® On the basis that this debate has been triggered by the Horizon issue specifically, I have not incorporated
matters related to postal regulation etc in to the main speech, but it is here in an annex if required.

Kind regards
Richard
