1.0 Introduction

The Network Banking Prosecution Support Service was introduced in response to Network
Banking Requirements 260 and 315. The scope of the Service is outlined in CS/SER/016.

This document was intended to assist the management and delivery of the service necessary
to support Post Office Ltd in respect of criminal prosecution or civil litigation for the Horizon
solution.

Audit Record Query requests are received, documented, extracted from the Audit Archive
and progressed to resolution, as is the production of evidence and witness statements in
support of prosecutions.

This document is without prejudice to any of the parties and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed or construed as affecting contractual obligations or creating new contractual
obligations between any of the parties.

FUJITSU SUPPORT SERVICE FOR AUDIT RECORD Version: 2.1

2.0 Scope

This document sets out the procedures to be adopted by the Royal Mail Group Account’s
Prosecution Support Section (PSS) for managing and dealing with Audit Record Queries
(ARQs) for investigation and prosecution support purposes, including the:

¢ Undertaking of ARQs;

e Presentation of transaction records extracted by ARQs;

e Analysis of appropriate records and logs;

¢ Preparation of witness statements of fact in relation to ARQs;

e Attendance at Court by relevant employees to give evidence in respect of witness
statements;

e Undertaking of additional litigation/prosecution support activities as may be requested on
a case-by-case basis on the instruction of Legal Counsel.

It is recognised that it is not always possible to deliver a standardised response to all
prosecution related ARQs. However, a comprehensive set of standard data information
requests have been agreed and have proven to satisfy the majority of cases. The exceptions
are dealt with on a case by case basis. These procedures can therefore provide a flexible
approach to the provision of prosecution support.

ARQs in support of potential prosecutions will be obtained solely from the Horizon System
Audit Archive / Server. The method by which the integrity of this data is protected is
described in the Audit Trail Functional Specification. Evidence in support of data integrity
will be sourced from Audit Archive / Server and the Royal Mail Group Account’s business
logs. All access to audit data is restricted to named individuals via dedicated workstations
located in a secure environment. Supporting evidence is sourced from relevant business
records and logs.

Requests for Information will fall into two general categories:
a Audit Record Query

This involves the extraction from the audit archive of records relating to data for a
particular outlet.

a Witness Statement.

This request requires the provision of a witness statement of fact in support of data
extracted or records reviewed.

7.1 Audit Record Query

TAA Identify Search Criteria

The team member allocated to the request shall identify the search criteria from the ARQ
form.

712 Create Audit trail of request

The Horizon Audit System provides an audit trail. The audit trail records the date and time of
each process carried out on the Horizon Audit System to complete the ARQ. The search
criteria and ARQ identifier shall be used to create the directory structure of each audit trail.
An audit trail is produced only when an ARQ is marked as completed on the Extractor Client.
(The audit trail is not the Prosecution Support Database). The audit trail is used to attest to
the integrity of data held on the Horizon Audit System and data extracted for ARQs.

The Prosecution Support Database holds information relating to when the ARQ was received,
the SLA return date, who completed the request, when they started and completed the
request, who checked the data and when the disc was sent to POL.

TAS Search for files required to complete request

A search for files required to complete the request shall be initiated using the audit extractor
GUL.

7.14 Select and retrieve files

Once the search has completed and returned the results each required file shall be marked for
selection and then selection will be initiated. Files extracted to the server shall be seal
checked as they are extracted. This check confirms that the data has not been altered from
the time the transaction first originated to the time it was stored. After the files have been
extracted the operator shall check the seal status and ensure all seals match.

TAS Generate messagestore
A messagestore of the selected files shall be initiated on the operator’s local machine using
the files extracted to the audit server.

7.16 Rquery to spreadsheet

Once the messagestore has been successfully generated, the Rquery tool shall be used to
select the files as per the search criteria set out in the ARQ. The Transaction records
extracted for the ARQ are exported by the Rquery tool to an Excel 97 Format.

717 Encryption of Data

It is a mandatory requirement of PCI that all sensitive data communicated either by disc or e-
mail is to be encrypted. The PGP SDA Encryption tool has been selected as the most
appropriate. All data supplied by CS Security will be subject to PGP Encryption. Full details
can be found in IA/PRO/004.

718 Burn closed CD-W

Once the data is complete and formatted it shall be burnt to ‘closed’ CD-W along with a word
document that shall provide an explanation of the format in which the data is provided. The
CD-W will be labelled, and written on the label shall be the ARQ reference number, the
Branch name and code, the SLA due date, the name of the PSS employee who compiled the
data and the date it was completed, the date range requested and the name of the PSS
employee who checked the data and the date on which it was checked.

719 Virus and Data check

The word document held in the ARQ directory on the CD-W shall also contain reference to
the anti virus software used to check the CD-W. The CD-W shall be checked for viruses
after the data has been written to it and before sending it to Post Office Ltd. The retrieved
data is checked by another member of the PSS team prior to despatch.

7.1.10 Despatch

The CD-W shall be sent to the POL Casework Manager by Royal Mail’s Special Delivery
Service. Appropriate packaging for the CD-W will be used to help protect against damage in
transit.

7.2 Prosecution Support

Quotas for all Prosecution Support activities shall be as referenced in the Service Description
for the Security Management Service CS/SER/-16.

721 Check Horizon System Helpdesk Logs

Problems or faults at a Post Office outlet logged with the Horizon System Helpdesk may be
required by POL and if so, logs will be examined using the search criteria specified in an
ARQ to assess whether the outlet was functioning effectively.

The logs are accessed through the web-based program, TFS. PSS shall use the specified
outlet and date range as requested in the ARQ search criteria to search TFS for any calls
logged for the outlet in the date range required. The log of calls to the Horizon System

provided in evidence. The contents of these statements may vary depending on the specific
requirements of the case and the knowledge of the witness providing the statement.
However, a standard witness statement of fact has been agreed with POL and is provided at
Appendix 2. The standard ‘Side B’ document which accompanies all witness statements is
provided at Appendix 3.

7.2.4.2. Court attendance in support of a Witness Statement of Fact

8.0 Additional Prosecution Support

There may be occasions when information is requested which exceed that provided by the
standard Prosecution Support Service. This shall be dealt with on a case by case basis and in
accordance with the Change Control Procedure.

8.1 Audit Record Queries

ARQ retrievals beyond that specified under contract shall be agreed on a case-by-case basis
and shall be dealt with in accordance with Change Control Procedures.

8.2 Expert Witness Statement

To offer all the available evidence without it being requested would only serve to flood the
courtroom with documentation. For this reason expert in depth analysis and detailed “expert”
witness statements (as opposed to witness statements of fact) are rarely required.

It is however conceivable that in certain cases the prosecution may require detailed analysis
of a certain issue or function of the system and, given the size and complexity of the Horizon
System, it may be necessary to call upon the assistance of an expert in that field. In these
cases additional, granular detail about the technical working and integrity of various systems
that constitute the Horizon System may be required.

Expert witnesses could comprise anyone within the Royal Mail Group Account or it’s
approved contractors who could be called upon to provide and testify to this additional
evidence.

Expert witnesses could be called upon to provide for example:

Q Operational logs and shift hand over documentation to demonstrate consistent operation
