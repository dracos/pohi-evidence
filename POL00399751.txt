SISD Programme Issues

EUC Admin Rollout Issues

+ Laptop Availability - Ongoing issue due to a lack of BAU laptops for new starters.
Existing model was unavailable to order and a new model has had to be procured. Order
fulfilment should commence week commencing 25th April, for the current backlog.
Sufficient stock levels will then be maintained to able the BAU service levels to be
achieved.

+ Network Drives/File Shares - The migration of the File Shares form the RMG
environment was completed and subsequently a number of teams have had access
issues.

+ Software Licensing / Installation - not all Applications have been packaged in SCCM
for deployment via the Service Catalogue

+ Atos access to AD - Access has not yet been provided for the Atos Service Desk to the

Computacenter environment, which means that Atos cannot perform a number of first ®
time fix activities. &

Risk Management —- Top 2 Based on
Impact to Service

Horizon
Configuration Error on Branch Database
Secondary

Risk Description - As a result of the
backplane issues on the primary array and
having to failover to the secondary database.
There is an Issue that the configuration of the
database is incorrect. Which will and has
resulted in a complete Branch Horizon outage
across the entire POL estate, resulting in
financial losses to Post Office and customer
dissatisfaction.

Mitigation - Oracle to release and review
configuration settings in order for the
databases to align. This will then need
retesting.

Status Update - Fujitsu to retest weekend of
29Apri6 and run for a period of a week from
the secondary database.

4 Horizon Capacity >»
CDP, APS & Vocalink

Risk Description - As a result of the monthly
transactional volumes consistently breaching
the RAG Amber target for the last 6+ months.
There is a Risk that the transaction volumes
could exceed the agreed contractual limits and
possibly causing issues/failures within the
Fujitsu environment. This could result in POL
not being able to accept/complete credit/debit
card payments and/or bank
deposit/withdrawals, loss of Web CDP services
including Moneygram and possibly causing
issues/failures with PODG APS Transactions.
Also any recovery SLA’s surrounding these
services will be managed on an endeavors
basis if the services were to fail due to limit
breaches.

Mitigation - Post Office to agree to an
increase in these Transaction Volumes via the
Change Request Process so that Fujitsu can
impact assess, agree and implement the
necessary increases.

Status Update - POL IT supplier Management
are aware. However the Change Request has

yet been raised by POL.

+ Speed to Answer (Telephone) down from 83.90% to 77.13%
Speed to Answer (Email) down from 97.00% to 88.17%

Both SLAs were predominately impacted by an increase in demand resulting from the EUC Admin rollout. This
resulted in volumes being 10% above those forecast for the month.

A further impact was the unpredictable call arrival pattern experienced at the Service Desk.

The gentleman that just helped me out was
actually incredibly helpful in comparison to every
other time I've called. So just thank you very
much for all his help that rectified the problem
straight away without having to escalate for the
first time ever and so I appreciate it. Thank
you.(8706863)

3 hours on the phone while ‘working from home’.
No fix. Daily calls to ask I work from home again so
they can meet the 3-day SLA. A bit nuts.

The service received today was absolutely fantastic.
Thank you so much. (8698197)

I found the advisor unapproachable and very rude
and very sarcastic towards the caller as well and I
think you can do with some extra coaching on him
and his call and telephone manner. (8758581)

Yeah I'm very, very satisfied and it looks like the
issue has been resolved. I'm sorry I didn't catch
your colleagues name but he happen to be
extremely helpful. So thank you very
much.(8764228)

Gentleman was very helpful, we resolved the
problem very quickly he was very patient and yes,
will be happy to deal with this gentleman again.

Service received from Helpdesk in Manila was
appalling. It took them 7 days before requesting
authorisation for the new router and only then
because I chased it. It was also apparent that
“information” I received was lifted straight from the
pages of Hanson Christian Anderson. In contrast UK

service was very good. (8746137) Do

and was really good and sorted out the problem.
Thank you. (8710737)

I think there is a language barrier there )
somewhere, they cannot understand me, I
cannot really understand what they are saying,
we have got the same problem we have had for
six months and nobody is doing anything about
it, so yes I think your service is very poor. Thank
you. (8819721)

The incident was raised on 19th Feb and was >
sent to BT for resolution (but this is an issue with
the homepage and not specific to me). Despite
repeated escalation by me and others, nothing
happened until today and that was only because
it was escalated to a senior ATOS colleague
yesterday. So happy with that individual, but
otherwise the whole experience was very
poor.(8641423)
