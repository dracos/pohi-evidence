Post Office shall promptly reimburse to Fujitsu Services all costs reasonably incurred
by Fujitsu Services in correcting any Not Data Errors to which paragraph 3.6.4.1

Data Errors discovered before transmission

Subject to paragraph 3.6.5.4 below, if Fujitsu Services discovers a Transaction Error
which is a Data Error prior to the relevant record being transmitted by Fujitsu
Services to Post Office over the TIP interface, then Fujitsu Services shall not transmit
the relevant record but shall retain it and:

a) correct the Transaction Error in the relevant record;

b) _ transmit the Repaired Transaction Data to Post Office over the TIP interface;
and

c) promptly issue a report to Post Office in an agreed format containing an
explanation of the correction made.

If Fujitsu Services discovers any Data Error resulting in an Inaccurate Cash Account
(Data Error) prior to the relevant record being transmitted by Fujitsu Services to Post
Office over the TIP interface then, notwithstanding the presence of such error,
Fujitsu Services shall transmit the relevant record to Post Office over the TIP
interface and thereafter either:-

(a) with Post Office’s agreement (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld)
promptly correct the Data Error in the relevant cash account, transmit the

Fujitsu Services may, instead of retaining and repairing records in accordance with
paragraphs 3.6.5.1 and/or 3.6.5.3 above, promptly issue to Post Office Manual Error
Reports for up to a total of 50 Data Errors relating to any Data Error Counting
Period (or such higher limit as the parties may agree).

Data Errors discovered after transmission

Where a Data Error shall not have been discovered before transmission of the
relevant record to Post Office over the TIP interface, but is subsequently discovered,
the provisions of paragraphs 3.6.5.1 and 3.6.5.3 above shall not apply to such Data
Error. Instead Fujitsu Services shall either:

(a) with Post Office’s agreement (such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld), correct the Transaction Error or, as the case may be, the Data
Error in the relevant cash account, transmit the Repaired Transaction Data or
(without prejudice to paragraph 3.6.6.4 below) Repaired Cash Account to
Post Office over the TIP interface and promptly issue a report to Post Office
containing an explanation of the correction made; or

(b) promptly issue to Post Office a Manual Error Report in respect of that Data
Error.

If the number of Data Errors which are discovered after the transmission of the
relevant record exceeds twenty in any Data Error Counting Period Fujitsu Services
shall, in consultation with Post Office, review the process introduced by the
Accounting Integrity Control Release with a view to enhancing such process in order
to detect the relevant Data Errors prior to transmission of the relevant records and to
identify and correct root causes of such errors.

Any Data Error processed by Fujitsu Services under paragraph 3.6.6.1(b) above
which shall have been discovered after transmission but before the conclusion of the
Data Error Counting Period to which it relates shall count towards the 50 per Data
Error Counting Period limit under paragraph 3.6.5.4 above. However, where a Data
Error is discovered after transmission and after the conclusion of the Data Error
Counting Period to which it relates Fujitsu Services shall be entitled, without thereby
being in breach of paragraph 3.6.5.4 above, to submit a Manual Error Report in
respect thereof in accordance with paragraph 3.6.6. 1(b).

Where paragraph 3.6.5.2(a) or 3.6.6.1(a) above applies, Fujitsu Service’s obligation
to transmit a Repaired Cash Account may be satisfied by transmitting such part of the
Repaired Cash Account as is necessary to correct the Data Error concerned, provided
that such transmission complies with the requirements of the CCD entitled “Pathway
to TIP Application Interface Specification”.

Definitions
Version: 1.0

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 20 Dec 2002

3.6.7 Not Data Errors

Fujitsu Services shall, promptly following discovery of any Not Data Error, issue a
report to Post Office (in the same format as a Manual Error Report) containing a
brief description of the Not Data Error to the extent that it can be identified and shall
co-operate with Post Office and, to the extent that is reasonable, assist Post Office (a)
to investigate and seek to prevent the recurrence of such Not Data Error and (b) to
prevent the production of Cash Accounts which are incorrect as a result of such Not
Data Error.

3.6.8 General Provisions

3.6.8.1 Fujitsu Services undertakes to use all reasonable endeavours, in accordance with the
procedures defined in the CCD entitled “TPS Reconciliation and Incident
Management” (CS/PRO/111), to notify Post Office of the discovery of a Data Error
or Not Data Error on the same day on which such Data Error or Not Data Error is
discovered and shall in any event notify Post Office thereof on the morning of the
Working Day next following the date on which it is discovered.

3.6.8.2 Fujitsu Services undertakes to use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that:

a) the delay between the occurrence of a Data Error (or in the case of a Data Error
detected after the transmission of the relevant record, its detection) and (a) the
issue of a Manual Error Report in respect thereof to Post Office or (b)
transmission of the Repaired Transaction Data or (without prejudice to
paragraph 3.6.6.4) Repaired Cash Account to Post Office over the TIP interface;
or

b) the delay between discovery of a Not Data Error and the issue of a report to Post
Office in relation thereto under paragraph 3.6.7 above

shall not in any such case exceed five working days.

3.6.8.3 Where any such delay as is referred to in paragraph 3.6.8.1 has exceeded, or Fujitsu
Services believes that it is likely to exceed, five days, Fujitsu Services shall
immediately notify Post Office’s Head of Service Management and shall procure that
the Fujitsu Service’s Customer Service Director (or, in his absence, his deputy) is
made available to meet with Post Office’s Head of Service Management (or his
delegate) to discuss the delay within two working Days of such notification.

3.6.8.4. Where Fujitsu Services provides Manual Error Reports it shall provide a separate
Manual Error Report for each Data Error discovered. For this purpose, where a
single error in a cash account is manifested in more than one place in that cash
account it shall be treated as a single Data Error, but two or more different errors in
the same cash account shall be treated as different Data Errors, each requiring a
separate Manual Error Report.

Where Fujitsu Services is required to make an assumption in order to correct a Data
Error and/or present Repaired Transaction Data or a Repaired Cash Account, Fujitsu
Services shall make such assumption and promptly inform Post Office of the
assumption made.

Fujitsu Services shall pay to Post Office within 30 days after the end of each month a
sum to compensate Post Office for its costs in dealing with Manual Error Reports for
Data Errors as follows:

i. £150 per Manual Error Report relating to a Transaction Error discovered after
transmission of the relevant record;

ii. £100 per Manual Error Report relating to a Transaction Error discovered
before transmission of the relevant record;

iii. £100 per Manual Error Report relating to a Cash Account Error discovered;
and

iv. £100 per Manual Error Report relating to an Inaccurate Cash Account (Data
Error)

in that month. [Clause 802 of the Codified Agreement] shall apply to such payments
as though they were liquidated damages for failure to meet Service Levels.

For the purposes of calculating any sum which may be due to be paid to Post Office
under paragraphs 3.6.4.3 or 3.6.8.6 all Data Errors which shall have been corrected
by Fujitsu Services and the relevant Repaired Transaction Data or (without prejudice
to paragraph 3.6.6.4) Repaired Cash Account transmitted to Post Office over the TIP
interface within five Working Days of such Data Error occurring shall be excluded
and no payment shall be made to Post Office in relation to such Data Errors.

For such period (if any) following discovery of any error or inaccuracy during which
there is insufficient information for Fujitsu Services to determine whether such error
or inaccuracy constitutes, or gives rise to, a Data Error or a Not Data Error, such
error or inaccuracy shall, for the purposes of any action to be taken under
paragraphs 3.6.5 to 3.6.7 (inclusive) above but not otherwise, be treated as a Data
Error.

NOTES

General — Interpretation of the above matrix

The columns headed ‘Incident’ define the incidents which the Defences and AIC Detection are designed to address.
Each of the TIP Incident Numbers refers to the incident number given to the first occurrence of the incident of that type.

The columns headed ‘Defences’ summarise the defences which have (or will be) put in place to deal with the relevant incidents. In some cases it will be
seen that there is more than one category of defence. These are additive layers of system resilience, and should be interpreted as follows:

If there is a root cause fix, then defensive code, if also present, would not be exercised unless either the root cause fix was found in some circumstances
to be ineffective or another hitherto undiscovered root cause caused the same symptom. Taking for example A6, the cause of the missing timestamp
underlying the reported incident has been fixed, and so the second defence (the repair of the defective record by the harvester) is inactive, but would be
activated by some new "bug" which also caused a missing timestamp.

The harvester rejection is described as a defence because it prevents defective records reaching TIP. If there is cither a root cause fix or defensive code
executed at the desk top then the harvester will not reject the record, as records reaching the harvester will be correct. The harvester would reject the
record if the fix failed (and indeed for most transaction errors did originally reject the records, which was how the error was detected by TIP).

The columns headed ‘AIC detection’ set out the reaction the AIC would have made to the various categories of reported errors had it been active at the
time. Where these errors have been cither fixed or defended against the AIC will of course not now have anything to detect. The third defence,

harvester rejection, itself causes AIC detection, as quite apart from anything else which the AIC may have detected it will now also detect that a record
which was present at the counter has not reached the host.

1. This bug resulted in transactions not being generated. The transactions which were in the message store were correctly brought to account.

2. The underlying incident is now understood and can be reproduced. The error does not occur in the CSR+ code and work continues to understand
how to resolve the issue in the current code.

3. This incident type may result in a failure of the service level referred to in paragraph 3.1 of this CCD but is not a Data Error as the relevant data
are rejected at the TIP interface.

4. Root cause was a migration error. The reported error is the secondary effect of the centrally introduced migration correction not being harvested
to TIP, although the cash account was corrected as requested by Post Office.

5. Root cause was incomplete definition of signage agreed between Pathway and TIP, now complete.

6. "Defences" - definitions of terms used as column headings.

The intended purpose of each of the defensive measures referred to in the column headings is described in the definitions below.
Root cause fix means a software fix applied to rectify the cause of the incidents reported by TIP in the relevant categories.

Preventative Code means code added to the Horizon software cither to detect and prevent an inappropriate user action (such as deletion of an
active stock unit) which would have adverse system consequences, or to detect a system error (such as a null cash account id) and prevent the
effects of that error propagating through the system.

Harvester Record Rejection refers to the action taken by the software agent which harvests records to be sent to TIP when it detects a record as
being in error. In this circumstance the agent refuses to harvest the record, instead reporting it for investigation and/or correction.

7. AIC Detection - definition of terms used as column headings:

The checks performed by each part of the AIC software will be as defined in PI/DES/002, which was re-issued at v0.8 on 22/12/99. This adds to
v0.7 a new section 4.6.5, which describes the test performed by the host AIC software to detect and report on instances when the cash account
payments table total does not equal the cash account receipts table total.

Daily checks at the counter refers to the error reporting performed daily by the counter software (by writing error messages in the message store
for central recovery and reporting) as distinct from the daily production of control totals for subsequent use either by the host or by the weekly
counter AIC processes. This reporting is described in PI/DES/002, particularly within sections 3.2, 4.1.3, and 4.3.4 .

Reported by the Harvester refers to the daily error reporting by the harvester agent, for those Branches where an End of Day marker is present,
when records are found which cannot be harvested for onwards transmission to TIP because they fail validation checks. This reporting is
described in PI/DES/002, particularly within sections 4.4.1, and 4.3.4.

Daily checks at the Host refers to reporting of errors detected when the host AIC software checks the data harvested for each Branch with the
counter generated control totals placed in the message store for this purpose. This reporting is described in PI/DES/002, particularly within
sections 3.1 and 4.5.1.

Weekly checks at the counter refers to the error reporting performed weekly by the counter software (by writing error messages in the message
store for central recovery and reporting) as distinct from the production of weekly control totals for subsequent use by the host AIC processes.
These errors may be detected by comparison of the cash account to the control figures accumulated daily at the counter. This reporting occurs
every day, for those Branches for which a cash account has been produced and is described in PI/DES/002, particularly within sections 3.2, 3.4,
4.1.2, 4.1.5, 4.2.3 and 4.3.5.

Weekly checks at the Host refers to reporting of errors detected when the host AIC software checks the cash account sub-file for a Branch with
the counter generated control totals placed in the message store for this purpose. This reporting occurs every day, for those Branches for which a
cash account has been produced and is described in PI/DES/002, particularly within sections 3.3 and 4.5.2.

Receipts not equal to Payments check refers to reporting of errors detected when the host AIC software checks the cash account sub-file for an
Branch to ensure that the totals for the Payments table and the Receipts table contained within the sub-file are equal. This reporting is described in
PI/DES/002, section 4.6.5

Preventative code is being developed.

9. This will not cause errors in the Post Office domain provided the corrected data is transmitted electronically within five working days of the
occurrence of the error. In cases where a Manual Error Report is submitted within five working days of the occurrence of the error Post Office
will be able to use this to correct the following week’s opening balance as well as the original error.
