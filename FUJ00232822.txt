HU) PROGRAMME

«Assigned a named point of contact to help coordinate POL's HU improvement initiatives
e Whilst this was being formulated by POL, Fujitsu delivered a POL focussed Postmaster First
improvements initiative to jointly address several issues:
o SME knowledge sessions on POL selected subjects to enhance POL understanding
© Aligned CBIF with HDR if August 2021 to consolidate views of defects (see HDR
below)
© Offered guidance and teaching sessions on POL reconciliation actions (POL never
responded)
o Supported POL high-level discussions on UAT
© Reviewed and contributed to POL planning around its test strategy, test policy and
regression testing approach (see TESTING)
© Supported POL in its thinking of its new governance model

HORIZON DEFECTS REVIEW (HDR'

¢ Fujitsu introduced Horizon Known Error Review Forum (HKERF) in late 2018 to provide POL with
early visibility of branch impacting defects
© POLconsidered ending this in 2019 (Martin Godbold)

e In 2018, Fujitsu introduced internal weekly review of any new Knowledge Base Articles that
could potentially refer to defects to ensure a Peak/Incident was in place if needed and POL
notification of the Peak was provided where branch impacting. This fed into the HKERF.

°. This evolved to be more system driven in May/June 2021
= Now Peak/Incident tag driven

LIVE DEFECT MANAGEMENT

Continuous improvement focus — not a new activity
e Agreed definition of Live Defect and branch impacting with POL
e Fujitsu now provides a weekly report on all branch impacting defects to POL weekly as well as
attending the POL weekly meeting to review progress
Shored up the internal Live Defect Management processes to enable process analysis and
reporting — making several changes within teams to improve efficiency
°

« Added features to the TfSNow and Peak toolsets to enable better management of Live Defects &
HDR Defects to enable greater visibility for POL

«Ran workshops with all support, development, test and release management teams to embed
improved processes

Changed model for Live Defect delivery to include option for a rapid deployment option.
Although highly manual we now convene sessions to consider rapid deployment and have
offered at least 2 to POL in September 2021 (not taken up)

TITLE: POA IMPROVEMENTS LOG (WIP)

Defined a role for a Defect/Quality Manager and identified an internal candidate to transition
from 1* January 2022

Introduced monthly review and report to POL of any Incidents closed where POL could consider
process improvements or enhancement requests to improved error repellence

PRIVILEGED ACCOUNT IMPROVEMENTS

.

Reviewed assignments of user accounts with elevated privileges and rationalised it from 56 to 34
in Q2 2021

Introduced additional weekly reporting for POL on PAM account status — May 2021. This is also
now part of the monthly SecOps report to POL

Enhanced the monthly PAM verification processes to record more evidence of actions taken —
updates applied to SVM/SDM/PRO/0012

From November 2021 the monthly SecOps report included activity related to the releases of
“breakglass” accounts by POA SecOps — mentioned in RTQSRO003429 and offered by Fujitsu

° itsu I kly

From November 2021 the monthly SecOps report included activity related to failed remote
connections to the Horizon SSNs — mentioned in RTQSRO003429 and offered by Fujitsu
Introduced additional monthly reporting in H2 2020 of numerous types of physical and user
account privileged usage in the monthly SecOps report to give POL greater visibility — Fujitsu
initiated

ENQUIRY SUPPORT

Introduced a simple enquiry mailbox for POL and its legal representatives and assigned a multi-
skilled team to be available to review and actions (PO.Enquiries@ and the channels we proposed
prior to this)

Offered to work with POL to check it is using all of the Horizon content it has access to to best
support an inquiry from a postmaster. Interactions ongoing with POL actions frequently being
the cause of the delays/lack of pace

APPSUP

Removed the default privilege APPSUP on BRDB under MSC 043J0451867 on 18.10.2016 at 18:00
and made it an on-demand controlled allocation of temporary rights

Transaction Correction Process. APPSUP is used for non-balance impacting actions (such as stock
unit associations, emergency branch opening, or monthly tidying of despatch reports). Some
APPSUP actions can indirectly lead to a balance impact (such as deleting a corrupt recovery
message that is causing a logon loop). Where an action being taken by Fujitsu using APPSUP
could lead to a balance impact, it is POL that decide if any balance discrepancy correction is
required with the branch and it is POL that take any corrective action required.
© Note: APPSUP can be used to correct branch balance discrepancies and to amend financial
transactions but a decision was made, but not documented or dated, that Fujitsu would NOT use the
privilege to do this. A note is being added to any current work instructions and KBAs to ensure it is

clearly stated that we do not use APPSUP for that purpose and that that has been the case for many
years

* Implemented a new jointly defined and agreed process for APPSUP usage in May 2021 (f

Data ng that ensures a new POL approval process can be integrated and evidence
of action taken provided

RISK MANAGEMENT

¢ Continued process improvements to the account risk management processes to ensure greater
alignment and clearer action tracking across all areas

e Enhanced risk management with POL - expanding it to cover all domains

e Fujitsu leads the joint POL owned account monthly risk management review call — driving POL to
take actions required

©  Digitised the delivery of ARQ responses. This is underway under CWO0426 but has been

extremely delayed by POL procuring, installing and configuring the required desktop PGP
software

AUDIT ARCHIVE

Provided POL with a full list of data available to them in the Audit Archive - to support POL's
postmaster investigation processes

e Enhanced the ARQ query process to align it to the contents of the Audit Archive by using a menu
system on the request form to make it much easier for POL to request Audit Archive data

entire delivery mechanism from POL product managers/owners to scrum team engineers

GOVERNANCE/COMPLIANCE

¢ A Weekly Priority Meeting was requested by Fujitsu and introduced in April 2019 to enable
POL to clearly its priorities — face to face — so Fujitsu could be clear on the context and ask
questions to avoid any confusion from emails, meetings, and other ad-hoc discussions
© Additionally this helps POL stakeholders to be aware of the breadth of activities that
Fujitsu are undertaking.

e Fujitsu assisted POL to confirm that all 62 issues comprising the 29 BEDs cited in the Horizon
Issues were closed. This was successful
e With the appointment of a new POL Head of Test we have introduced a more collaborative
approach to testing. Each release now has a joint test team POL/Fujitsu/Any appropriate 3rd
party to discuss/agree scope of activities for the changes under test.
© Good examples of this were the 29 BED testing, PRE-PAID MI and Computacenter
Data Centre migration where we worked closely with POL Test / Accenture / KPMG /
CC to complete these activities
e We have contributed to the Post Office Test Strategy, Test Policy and Regression testing
approach to help shape testing process at all levels
« We made many recommendations in the TESTING & QA REPORT as part of the Horizon Audit

MONITORING

The following HORIce graphs were introduce (following Incident reviews). They are used to
assess impact/observe symptoms of ongoing live issues and are used by Service Management
«These are visible to POL on its HORIce dashboard

Figure 1: This is looking at the BMX metrics for Java heap memory
interface) to detail the number of completed file transfers

in the HBS (kiosk) servers. If the Java cannot free used memory
quickly enough it leads to issues

BlueCoat-ProxyS6, it is looking for a specific error text ‘Scheme
was not delimited’ that can affect kiosks

REPORTING

Horizon Defect weekly reporting
