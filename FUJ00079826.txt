ICL End-to-End Customer Complaint Process __ Ref: CS/PRD/o81
Pathway
Version: 1.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 05/09/2000

1.0 Introduction

The purpose of this document is to identify how ICL Pathway CS, Post Office
Network NBSC, and ICL OSD HSH receive, manage and resolve customer
complaints effectively in a cross organisational business environment.

2.0 Scope

The definition of an end to end process in this document is from the receipt of a
complaint at any customer contact point, to resolution of a complaint
regardless of the inter-organisational boundaries involved.

In this context a customer complaint is taken to mean a deliberate expression of
dissatisfaction with components of the Horizon system or the services provided
to support the Horizon system.

The majority of complaints originate at the Post Office outlet, the customer
being the end user of the Horizon system. (e.g. PM).

Complaints may be raised verbally by telephone call or word of mouth, or by
letter, email, fax or an Engineer Visit Reply Card. All complaints received
should be accepted and treated as valid and justified until proven otherwise.

Each complaint and the process itself should be monitored at each stage against
agreed measures (OLA). This will ensure that complaints are resolved in an
acceptable timescale, and that the process itself is subjected to scrutiny.

Most complaints are currently received by telephone at one of the Helpdesks,
the majority being reported to the NBSC Helpdesk. The NBSC Helpdesk has
requested that the prime customer interface for complaints received by this
route should be the NBSC. Therefore all responses to complaints received by
the NBSC, should be communicated to the complainant through the NBSC
even where the resolution actions are carried out by one of the other
organisations.

The focus of this document is on handling and resolution of complaints by ICL
Pathway CS, and its service suppliers. No attempt is made to explain internal
Post Office Network processes beyond the NBSC procedures.

4.0 Procedures for handling complainty

Handling complaints across organisational boundaries is achieved by aligning existing
local procedures to produce an end to end process. The focus of this document is on
the front end procedures [1 to 3], where most complaints will be resolved. By exception
some complaints will reveal problems that are serious enough to require escalation to
the highest level of the organsation. ICL Pathway already has problem management
[8], escalation [7] and corporate red alert [9] procedures that can be invoked for
complaints when necessary.

6.0 Complaint Routing

The great majority of complaints will be received by a telephone call to the
NBSC or HSH Helpdesks, but a small number will be received directly by ICL
Pathway CS.

It is important that complaints are efficiently routed to the owning organisation
for investigation. The routing charts shown in section 6.1 to 6.3 are for all
complaints received by the NBSC, HSH and Pathway CS.

* Note:

If Pathway receives complaint about HORIZON system functionality, it will be
necessary for Pathway to decide if the complaint originates from the system not
operating to specification, or if the complainant is requesting an enhancement of
the system. In the later case, the complainant will be referred to the NBSC to log
an improvement suggestion.

Type Codes are used within the HSH Powerhelp system to identify complaints
(problem types). Currently only MCo1 to MCos are defined, but a change request
has been raised to withdraw code MCo2 (Complaint about HSH/SMC) and
replace it with a range of codes MCo8 to MCi2 to align with the NBSC sub
activities. CS/FSP/oo2 gives more detail on the proposed change.

7.0 Escalation.

When a complaint has serious implications or cannot be resolved it should be
escalated so that the appropriate resources can be allocated to the problem.

FUJ00079826

Leve I Escalation for visibility and Escalation criteria
1 action
° ICL Pathway CS Complaint Team I Pathway Complaint Procedure.
1 ICL Pathway Customer Service A complaint requires management
Management Team action (e.g. unsatisfied
complainant)
2 ICL Pathway Directorates Complaint is unresolved at a lower
Pathway Alert level and having a significant
impact on the project.
3 ICL CSAC Complaint is unresolved at a lower
ICL Customer Red Alert Procedure level and having critical impact on
the project, or one of the following:
Health and safety risk.
Data loss or data corruption.
Risk of legal proceedings.

Fixed timescales are not relevant to the escalation of a complaint, as each complaint
will be raised to the level of escalation required to resolve it. Details of the escalation
of complaints are documented in the Pathway Complaints/Escalation Process [6 & 7].

Currently Pathway CS has a stand-alone database to log complaints received directly
from the customer. Complaints are transferred to Pathway CS from the NBSC and
HSH Helpdesks by email. This activity could be greatly improved if Pathway CS were
to implement a local Powerhelp stack, enabling complaint call details to be efficiently
passed between Pathway CS and the HSH Helpdesk.
