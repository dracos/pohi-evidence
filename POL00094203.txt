Reporting Offences to the Police (NPA Procedures)

1. Introduction

11 These Procedures and Standards, (P&S) describe the process which must be followed to ensure that
the police in England and Wales are notified of the initiation of criminal proceedings against those
prosecuted by Royal Mail Group Ltd (RMG Ltd) and the disposal of those proceedings at Court. The
police require this information to enable them to update the “Phoenix National Criminal Justice
Record Service’.

1.2 These P&S do not apply to Scotland or Northern Ireland as prosecutions within these jurisdictions
are not undertaken by RMG Ltd.

1.3 To notify the police of proceedings we use forms which have been designed by the Association of
Chief Police Officers (ACPO), Disclosure Group. The standard forms have been designed for all Non
Police Agencies (NPA) and are known as “NPA forms”. The three forms in use are as follows;

1.3.1 NPA 01 - Notification of Proceedings to Police.

1.3.2 NPA 02 - Notification of Proceedings to Police (continuation).

1.3.3. NPA 03 - Notification of Disposal to Police.

These forms can be found on the RM Security Sharepoint site under Investigation and Prosecution
Forms.

1.4 Within Royal Mail Security (RMS) the reporting of offences to the police is undertaken by the
Prosecution Support Office (PSO); however the Investigator in the Case (IC) is responsible for
completing the NPA 01 form.

2. The NPA Reporting Process

2.1 The NPA 01 - Notification of Proceedings to Police. In any case where a suspect offender is informed
that they may have rendered themselves liable to prosecution or they are charged with offences at a
police station the IIC must ensure that an NPA 01 is completed. The form should be completed at the
time that the suspect is informed they may be prosecuted or a decision is made to charge them. It is
also best practice to complete the Antecedents form GS033 at the same time. Guidance on
completion of the NPA 01 form is given in Section 3 below.

2.2 The requirement for the IIC to complete the NPA 01 stands even if the police complete there own
Phoenix National Criminal Justice Record Service forms. In addition if a suspect is in custody the IIC
should also:

2.2.1 Obtain the Arrest or Summons (A/S) Reference Number for inclusion on the NPA 01 form.

2.2.2 Obtain a copy of police charge sheet and a copy of any previous convictions (these should be
associated with the NPA 01 form).

2.2.3 Ensure that the suspect offender has provided fingerprint and DNA samples and had their
photograph taken. (In cases prosecuted by RMG Ltd by way of summons the PSO will write to
the police on conviction to request the above are obtained in accordance with Section 27 of
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984).

2.3 On the submission of a Suspected Offender Case file the NPA 01 form should then be enclosed in
Appendix B with any relevant documents associated.

2.4 The PSO will complete all other NPA documentation and obtain, if it has not already been obtained,
a printout of the suspect's previous convictions at the relevant time as the case progresses.

3. Guidelines on completing the NPA 01.
