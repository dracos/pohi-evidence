               The Post Office Limited (POL) network of approximately 11,000 branches processes client and business transactions in excess of Â£100 billion annually. The
               majority of transactions are conducted on behalf of third parties, for example, receiving payment for domestic utility bills and paying out from National Savings
               accounts.

               Customer transactions are captured on the Horizon (HNGX) electronic point of sale system in branches and transmitted to central systems (utility payment,
               external banking and POLfinance systems) throughout the day. Overnight, daily summaries are transferred into the central accounting system, POL SAP. The
               translation process between the two systems is enabled by the Reference Data System (RDS). An overview of the component parts of the HNGX system is
               provided at Appendix A.

               The overall objective of the review was to provide assurance that appropriate IT management disciplines provide a stable IT platform, and that suitable internal
               controls operate over HNGX transactions and the extraction of these for central systems. In the area of management disciplines the review assessed controls
               over: access to software; change management; capacity monitoring; and system resilience and disaster recovery. With regards to internal controls over
               transactions the review covered: master data controls; transaction data; SAP Middleware; and batch updates.
               The review also assessed the degree to which actions to address the issifps r     Fthe 2011 Ernst & Young (E&Y) Management Letter regarding the HNGX
                                                                                           V//

               The following control weaknesses were identified:

               1.     System access: Access to HNGX in branches is by means of individual user accounts and passwords. However, particularly in sub-post offices, the same user
                      accounts and passwords are often shared between branch staff. The use of individual user accounts is not always practical, e.g. in the case of single
                      terminal branches where time would be lost continually switching between user accounts, and the number and geographical spread of sub-post offces
                      makes it difficult for POL management to ensure access controls are enforced.
                      Implication: The audit trailfor identifying the source of any transaction discrepancies could be unreliable.
               2.     Resilience and Disaster Recovery: Fail-over from the live data centre to the back-up has not been tested since June 2009, although disaster recovery
                      arrangements were tested during the migration to the new system in October 2009. Testing of the business continuity plan has been scheduled for the 24`^
                      and 2511 of March 2012.
                      Implication: The period of any inability to trade as a result of a major system outage moy be greater than anticipated.

                3.       Master data: No audit trail exists for change requests received by Fujitsu from the Network Business Support Centre (NBSC). Not all 'approved' requesters
                         are documented or referred to on receipt of a change request. The membership of the Lotus Notes email groups, which are used to authorise the Master
                         Data Teams to make changes to standing data, is not known and has not been subject to recent review. One of a sample of 10 change requests was found
                         to have been handled via the "Fast track" process when it should have comethrough the normal process, resulting in reduced oversight of the change.
                         Implication: It is difficult to detect and prevent inappropriate changes being made to master data.
                4.       Transaction data: One of a sample of 5 monthly reconciliations between HNGX generated client transaction summaries and those created by the clients
                         themselves was found not to have a second level review signature. Period-end Senior Management review is not formally signed-off, although it appears to
                         be undertaken.
                         Implication: Errors may not be identified, leading to possible discrepancies in client balances.

               Conclusion: IT disciplines around functional changes and capacity monitoring were found to be appropriately designed and also operating effectively. However,
               access to the system in branches, particularly sub-post offices, can be by means of shared accouri .`'In addition, fail-over from the live data centre to the back-up
               centre has not been tested since June 2009. This requirement is of particular importance, as highlighted by an outage in the system in December 2011. Testing
               of the business continuity plan has been scheduled for March 2012; Controls designed to maintain the completeness, accuracy and integrity of transactional data
               flows within HNGX were effective, with minor weaknesses noted around manual prddesses for the validation of master kiata and transaction data. No evidence
               was found of material discrepancies arising from these issues.

               Control Environment: Some improvement required.

               The 2011 E&Y Management Letter identified a numFb r f areas f1o~F1Jmproving HNGX and other POL IT system controls. This current Internal Audit & Risk
               Management (IA&RM) review assessed the degree to &inich Hsanagement action plans have progressed to address the issues which related to HNGX. Progress
               has been made in completing the<actions arising from the E&Y Management Letter. The E&Y recommendations that require most additional work relate to,
               inappropriate access to software change management duties (incomplete segregation between software development and migration roles); the process forthe
               identification and resolution of incidents; the recommendations that POL undertakes an architectural review, configure passwords in line with policy and perform
               periodic scan of passwords as part of a penetration testing schedule. The penetration testing originally planned for January 2012 has been postponed to March
               2012 as the business had to prioritise a test to meet Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance duringJanuary.
               The findings, summarised in Appendix B on page 9, have been shared with E&Y and reflect our assessment as at the end of January 2012.
