Dear Lady Neville-Rolfe
Post Office Limited - retention of documents

Further to the discussions we have had with your officials yesterday at the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, I confirm the undertakings previously
given on behalf of Post Office Limited (‘POL’) regarding the preservation of materials
relating to applicants in the scheme set up by POL to investigate individual complaints
about Horizon.

In particular:

* Paula Vennells, POL Chief Executive Officer, stated to the BIS Select
Committee on 3 February 2015 that Post Office Limited has preserved, and will
continue to preserve, all materials relating to the Complaint Review and
Mediation Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) and the applicants in that Scheme, and

* Tundertook to the Criminal Cases Review Commission that POL would comply
with its statutory duty to preserve all material considered as part of the
Scheme to investigate individual complaints about Horizon. This includes (i) all
documentation held by Second Sight Support Services Limited to our order; (ii)
all materials relating to applications for participation in the mediation scheme,
and (iii) all materials held by our solicitors relating to the cases considered as
part of the Scheme.

Further, as set out in my recent correspondence with Second Sight Support Services
Limited, I confirm that any materials returned to Post Office by them following
conclusion of their investigations, will be preserved. These materials will be held by
our solicitors Bond Dickinson.
