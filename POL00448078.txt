CI) 4 Shortfalls

Assurance Review Overall Rating

CIJ 4 whilst labelled Shortfalls also includes Loss Prevention and Transaction Disputes

- 53 unique actions of which 2 related to HIJ and have been excluded from the scope of the review.

- 37 (70%) actions are complete and can be demonstrated via evidence

- 14 (26%) actions require improvements, 5 of the original actions have not been completed. A further 9 actions were duplicates.

Whilst there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate the actions delivered and their sustainability, the key areas in our opinion which would need
strengthening is the monitoring of shortfalls on an E2E basis and assessing the impacts the CIJ actions are having from a PM lens (for example there
is no visibility at GE level for the number of aged discrepancies that are currently outstanding, metrics for remittances returned, counterfeit risks,
branch closures discrepancies, obsolete stock.)

Discrepancies

Create and end-to-end view of discrepancies identified at Swindon
and reported through to Chesterfield to enable monitoring of
impact on Postmasters (both positive and negative).
