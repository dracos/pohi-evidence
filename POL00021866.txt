I spoke to Belinda earlier — we are going to raise this point on the next WG call. By doing this, we can put the issue direct
to JFSA and press Alan to explain why his comments are unsuitable to be disclosed to PO (eg. has he written something
embarrassing or in bad faith?).

To be fair to SS, they are kind of stuck between JFSA and POL on this one.

Kind regards
Andy

I'm with Rodric on this one. SS cannot be relying on information to make decisions that it is not fairly disclosed to Post
Office and the Applicants - in lan's favourite words, this is a basic principle of natural justice - the right to see the evidence
against you. Either the JFSA comments need to be disclosed or SS should undertake not to rely on them.

Kind regards
Andy

SS are putting their independence at risk if they do not disclose material which informs their opinion.

We shld keep pushing for this (they haven't outright refused), but it may need to wait until we see what their "final"

report looks like.

You will appreciate that I can only share JFSA comments with you, if JFSA consent to me doing so.
I have put the question to them this afternoon and they have not provided the necessary consent.
lam therefore unable to share the JFSA comments with you at this stage.

Dear Ron and lan,

lrefer to my letter to you dated 14 August 2014, attached to Belinda's email below.

Can you please let me know by return how you propose addressing the matters raised in my letter, and within what
specific timeframe - I am conscious that the Working Group Chair has asked for the "Part Two Report" to be sent to
Applicants during the course of this week

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,
