Subject: PRINTED SubPostmasters and 2nd Sight

Dear Paula,

I have just completed a very good meeting with Ron and Ian from 2" Sight, and Alan Bates from the Justice
for SubPostmasters Alliance. Mr Bates was accompanied by a forensic accountant, Miss Kay Linnell. Both
asked some challenging questions of Ron and Ian, which they answered to Mr Bates’ and Miss Linnell’s
satisfaction.

However the other MPs and I take the view - which I think you share - that so far as we can we should ensure
that as the investigation goes on it retains the buy-in of the sub-Postmasters. To this end I should be grateful
if you would agree to setting aside a small amount of money (capped at £5,000) for a forensic accountant
nominated by the Alliance (likely to be Miss Linnell) to carry out sporadic review of 2"¢ Sights findings. We
discussed this at the meeting, and felt it would be the key to the entire process working for everyone — my
constituents and those of other MPs, the SubPostmasters, and of course the Post Office and its reputation.

I should be most interested to hear your thoughts.
