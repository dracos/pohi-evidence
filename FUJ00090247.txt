1.0 Introduction

This document is one of a set of three documents that describe the changes to the Horizon
User Interfaces resulting from the introduction of Impact Release 3 at the Post Office counter
(at BI3 $80). Each of the three documents covers a distinct set of requirements that are
documented in the high-level process models within the Conceptual Design EA/CDE/002

Each process within the requirements document is depicted by a reference beginning with the
letter ‘A’. ‘The requirements that have an impact on the Graphical User Interface, Reports or
Receipts are documented below:

1.1 Report Production

This is covered in EA/FS/011 - Impact Release 3 - Report Production User Interface which
covers the following topics:

* A4.1.2.2 Produce Periodic Summaries

removed reports and changes to report selection criteria,

*  A4.1.2.3 Produce Sales Report to Assist Remuneration Check
New functionality around the entry and validation of reporting criteria.

* 4.1.2.6 Produce Other Horizon Reports

as well as changes to the Office Rollover process.

+ A4.1.7.6 Produce and Confirm Trading Statement

rollover confirmation

1.4 Scope

This document describes the changes to the flow of activities, screen displays and prompts,
and report/receipt layouts at the counter a result of the introduction of Impact Release 3. This
document shall limit that description to those items listed under section 1.2 above.

‘The primary purpose of the flow charts in this document is to define the User Interface, and in
some cases, to define the sequence of screens displayed. They are not intended to be
definitive statements of the low-level design of the counter application.

This is a delta document that only describes changes incurred as a result of the
implementation of Impact Release 3. This document does not intend to narrate any part of the
system that exists at Release $75 and which remains unchanged as a result of Impact Release
3.

This document covers all aspects of the timeliness of change to the User Interfaces as a result
of the necessity to migrate the counter functionality across more than one migration boundary.

Itis felt that standard dialogues that show progress (for example: ‘Print in progress’) or show
failure of peripherals would simply confuse the readability of this document. Therefore, not
all of the possible error or exception conditions are shown or described within the diagrams
and dialogues within this document.

1.4.1 DP Cross Reference

‘The scope of this document can be further defined by cross-reference to the Impact Release 3
Design Proposal EA/DPR/004. ‘This document covers the following sections of the Design

1.4.2 Migration Points
The migration to the new dialogues at Release $80 will occur at three points.

a The first point occurs when the counter software and associated reference data is
distributed and made available to the Branches. With reference to TBA, this
migration point is referred to as “Point 20”

a The second point occurs when the final cash account is produced for the CBDB
accounting system and will have an effect on the Menu Hierarchy as well as incurring
some changes to the number and type of suspense products. With reference to TBA,
this migration point is referred to as ‘Point 30°

a The third point occurs when the final cash account occurs at the Branch and this phase
incurs the majority of the changes described within this document. With reference to
TBA, this migration point is referred to as ‘Point 50”

1.5 Structure of this document
This document is structured as follows:

Section 2 provides the list of new or changed User Interfaces that are within the scope of this
document. Where the dialogue involves more than one Screen (alternatively known as
‘Form’ or “Tablet’), then there is a top-level flow chart that depicts the interactions and routes
between the Screens.

Section 3 provides the layout of the Office and Customer Receipts and Reports that are new
or have changed and are within the scope of this document.

Section 4 shows the Screen layouts for any Screens that are new or have been impacted by the
changes within the scope of this document.

2.0 Graphical User Interface Design

The transaction flows in this section describe the points at which screens are displayed to the
Clerk. Although automated processes are shown within the diagrams, they are for clarity only
and do not attempt to fully or accurately show the underlying logic of transaction processing.
The Screens are used to inform and prompt the Clerk at appropriate steps in the process of
each transaction.

2.1 Overview

This document describes the User Interfaces that are required to support Declaration,
Correction and Revaluation. In summary, this includes:

a Stock Revaluation

a Cash Declaration and Cash Variance Check
a Cash Variance Report

a Stock Declaration (No change)

a Cash Declaration Logon Reminder

a Transaction Corrections Logon Reminder
a Process Transaction Corrections

a Transaction Corrections Report

2.1.1 Stock Processing

This section covers the changes necessary to support the processing of stock by volume rather
than by value. It also describes the impact of merging the distinction between value and non-
value stock. All changes to the stock processing described in this section will be
implemented at migration Point 50.

2.1.1.1 Remittances and Transfers

‘The $75 stock remittances and transfers functions generally require volumes to be entered for
stock movements. However, the existing system is capable of handling remittances by value
or by volume. No change is therefore required to the User Interface mechanisms.

2.1.1.2 Stock Revaluation:

The stock revaluation function is no longer required since stock will be handled by volume
rather than by value. However, the existing mechanism of alerting the postmaster of
imminent product revaluations will be retained. This mechanism informs the user of
revaluations at logon, the message that appears will be modified as described in section 4.1.1

‘The mechanism by which stock revaluations were invoked is via the menu hierarchy
(Transactions/Reval-Up, Transactions/Reval-Down). These menu items will be removed as
shown SD/SPE/022 in section “TRAN L2/S1 Transactions’

‘The Counter Daily Revaluation Slip will also be no longer required. ‘This will be removed
(Refer to Section 3.1).

‘September 2004

‘Note: removal of the stock revaluation will deny access to the revaluation of Exceptional
Products (EA/DPR/004 section 2.5.1.1.2.4) and these products will therefore have no
mechanism for revaluation.

Refer to EA/DPR/004 section 2.5.1.1.2.3.

2.1.1.3 Merging Value and Non-Value Stock

It is expected that non-value stock will be changed, via reference data, to appear as
value/volume stock. Alternatively, the non-value stock will be retired as a stock-type
product. However, the requirements for how non-value stock will be processed is not fully
defined in either EA/CDE/002 or EA/DPR/004. There are two options considered in this
document:

1. Ifnon-value stock is retired as a stock product, then no stock processing will be
required within the system and it will be removed.

2. Ifnon-value stock is to be converted to value/volume stock, then the non-value stock
processing will be retired and new menu items will be required to enable these
products to be remitted in/out and transferred out.

Since there are no specific requirements then it is assumed that all Non-value stock
processing functionality will be removed. This involves the removal of the following:

Menu items:

F4/F11 — Non-value stock Declaration (refer to SD/SPE/022 section ‘SBAL
4 Stock Balancing’)
F8/E2 — Confirm Non-Value Stock (refer to SD/SPE/022 section ‘OBAL
1.2/S6 Office Balancing’)
FI/E3/FS/F3/F16 — Remit-Out ADC Non-Value Stock (refer to SD/SPE/022
section “[XFR/REMS L5/S21 Stock’)
Rollover Checks

Since Non-Value stock will no longer be managed by the Horizon system, the
checks for completed Non-Value stock declarations at Stock Unit rollover will
be removed.

Reporting:
All Non-Value Stock Reports will be removed (refer to section 3.2)

2.1.2. Changes to Cash/Stock Declarations and Variance Handling

This section covers the requirements for the removal of the daily Overnight Cash Holding
(ONCH) declaration and the replacement of this with a daily cash declaration and daily cash
variance report, It also describes the new functions for the processing of cash variances,

This section covers all changes to the User Interface as a result of implementing the design
stated in section 2.5.1.2 of EA/DPR/004. All of the changes described within this section will
be implemented at migration Point 20.

2.1.2.1 Changes to Cash Declarations

‘The requirement for Overnight Cash holdings on a daily basis will be replaced by the
requirement to make Cash Declarations on a daily basis. The dialogues for both these
processes are the same, however the underlying functionality is different. The existing
ONCH declaration button will therefore be replaced with the Cash Declaration button (refer
to SD/SPE/022 section ‘REPS L3/S8 Counter Daily’).

It is not expected that the word ‘Discrepancy’ be changed to ‘Variance’ within the Cash
Declaration process.

‘The only-change-4o-the Cash-declaration-process-is-duringFor a Shared Stock Unit
declaration:, -Aa new button will appear on the Report Dialogue that appears at the end of the
declaration process that will allow the user to proceed directly to the ‘Check For Variances’
function described in section 2.1.2.2. The new screen design is shown in section 4.2.1

Where an amount has been Made Good or Excess Cash has been removed from a Stock Unit
(or from a Declaration Id in the case of Shared Stock Units) since the last declaration, then the
net amount Made Good/Removed will be presented to the user. This will be presented on the
declarations screen that is used to enter the denominational amounts of cash. The amount
Made Good or Removed will be presented in the denominational picklist heading. This
heading reads ‘Declare Cash on Hand’ at $75, this will be changed as follows:

If an amount has been made good since the last declaration the title will read:
Declare Cash (£xxxxx.xx Made Good}

ss cash has been removed since the last declaration the title will read:
Declare Cash (£xxxxx.xx Removed)

Ifno adjustment has been made to the declared amount then the title will read:
Declare Cash

Ifexe

Ina shared stock unit where a new declaration is being made, or in an individual stock
unit where this is the first declaration, then the title will read:

Declare Cash

2.1.2.2 Check for Variances

This is a new function that will be available to Shared Stock Units and will be invoked from a
new button ‘Cash Variance’ on the Stock Balancing menu (refer to SD/SPE/022 section’
SBAL L2/S4 Stock Balancing’) or from the Report Dialogue as described above.

The new process will act in a similar manner to the existing Stock Unit balancing function
and will present a list of all cash declarations made within the current Stock Unit.

Acceptance of the list will cause the system to check the sum of the declared cash values with
the system calculated Stock Unit cash value. The user is then informed whether there is a
variance and, if so, the value (+/-) of the variance. Refer to section 2.2 for a description of the
dialogue flows.

This new function may also be invoked from the Cash Declarations report dialogue (refer to
2.1.2.1)

Refer to EA/DPR/004 section 2.5.1.2.1.1

2.1.2.3. Cash Variance Report

A new report will be available that will show all declarations made by each Stock Unit and
any variances that exist between the declared value and the system-calculated value.

‘The new report will be invoked by an additional button on the Office Daily reporting menu
(refer to SD/SPE/022 section ‘REPS L3/S9 Office Daily’). The report will show the data for
the current trading month and week. Refer to section 3.3 for report layout and description.

A re-print function will be made available that will allow re-prints of previous trading
month/weeks. The reprint will be invoked from the Report Reprint Menu (SD/SPE/022
section ‘ REPS L3/S11 Reprints’ and section 4.2.9)

Refer to EA/DPR/004 section 2.5.1.2.2.

2.1.2.4 Cash Variance Processing

Ifa variance exists within any Stock Unit, amendments can be made by either adding cash to
the till or by removing cash from the till until the value of the till and the system-calculated
figures are in agreement.

There is a requirement that these activities are logged within the system and two new
functions will be provided to either Make Good a Loss or Remove Excess Cash. These
functions will be invoked by menu buttons on the stock balancing menu described in
SD/SPE/022 section ‘SBAL L2/S4 Stock Balancing”

The user interface is defined in more detail in sections 2.3, 4.2.10 and 4.2.12.

Refer to EA/DPR/004 section 2.5.1.2.3.

2.1.2.5 Stock Declarations and Variances

The existing mechanism for stock declaration and adjustment will be retained. Although
most stock will now be handled by volume rather than by value this has no impact on the
mechanisms by which declarations and adjustments are performed.

Also, although the optional “Loss Price’ may be used when adjusting stock levels, the user
interface is not visibly different to the existing system. However the price displayed
alongside a product will be the Loss Price rather than the Sale Price (if the product reference
data has a loss price specified against it).

Refer to EA/DPR/004 section 2.5.1.2.4.

2.1.2.6 Cash Declaration Check

‘The S75 counter performs a check at Logon that the ONCH declaration for the current Stock
Unit has been performed for the previous Trading Day. If the ONCH declaration had not
been performed for the previous Trading Date, a message will be displayed to inform the
clerk that an ONCH declaration must be made and the clerk is forced into the ONCH Declare
Cash dialogue.

At S80, the ONCH declaration is removed and replaced by Cash Declarations. At Logon, a
check will be made to determine whether a Cash Declaration has been performed for the
previous Trading Day. If the Cash Declaration had not been performed for the previous
Trading Date, a message will be displayed to inform the clerk that a Cash Declaration is
outstanding. This dialogue will force a Cash Declaration to be made in the same manner as
the ONCH declaration.

Since the logical sequence of the Logon process has not changed (the Cash Declaration
reminder has simply replaced the ONCH reminder), then this document will constrain itself to
the description of the reminder screen only and will not re-describe the full logon process (see
section 4.2.13).

This process will change during migration Point 20.
Refer to EA/DPR/004 section 2.5.1.6.1.

2.1.3 Processing Transaction Corrections

‘This section covers the requirements for the display, selection, processing and reporting of
automated Transaction Corrections. All of the dialogues within this section are only
applicable to those Roles who can do an Office Balance (ie Manager, Supervisor, Migrate,
Auditor and Auditor - Emergency Manager). This will be controlled using normal Menu
Security functionality and reference data.

This section covers all changes to the User Interface as a result of implementing the design
stated in section 2.5.1.6.3 and 2.5.1.7 of EA/DPR/004.

2.1.3.1 Transaction Correction Check

At Logon, a new check will be made to determine whether there are any outstanding
Transaction Corrections. This new check will be performed after the check for Cash.
Declarations described in section 2.1.2.6 and will be the last check to be made as part of the
Logon process.

If there are outstanding Transaction Corrections a message will be displayed to inform the
Postmaster that one or more Transaction Corrections are outstanding. This dialogue will
allow the Postmaster to choose whether to process the Corrections now or will allow the
Postmaster to continue with the Logon process. This check will only be made for users of
role Manager or Supervisor

Since this new dialogue is simply an additional check within an existing process, then this
document will constrain itself to the description of the reminder screen only and will not re-
describe the full logon process (see section 4.3.1)

This check will be implemented as part of migration Point 50.
Refer to EA/DPR/004 section 2.5.1.6.1.

2.1.3.2 Selecting and Processing Transaction Corrections

A new dialogue will be introduced to process automated Transaction Corrections that are
distributed to Branches by the new financial system. The dialogue will be invoked as a result
of Transaction Corrections being outstanding at the point of user logon or by touching the
appropriate menu button (SD/SPE/022 section ‘HKPG L3/S5 Housekeeping’).

A list of all outstanding transaction corrections will be presented to the user. A transaction
correction may then be selected and the detail of the correction may then be viewed. Within
the transaction correction detail screen, a number of options will be made available for the
user to choose from in order to action the transaction correction. In certain circumstances, a
further options screen will be presented (see section 4.3.5). In addition, a cancel button will
be available should the user decide not to process the transaction correction at this time.
Refer to section 2.4 for a diagram of the process flow and sections 4.3.4 and 4.3.5 for screen
layouts and descriptions.

Refer to EA/DPR/004 section 2.5.1.7.1 and 2.5.1.7.2.

2.1.3.3. Reporting on Transaction Corrections

Two new buttons will be available on the main reporting menu that will invoke the
transaction corrections reports (refer to SD/SPE/022 section ‘REPS L2/S2 Reports’). One of
the buttons will be used to invoke the Outstanding Transaction Corrections report and the
other will be used to invoke the Processed ‘Transaction Corrections report. Each will invoke a
dialogue that will request the start and end dates to define the scope of the report (refer to
4.3.8)

3.0 Reports and Receipts

This section depicts the layout of the Reports and Receipts following the introduction of
requirements introduced by the Impact Release 3 Conceptual design (Fujitsu reference
EA/CDE/002) and constrained to the functionality described in section 1.2.

It should be noted that the examples below attempt to reflect the final formats of the Reports
and Receipts although changes to layouts depicted below may or may not be incurred by other
influences or requirement changes. The definitive statement of Report and Receipt layout is
documented in SD/DES/005.

3.1 Counter Daily Revaluation Slip

Since stock is to be treated by Volume, the mechanisms for revaluation and the reporting of
revaluations is no longer required. This report will be removed at migration Point 50.

[ Note: This assumption may be incorrect if some stock products still require revaluations _I

3.2 Non-Value Stock Reports

Since Non-Value Stock will no longer be managed by the Horizon system, the following
Non-Value Stock reports will be removed.

a Non-Value Declaration for Shared SU

a Non-Value Declaration for Individual SU

a Non-Value Confirmation Report

These reports will be removed at migration Point 50.
3.3. Cash Variance Report
3.3.1 Purpose

This is an office report and provides a comparison between declared values of cash with the
derived values of cash across all stock units within the Branch. The total value of
adjustments within the branch and number of transaction corrections made complement the
figures to provide an office-wide picture of the Branch cash position.

3.3.2 Frequency

Manually invoked on a daily basis from the Office Daily menu (Refer to SD/SPE/022 section
‘REPS 1.3/S9 Office Daily’). Reports may be reprinted for previous weeks by using the
Report Reprint menu button (Refer to SD/SPE/022 section ‘REPS L3/S11 Reprints’)

3.3.3 Notes
Optional
Details of the cash declarations made within each Stock Unit across a period.

previous week.

The report does not attempt to align to a Trading Period. The report simply shows the cash
declared, derived and variances for the current week (or previous weeks for re-prints)

‘The report will not show any data for the current day since the calculation of the figures is

3.3.6.3 Variances, Derived and Declared Figures and SU Breakdowns Declarations

‘The Cash Variance for any day is the difference between the Derived and Declared figures for
each Stock Unit.

The derived figures represent the system-calculated cash total at the time the declaration was
made. The time of declaration for a Shared Stock Unit is assumed to be the time when the
Check for Variances process was performed. If trading has occurred between the time the
declaration has been made and the time the Check for Variance function is executed, then it is
expected that there will be a variance between the declared and the derived figures

‘The declared figures are the values declared on the day, or are the values declared on the
previous day if the stock unit was not logged-on in the day. For Shared Stock Units, the
declared figures are the sum of the declarations of the individual Declaration Ids (tills).

The SU Breakdown section shows the individual Declaration Ids within each of the Shared
Stock Units

Declarations made as part of the log-on process (including those done by an associated Check
for Variances function) will be recorded as having taken place “yesterday”.

3.3.6.4 Known Discrepancies

Two lines show the total values of the ‘Local’ Suspense Account and the sum of the total
values for all ‘Other’ suspense accounts.

3.3.6.5 Adjustments to physical cash on hand

This section shows the total values of all adjustments made on the day. Adjustments are the
nett values recorded as ‘Made Good’ or ‘Excess Cash’ as described in section 2.1.2.4

3.3.6.6 Transaction Corrections

This section reports on the number of Transaction Corrections that have been processed on
each day of the report and the number of Transaction Corrections Outstanding on each day of
the report.

3.3.6.7 Missing Declarations (‘x’)

Where a stock unit has not logged-on on a Trading Date then the figures for the previous day
are used today (or “x” where the previous day shows *x’).

‘An ‘x’ will be shown in a cell of the report if a declaration has not yet been completed for the
Stock Unit on the day in question.

For Shared Stock Units, an ‘x’ will be shown against each Declaration Id for which a
declaration has not been made on the day (in the SU Breakdowns section). When the Check
for Variances function has been run, then the most recent previous declarations will be
brought forward for those tills that have not yet declared and therefore no ‘x’ will be shown
against that Stock Unit. Also, an ‘x’ will appear on the Variance, Derived and Declared
sections of the report until the Check for Variances function has been performed for the

3.4.7 Transaction Corrections Additional Information

The Allowed Options on the Outstanding report refer to the possible choices that the clerk
may have when attempting to process a transaction correction, The Outcome on the
Processed report refers to the actual choice made by the clerk when the correction was

processed. These fields on the report may have one of the following values:

Mode Allowed ID_[ Mode Report Text
MG Make Good ‘Accept Now
HS Assign to Centre Settle centrly
EV Request Evidence Seek Evidence
wo Write Off Send To P&l.
‘AN Assign to Nominee Assign To HO
SW Stock Write On/Off _I Stock WO

In addition, if the Transaction Correction failed due to the constraints applied during
processing (due to inconsistent reference data for example), then the Outcome text would be

shown as “Txn Error’._The settlement product would, in this case, be blank.

Both reports show both Amount and Quantity fields. Each transaction correction will have
either an amount or a quantity (but not both). Zero amount or quantity will therefore be

suppressed and shown as spaces.

‘The description will word-wrap if longer than 126 characters and will wrap on a space
character or a hyphen. Vertical bar characters ‘I’ in the text will be treated as line-feed

characters.

‘The headings will be repeated in full at the start of each page.

3.4.8 Pagination

No special pagination rules will be enforced except that a new page will occur once all lines
have been used on the previous page. There are no obvious rules for pagination since the
number of lines of text accompanying each transaction correction may vary widely.

Following a page-feed, the heading section will be repeated in full.
