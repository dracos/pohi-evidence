1.2 Process Objective

The key objective of the process is to ensure effective and efficient management of Major Incidents,
through:

1.3

Improvements of communication channels.

Clarify the need to communicate awareness of potential incidents

Improved accuracy of reporting against status of incident

Allowing technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident
Avoid unnecessary alerting of the customer

Demonstrate to the Post Office a more professional approach

Provision of clear defined roles and responsibilities

Defined reporting/update timelines through duration of a major incident.

Improved governance

Assessing which incidents are major and which are ‘Business as Usual’

Process Rationale

This document outlines the communication and management process and guidelines to be followed in
relation to Major Incidents impacting the live estate.

The methodology defined within this document augments the existing SMS framework process presently
deployed within the live estate.

The aim of the document is to provide a pre-defined process on which future major incident
communication and management will follow and that any parties involved in that process provide
updates /receive updates at defined intervals from inception to closure of any major service impacts.

Mandatory Guidelines

Whilst it is important to maintain a balance between:

a) Allowing the technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident

b) Avoid unnecessary alerting of the customer

c) Assessing which incidents are major and which are ‘Business as Usual’

The following guidelines should be adhered to.

During HSD Core Hours (Monday — Friday 08:00 - 18:00 and Saturday 08:00 — 14:00) Post
Office Horizon Service Desk should be the first point of contact for operational contact between
Fujitsu and the end user. Outside these hours SMC acts as the first point of contact.

Any activity detailed in this document which is assigned to the HSD is handed over to SMC
outside the HSD Core Hours.

The relevant technical teams who are monitoring and aware of a potential major incident must
page/call the appropriate Fujitsu Service Delivery Manager / Owner (Duty Manager out of hours)
as soon as possible, rather than wait. The Fujitsu Service Delivery Managers are detailed in
Appendix 10.2. This is not limited to major incidents alone, but must be delivered wherever a
state other than Business as Usual has been detected. The Fujitsu Service Delivery Manager /
Owner must in turn communicate the potential incident, to POL SCT for awareness and
monitoring in POL. However this could be done via the HSD IMT.

The Fujitsu Service Delivery Manager / Owner (or Duty Manager out of hours) is responsible for
communicating both up the Fujitsu Organisation and across (see appendix 10.3) to their
counterpart in POL. Where this is impractical (i.e. leave, out of hours, unavailable), the initiative
should be taken to jump up the organisation. The important fact is that the customer is informed
in a timely manner and at the correct touch point. This communication should be by voice or
direct SMS. The communication should include the date, time, name, nature of problem,
severity, if service affecting, likely impact, and the owner for contact.

The Fujitsu Service Delivery Manager / Owner (Duty Manager) should also initiate
communication using SMS via HSD, 08.00 to 18.00 Monday to Friday, and Saturday 08.00 to
14.00. Outside of these hours, SMS should be via SMC.

3 Definition of a Major Incident

3.1 Incident Classification

As a general rule a Major Incident will always be an incident rated as severity level A (critical) in the
RMGA Customer Service Incident Management Process Details document (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018)
version 2.0, or a series of connected lower severity rated Incidents which combine to have a significant
business impact. However not all incidents rated at severity level A qualify. This is because the severity
levels do not necessarily translate to the global business impact on POL’s business. For example a
single counter post office which is unable to transact, regardless of its business volumes is rated as a
Severity A.

For simplicity, Incidents are classified into three impact levels: High, Medium and Low.

High — An Incident that has occurred with a significant and potentially prolonged adverse impact on POL
business. Typically these Incidents will initially require a significant amount of reactive management
before they can be controlled and resolved.

Medium — An Incident that has the potential to cause significant impact to POL business but can be
controlled and mitigated against through effective management.

Low — An Incident that requires business attention but if managed effectively will not have significant
impact on POL business.

3.2 Influencing Factors in calling Major Incident

It is important that a major incident is defined as such, because of its business impact on the day when it
occurs, rather than simply being defined as a major incident because it appears on a list. The following
parameters will also feed into the consideration of whether a major incident exists, as follows:

e Duration i.e. how long has the vulnerability to service already existed

e Impact across the estate, including consideration of whether a service is merely degraded or
actually stopped

e Time at which the event occurs in relation to the 24 hour business day
e Time of year - eg Christmas / Easter / End of month/quarter DVLA

e Anticipated time before service can be resumed

e Impact to POL Branches, customers, clients or brand image

e Business initiatives e.g. product launches

3.3 Major Incident Triggers

The criteria below could trigger a major incident, however as detailed in 3.2, the influencing factors must
be considered. As such the list below can never be exhaustive, whilst if an incident occurs which is not
detailed, this should not be precluded from being a major incident.

4 Calling the Major Incident

During business hours the Service Delivery Manager / Owner responsible for the Primary Service
affected declares Major Incident and is designated the Incident Manager for the duration of the Incident
(with handovers to the Duty Manager where applicable.)

Where the impact of the incident is not immediately obvious, and it is not clear if Major Incident should
be called, escalation and discussion with the Service Delivery / Service Support Team Manager, Head of
Service Management or CS Director should occur, and a collective decision made. If Major Incident is
not called, the incident should be monitored until closure, to ensure that the impact does not increase to
Major Incident.

In the event that multiple Services are impacted, an Incident Manager will be appointed by Service
Delivery / Service Support Team Manager, Head of Service Management or CS Director, who will
remain in this role until incident closure.

Out of hours the Duty Manager is responsible for declaring Major Incident.

7 Formal Incident Closure & Major Incident Review

The purpose of a Major Incident Review is:

1. To understand the Incident that prevented a Service or Services from being delivered.
2. To confirm impact to the business, during and after the Incident and agree number of branches
impacted and duration of Major Incident.
3. To confirm the end-to-end recovery process & timeline and identify that all documented
processes were followed.
4. To analyse the management of the Incident & the effectiveness of the governance process.
5. To identify corrective actions to:
i. prevent recurrence of Incident
ii. minimise future business impact
iii, improve management of Incidents
6. To formally close the Major Incident

Output: To confirm details provided in the draft MIR provided to POL, update with corrective actions and
redistribute. The agreed impact of Major Incident must be sent to Branch Network Service Delivery
Manager for inclusion in the Counter Availability SLT Figures.

If this review highlights areas where improvements can be made, an agreed Service Improvement Plan
will be produced with appropriate actions, owners and timescales. Service Management will track all
actions to resolution. Third party actions will be reviewed at Service Review meetings.

The Agenda for the Major Incident Review is stored on: \\ATCFS7\POcust_serv\01Public\Major Incident
Management \Templates

It is critical that the number of branches impacted and the duration of the Major Incident is agreed at the
Maior Incident Review and this agreement must come from POL. If for some reason POL is not present
at the Major Incident Review meeting, a separate conversation must take place. This information is
fequired because Major Incidents affect Counter Availability and Liquidated Damages (LDs) are paid on
Counter Availability as detailed in 7.1 below.

7.1 Calculating Liquidated Damages payable on Major
Incidents.

Liquidated damages are payable on Major Incidents which qualify as Failure Events as detailed in the
Branch Network Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD0011). Failure Event is defined in this document as
an event or series of connected events which causes one or more Counter Positions to be deemed to be
Unavailable due to a Network Wide Failure or a Local Failure. Ongoing failures will be deemed to be part
of such Failure Event until the Failure Event is closed in accordance with the Incident closure and Major
Incident Review process as detailed in section 7.0.

For a Failure Event the Incident Closure & Major Incident Review Process will require Post Office and
Fujitsu Services to agree the number of Branches and Counter Positions affected and the duration of the
outage;

The duration of the Incident must be agreed with Post Office & rounded to the nearest 30 minutes as
detailed in the Network Wide Rounding Table below

8.3 Service Support Manager — Recovery Manager

8.3.1 Role of the Service Support Manager in Major Incident

The primary functions of the Service Support Manager is to act as Recovery Manager and to co-ordinate
and manage the restoration of Service, focusing on the technical teams and acting as the
communication point for the technical teams and 3 parties.

The Service Support Manager:
* Manages the technical recovery of the Incident — liaising with SDUs & Third Parties.

* Provides updates on the recovery, when technicians / representatives of technical teams are unable to
attend the MI Conference Call.

* Is the only person to liaise directly with the technical teams, including technical third parties.
* Ensures that technical investigative actions are tracked and completed.
* Tracks technical corrective actions through Service Review meetings

In the event of a central infrastructure Major Incident with no impact on the business, the SDM will not be
involved and the SSM will be responsible for chairing any meetings / creation of documentation.

Service Support may well feel the need to schedule a Technical Conference Call, which will have a
technical focus.
