           FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF CAROLA RAMSDEN




I, CAROLA RAMSDEN will say as follows. . .


INTRODUCTION



   1. I was employed by Post Office Ltd from 1986 until September 2006, where

      undertook a number of roles within this time period.

   2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

      with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 3 April 2023.




   3. I began my career as a Post Office Counter Clerk at Keighley Branch Office in

      1986 and would also during my time there cover for the Branch Manager.

                                                                                 WITNO5720100




4. In 1990 I was employed as an Agency Trainer in the Bradford Area office,

   whereby I trained new Subpostmasters in a classroom environment as well as

   at their own branch when they were appointed. This training was all paper

   based.

5. In 1993 after the Post Office reorganisation I was employed as a Training

   Coordinator in Leeds. This involved coordinating and scheduling a number of

   trainers across the region for them to carry out training for new

   Subpostmasters.

6. In 1995 I was promoted to the role of Transactional Knowledge Manager. This

   role involved managing and organizing events in the evenings for

   Subpostmasters to improve their knowledge of transactions. It was delivered

   by means of a computer-based quiz with any gaps in knowledge being

   addressed.

7. From February 1999 to September 2001 I was employed as a Retail Network

   Manager in Bradford and then subsequently in Sheffield when I was promoted

   to CM1 to cover a colleagues sick leave. I was responsible for approximately

   30-50 branches motivating and assisting Subpostmasters to manage their

   branches effectively in a customer friendly way.

8. As part of the Retail Network Manager role I would also be responsible for

   recruiting Subpostmasters as well as taking any disciplinary action if required.

9. In September 2001 after another re-organisation I was employed as a

   Contracts Manager for the Rural Agency Network for the North East Region.

   This role was to maintain the end-to-end recruitment process as well as to

   provide guidance on contractual and remuneration issues to team members

                                                                                   WITNO5720100




   and Heads of Area. I was also responsible for handling legal cases for the

   area liaising with legal services where appropriate. I left this role in June 2004,

10.In 2004 I was employed as an Operations Manager for the Regional Agency

   Network. This role was project based and involved designing processes for

   Mailwork branches; reducing costs to the business by ensuring process were

   in place to reduce cash in the network; Managing, monitoring and controlling

   the budget of the Government fund for the Capital Subsidy start up scheme

   for rural post offices and the flexible fund.

11. My final role was from March 2005 until September 2006 was a Service

   Standards Support Manager/Restrictions Manager, this was a band 9 role. I

   was responsible for the development and review of processes for the service

   teams; responsible for implementation for E Recruitment for Post Office Ltd;

   Providing guidance and advice on contractual matters to line managers.

12.1 have 7 0 levels from school and college.

13.1 can recollect attending in-house training on how to manage people, sales

   training, as well as manager training days. These were throughout my career.

   I also attended conferences where training and team building was provided. In

   the 1990s I undertook an Open University course called the Capable

   Manager. Most of the training within the Post Office was via shadowing and

   mentoring other colleagues who performed the same role.

14.As stated above I was promoted throughout my career from a Post Office

   Clerk to a Senior Band 9.

                                                                                 WITNO5720100




   Contractual liability of Subpostmasters for shortfalls



15. I have been asked to consider the following documents, and answer a number

   questions relating to the Contractual liability of Subpostmasters for shortfalls:

   P0L00083939,       P0L00088904,        P0L00086845,       P0L00088867,       and

   POL00030562.

16. 1 have been asked what the contractual position as to the responsibility for

   SPMs for shortfalls or "losses" identified within their branch was at the

   time I worked for the Post Office, My understanding of the contractual

   obligation for losses within the Subpostmasters branch was that they were

   responsible for making good any losses incurred. This was always defined

   in their contract and also as part of the training process.

17. During my time as both an Agency Trainer, Retail Network Manager and

   Contracts Manager this was always the same.

18. In terms of larger losses Subpostmasters could hold them in the suspense

   account if permission was given by the Retail Network Manager and

   subsequently the Helpline.

19.I have been asked how the Post Office policy on the responsibility of

   employees within Crown Offices for shortfalls and "losses" in a Crown Office

   differed from the policy for SPMS for shortfalls and losses in their branch.

  Having not worked within the Crown Network as a manager my only

  recollection is when I worked on the counter at Keighley Post Office of how

  losses were dealt with is that they were recorded and over a certain limit I

  think it was three or more losses disciplinary action would be taken. I believe

                                                                                     WITN05720100
                                                                                WITNO5720100




    that counter clerks were not responsible for making good the losses whereas

    Subpostmasters were.

20. I am unaware of the disciplinary action taken against Crown Office employees

    for losses or whether legal action was taken as I had never been involved with

    the Crown Office Network and its employees in relation to shortfalls.



   Policies and Practices



21. 1 have been asked to explain the relevant roles I held at the Post Office

   between 1986 and 2006, and my involvement in policies/practices relating to

   error notices, transaction corrections/acknowledgements, branch

   discrepancies and "corrective action" taken against SPMs.

22.As an Agency trainer I would go out to branches following losses and retrain

   Subpostmasters on procedures/processes within the branch. This would be

   because they were receiving error notices from either Chesterfield or the

   Remittance Unit and my role was to ensure they understood why they made

   the errors and knew the correct procedures.

23. 1 was employed as a Retail Network Manager between February 1999 and

   September 2001. During this time I would assist Subpostmasters who had

   error notices to both understand what they were, investigate and try to resolve

   any unknown errors and to ensure they made good losses. I would also on

   occasions assist Subpostmasters who had mis-balanced trying to identify their

   losses and double check their balances on their balancing day.

24. In terms of the investigations undertaken by me as an RNM I would look at all

   the paperwork to try to identify any loss, comparing stock from the current

                                  Page 5 of 12
                                                                                   WITNO5720100
                                                                                WITNO5720100




   week to the previous; recounting stock and cash. Prior to Horizon daily

   documents would have been checked but after Horizon was installed it was

   harder to identify missing documentation as bills etc were electronic.

   Chesterfield and or the remittance unit would also be contacted to ascertain

   whether there were any pending error notices.

25.As a Contracts Manager I would interview Subpostmasters regarding losses

   following an audit. The interviews were investigative interviews following the

   audit whereby the loss was not declared and cash holdings over inflated to

   cover the loss or held in the suspense without authority.

26. The Subpostmaster would be brought into an interview by their Retail Network

   Manager and I would also be in attendance and chair the interview.            A

   Subpostmaster always had the right at interviews to have a colleague or

   National Federation of Subpostamaters representative (NFSP).

27. Following the investigative interview further follow up investigations may have

   been carried out to check what Subpostmasters disputed during interviews or

   if any other information came to light this would be by reviewing the accounts,

   error logs, transaction logs and trying to establish if any error notices had

   come to light.

28. A Subsequent interview would then be conducted by the Retail Network

   Manager and myself to determine the conclusion with an outcome. Again this

   was with a NFSP representative or colleague of the Subpostmaster if they

   requested this.   Following the outcome the Subpostmaster had the right of

   appeal which would be held by a Senior Manager. The outcome of the

   interview could range from no action, a warning, final written warning or

   dismissal.

                                                                                WITNO5720100




   29. 1 have been asked who made the final decision whether to pursue legal

      action. Legal action would I believe be decided between the Head of Area

      and the Post Office Legal team.

   30. 1 was in the Contract Manager role from Sept 2001 - June 2004. I cannot

      recollect any specific incidents regarding error notices but in most cases

      Subpostmasters had not declared the loss but had inflated their cash on hand

      figures to cover up a loss.

   31. If a Subpostmaster disputed a large loss time would be given to allow any

      error notices to come through the system this amount would be held in the

      suspense account. A large loss would usually mean over a couple of hundred

      pounds otherwise the Subpostmaster would have to make good the loss or

      give reasons or prove financial hardship to repay over a period of time. The

      onus was on the Subpostmaster to prove the loss, although as an RNM I

      would try and assist in trying to identify any loss.



Error Notices



   32. I have been asked to consider the following documents and answer a number

      of questions in relation to error notices, transaction corrections and

      acknowledgements         and      branch       discrepancies:   POL00083939,

      P0L000088904,         NFSP00000169,          NFSP00000043,      P0L00085794,

      P0L00030562, P0L00083951, and P0L00083952.

   33.1 have been asked after the introduction of Branch Trading, what an Error

      Notice was. Error Notices were issued by Chesterfield, remittance units and

      National Savings Bank (NSB). Errors were issued prior to Horizon being

                                      Page 7of12
                                                                                    WITNO5720100
                                                                                WITN05720100




   introduced in paper format and would be for example the giro slips, telephone

   stubs or other paperwork not matching to the submitted cash accounts or

   daily summary. Subpostmasters would send in daily transactions to various

   departments and then submit a weekly cash account, if the stubs didn't match

   then an error notice would be issued whether it be in favour or a loss to the

   Subpostmaster.


34. Error notices could also be issued if a customer had complained to Post

   Office Ltd about a bill not being processed and they would have the paper

   receipt with the Subpostmasters date stamp to prove it had been paid.

35.1 have been asked after the introduction of Branch Trading, what a transaction

   correction ("TC") and what a transaction acknowledgement ("TA") was.

   Following the introduction of Horizon these error notices were then called

   transaction corrections which I believe were sent electronically on to the

   system. The transaction correction was an instruction to the Subpostmaster

   of what the error was and a transaction acknowledgement was that they

   acknowledged that error and accepted it as being their error.

36. For both Error notices and Transaction corrections Subpostmasters could

   dispute the error but would need to provide evidence as to why they were

   disputing the error.


37.As part of the balancing process Subpostmasters would declare their loss

   and when signing the cash account they were declaring they had made it

   good.


38. I can not recollect what the amount was for which Subpostmasters could

   settle centrally or what the process was at the time.

                                  Page 8 of 12
                                                                                      WITN05720100
                                                                                     WITNO5720100




IMPACT Proaramme




39. I have been asked about the IMPACT programme, and the role the local

   suspense account played before its removal. I cannot recollect the

   Impact programme, although vaguely remember Subpostmasters not

   having to submit a balance on a weekly basis which had always been the

   case from when I started at the Post Office.

40. If a Subpostmaster was unable to make good the loss due to the amount

   incurred, they could prior to Horizon ask the Retail Network Manager to

   hold it in the suspense account, following Horizon it would be via the

   helpline. As an RNM the loss would be held if there was a potential error

   notice known i.e. the Subpostmaster could identify the error or for further

   investigations to take place.


41.1 cannot recollect what the helpline process was for allowing Subpostmasters

   to put losses in the suspense account but presume it would be the same as

   the the RNM reasons.

42.1 have been asked if "settling centrally" meant acceptance of a debt liability.

   My understanding is that Subpostmasters had to make good all losses under

   the terms of their contract and if they didn't have any evidence to dispute the

   error they would need to make it good. The document POL00026854 was

   after my time at Post Office Ltd so I cannot comment on this document.


                                   Page 9 of 12
                                                                                        WITNO5720100
                                                                                       WITN05720100




   43. I agree that in the majority of cases when a TC or error notice was issued it

      would be the Subpostmaster or their assistants that had made the error. The

      error notices should have been backed up by receipts, evidence when sent

      through to the Subpostmaster.

   44. I left the business in September 2006 so have no knowledge of events after

      that time.



Corrective Action taken against Subpostmasters



   45. I have been asked to consider a memo sent by me to Contract and Service

      Managers, along with other recipients (POL00083945). This document was

      sent out by me as guidance for Contract and Service Managers to improve

      performance in the Agency outlets.

  46.1 have no evidence of any corrective action against Subpostmasters

      following the issue of this document. However it would be expected that the

      managers would discuss any issues with the Subpostmaster and put in an

      action plan/re-training and support to identify any learnings needed to reduce

      the errors.

  47. I cannot now recall the Subpostmasters contract to determine what would

      constitute a material breach of contract as referred to in the para 3.4 in the

      document (POL00083945) but would suggest one as a breach of security.


  48. During all my time as a Manager at the Post Office I was only involved with

      Agency Branches and had no dealings with the Crown Network.


  49. Following an audit where a discrepancy was discovered my role as a
                                     Page 10 of 12
                                                                                   WITNO5720100
                                                                                  WITNO5720100




         contracts Manager was to investigate the loss by checking transaction

         logs, error notices, cash accounts and by interviewing the

         Subpostmaster, My role would also have been to determine any false

         accounting and any penalty as an outcome of the investigation.

  Recovery of Agents Debt



    50. If a Subpostmaster settled centrally then it would have not come to my

         attention unless a discrepancy was found at audit.

   51. Up until I left the Post Office my understanding of the losses and gains

         policy was that Retail Network Managers could write off losses for new

         Subpostmasters or if they had financial hardship and a payment plan

         would be put in place.


   52. I am unaware as to how often relief was given.




Statement of Truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.
