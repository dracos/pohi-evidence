Subject: I RE: Evidence Marine Drive

Brian,

Just been chasing Stephen up re your attendance and any matters still outstanding for us
(POA), as follows; (my words)

He states that although you would probably make a good witness, it is for evidential reasons
that you cannot be called. To do with evidence of ‘opinion’, 'expert' evidence and ‘real’
evidence, etc etc.. (complicated legal issues nothing to do with personalaties)

Fine (I won't try and understand what this means!)

Does this mean I don’t need to be available in December anymore? Presumably it also means that
I don’t have anything further to do with the witness statement that Stephen tried writing for me.

However, PO would like you to liaise with their expert, 'once appointed’ and also to complete
the report you sent to Stephen last week? Stephen will send the cash accounts to you which
apparently you had not received?

Yes, Penny passed me the Cash account for week 42, which Stephen had sent her. It matched the
figures that Anne and I produced.

I’m not sure what Stephen is expecting in terms of “completion of the report”. As far as I am
concerned it is complete for the week 42 data. What else is he after? Should I communicate with
Stephen directly?

I will also be attending the meeting to represent FJ and to pick up on any issues raised for POA
for us.

Please advise if any problems

Regards

Gareth
