Summary of Events
Date/Time Event
26/06/12 Received a call from Paul Clark, FSA who is conducting a cash
1045 assurance check at Glenmoriston visit. The purpose of the

visit was to verify cash on hand because of concerns from the
retail cash management team. Paul reported a cash shortage of
6k in the cash held overnight, he also reported the cash on
hand had been falsified and inflated by the Subpostmasters
daughter who works as an assistant in the branch. I informed
him to conduct a full TIER2 audit as suspension was likely.

1330 Received further call from Paul informing me that he had found
several stock discrepancies in the branch, which creates
several positive corrections to the balance due. Therefore,
the new discrepancy is approximately £1096. I also asked him
to due further checks with the stock centre in Swindon. The
cash on hand has been inflated since the 12/6 by increasing
the £5 note held on hand.

1605 Received a call from Paul Clark FSA informing me that the
final audit shortage is £1090.66. Therefore, in consulation
with John Breeden it has been agreed to withdraw the
suspension decision and deal with this failings as a
performance management case.
