POST OFFICE LTD — CASE REVIEW

R. y. Deborah D’Arcy

Plymouth Crown Court

Offence

1. On the 24" February 2012 this defendant was sentenced to a term of 12
months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with a 150 hour unpaid work
requirement, for an offence of Fraud, contrary to section 1 of The Fraud Act
2006. The single charge alleged that between 1* day of August 2010 and the
23" March 2011 she had falsified the figures in the final branch trading
accounts for Beacon Park Post Office. The alleged loss was £31,389.38. The
defendant pleaded guilty at her PCMH and provided a written basis.

Case history
2. The defendant appeared before the Bradford Magistrates Court on the sh
December 2011. She gave no indication of her plea, but indicated that no
witnesses were required, and the case was cominitied to Plymouth Crown
Court with the PCMH listed, at that time, for the 238 January 2012.

3. The PCMH took place on the 23" January 2012 and the defendant pleaded
guilty as set out in paragraph 1

Prosecution case
4. The defendant Deborah D’Arcy was during the relevant period the sub-
postmistress at the Beacon Park Sub Post Office.

5. On the 23" March 2011 Post Office Limited Auditors attended the Beacon
Park Sub Post Office to conduct an audit. On their arrival the defendant

’

POL-0091365
informed the auditors that she had been expecting them as she was about
£30,000 short. The result of the audit found a deficit in the accounts of
£31,389.38 — which is the alleged loss to the Post Office. The deficit consisted
of a cash loss of £31,700.54, a surplus of £152.57 in the stock figures and a
surplus in the postage of £158.59.

. Post Office Limited investigators were informed and the defendant was
interviewed under caution on the 14" February 2011 in the presence of her

National Federation of Sub postmasters’ representative.

. In her interviews, conducted under the provisions of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984 and the relevant Codes of Practice, the defendant said:

— She took the post office on on the 18 June 2003 and moved into the
premises at that point.

— It was a two ‘position office where she worked with her partner and
Theresa Mavin.

~— She said that, whilst they did not know each other’s passwords, they
had worked under each other’s codes.

— When asked to explain the shortages she explained that they had
swapped to Horizon on line the previous August (August 2010)

— They had shortages from the first week.

— She phoned the helpline to report the matter but could only get a
voicemail —no one got back to her...

— The losses accrued at £1,000 to £2000 per week.

— This continued until November when it had become an unmanageable
amount...

- She was still only getting voicemail on the helpline. .

— This continued until the arrival of the auditors. She was putting her
house and the Post Office on the market.

— She was altering the cash on the Branch trading statements each
Wednesday “to make it look right.”

- She did not think that the shortages were down to Theresa.

Defence case

8. In interview the defendant indicated that she did not know how the losses

arose but that they only started after the switch to Horizon on Line. She

complained that the helpline was always on voicemail and that no one got
back to her,

Discussion

9. Throughout her interview the defendant sought to rely for her defence on what

she assumed to be failings on the part of Horizon, coupled with a lack of

customer support. I deal with each in turn:

Horizon

Had the Second Sight Interim report been available to us during the
currency of this prosecution it would undoubtedly have met the test
for disclosure to the defence ~ the possibility of a defect with

Horizon on Line was squarely raised in interview...

Of equal concern is the report compiled by Helen ROSE, dated the
12" Juné 2013 and dealing with her correspondence with Gareth
Jenkins in the Lepton SPSO 191 320 case (see also Spot Report #1).
Given what is said by Mr. Jenkins in dealing with Ms. Rose’s
questions concerning the ascribing of reversals in ARQ logs and their
use in court proceedings, this document too would have been

disclosable to the defence. .

. Customer support

Again the defendant raises firmly the inadequacy of the helpline and
the failure to respond to. her calls for help. The Second Sight Interim
report would have indubitably been disclosable had we been in

possession of it at the time.

Safety of Conviction

10. It is not the purpose of this review, nor of the review process overall, to
determine whether or not any particular conviction is unsafe: that decision is
reserved to the Court of Appeal only. The purpose of this process is to identify
those cases where the material contained within the Second Sight Interim
report would have met the test for disclosure as provided in the Criminal
Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, the Code of Practice enacted
thereunder and the Attorney-General’s Guidelines on Disclosure, had that
material been known to Post Office Ltd. during the currency of the
prosecution and accordingly would or ought to have been disclosed to the
defence.

11. In this case I have no doubt that, had we known of those matters identified in
the Second Sight Interim report, that material should and would have been
disclosed to the defence in accordance with our disclosure duties as
prosecutors. For that reason alone we must inform those who represented the
defendant and disclose to him both the Second Sight Interim report and the
Helen Rose 6" June 2013 report. ,

12. There is a possibility that, upon receipt of this material, the defendant will
seek the leave of the Court of Appeal to appeal his conviction. Where a
defendant seeks leave the Court of Appeal will, often before the grant of any

leave, invite the prosecution to comment upon the application.

13. I advise that, should we be so invited and/or should the defendant be granted
the requisite leave, we oppose his the grant of leave and any substantive
appeal, on the basis that the conviction may properly be regarded as safe for,
amongst other reasons, the following matters:

1. By her guilty plea she admits having committed the offence of
Fraud. I have no doubt that she would have been advised that:
1, By pleading guilty she was admitting guilt;

2. She should only enter a guilty plea if she were truly guilty;

POL00091783

POL-0091365
POL00091783
POL00091783

POL-0091365
3. She should not plead guilty if she was in fact not guilty;

4. She should not plead guilty solely or mainly in order to

achieve a lesser sentence in circumstances where she was

not guilty.

The defendant entered a basis of plea on the 23" of January 2012.

This basis, which must have been entered on instructions,

asserted:
i)

ii)

iii)

She took on a pasty and sandwich round business
which operated from November 2010. This
operated at a 75% loss.

She lost her own money in this business which had
been set up to offset the loss of business in the Post
Office Branch.

She “took money in the form of cash directly from
the Post Office safe to the overall value as outlined
in the prosecution case. This was at the rate of
about £1000 per week. This money went on basic
running costs for the pasty and sandwich franchise.

“T accept that I falsified the figures in the trading
accounts every month from the end of August 2010
by entering incorrect figures regarding the amount
of cash held in the safe over the relevant period.”

She has therefore admitted, by her basis of plea, the behaviour

alleged by the Crown in the amount alleged by the Crown. She

will have a deal of difficulty convincing The Court of Appeal that

this conviction is unsafe or that the sentence is manifestly

excessive. In my view she will have to change her representation

even to attempt it.

Conclusion
14. This is a case in which, had we been possessed of the material at the relevant
time, we should and would have disclosed to the defence the matters identified
in the Second Sight Interim report and the Helen Rose’s 6" June report.

15. Accordingly our duty is now to place the defence on notice of this fact and to
serve on them those documents. I advise that we comply with that duty in this
case.

16. Should the defendant be granted leave to appeal against his conviction, we

should oppose the appeal.

17. Subject to specific instructions to the contrary, I will draft a letter to the
defence for Post Office Ltd’s approval and, in accordance with your

instructions to us, serve that letter and the reports on defence solicitors.
