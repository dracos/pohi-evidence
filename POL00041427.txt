Subject: RE: Cuffley 193005 re Termination [BD-4A.FID26896945]

Rod

We agree that this doesn’t engage the Group Litigation Order.

Whilst it would fall within the scope of the Group Litigation as the matter concerns a termination due to alleged branch
shortfalls, the obligation to forward the matter to Freeths only arises where a letter of claim is received. At the moment Mr
Mirza has not sent a letter of claim, he is just requesting documents and information to challenge his termination.

The matter should therefore be dealt with as BAU. if you need any assistance with this through the ad hoc litigation file
then do let me know.

Kind regards,
Elisa

BD ~ I don’t think this engages the GOL, but could you please confirm one way or the other?

Paul - if we’re not required by the Group Litigation Order to forward this to Freeths, how would the business respond to
the request for info under BAU?

Subject: Cuffley 193005 re Termination
Jessica / Rod,

We'll need your help with this case please as there is an indication that it may be heading towards litigation. Key points
are:

- There was a bad audit with a significant loss identified. After the contracts advisor Carol Ballan had met with
who she thought was the Director of the Company, Mr Ednan Mirza, she found out that he had resigned as
Director in favour of his brother and sold his shares and the Company had been renamed.

-  EMis now the Co Secretary and remains a guarantor along with his estranged wife.

- Carol Ballan terminated the Company contract on 6 Feb 17 and the £58k debt remains unpaid.

- The security case continues and we are not aware of any decision on prosecution.

- Carol subsequently received the above letter and her reply is attached. She has now received another follow up
letter attached and would like advice on how to respond.

-  Itis very obvious from earlier dealings that these letters are not being drafted by Mr EM. We have maintained
the line of responding to the company at the registered address rather than him at the Cuffley address. Mr EM

was both present at the audit and asked to verify the audit findings. The audit report we have previously
supplied is the normal document produced by the NOA.

- Contractual matters are concluded apart from debt recovery at FSC and ideally we now want to be able to close
off any further correspondence.
