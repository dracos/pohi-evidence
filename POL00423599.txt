POL00423599
POL00423599

Despite a number of well publicised reports across organisations of a high level of Covid-related
reports since March 2020, only 3 Covid concerns were raised via Post Office whistleblowing
channels, which appears to indicate that the measures put in place and the information provided by

Post Office were robust:

e 43 whistleblowing reports were received (an increase of 5% on the previous year) and 51 cases

were closed (a number of cases closed were historic from 2019/20).

e¢ Compared to 2019/20, there was an increase in anonymous and employee reporting and a
reduction in Postmaster and member of the public reports.
e The majority of the allegations were about Postmasters (15 reports), closely followed by
employees (13 reports). Of the 15 Postmaster cases 4 were substantiated and 11

unsubstantiated.

e The majority of reports in 2020/21 related to Postmasters, with 73% being unsubstantiated. Of

the 4 substantiated reports:

o One related to allegations by a Postmaster assistant of mails fraud and resulted in the
termination of the Postmaster contract

o One related to an anonymous report relating to cash discrepancies. The Postmaster was
suspended and arranged to repay the monies owing.

o Two related to the sharing of SmartIDs (evidence of use of one Postmaster’s own ID when

he was out of the country and other Postmaster admitted sharing). Dealt with via Contracts

and regular ongoing oversight by Area Managers

¢ A further 8 cases were substantiated. These related to a number of issues:

o Employee posting inappropriate comments on social media
o. Theft by Postmaster assistant
o Non-conformance by employees with Post Office policy and procedures
o Employee SmartID mis-use
o Concerns about employees not following Covid-19 isolation requirements

« We have seen a decrease in the number of cases raised via the Speak Up line and an increase
in them coming directly to the Whistleblowing mailbox. However, year to date for 2021/22 we
have seen referrals from the Customer Support Team being the largest percentage of cases
(38% or 13 reports), driven by coaching and collaboration between the Whistleblowing and the
Customer Support teams.
