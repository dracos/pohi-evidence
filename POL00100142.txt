Hi Paula- just picking up on that part of Alice's question that relates to paying compensation, I think that it is fair to say
that we acted within our contractual powers previously (under the "old" policy), and that we will continue to act within
our contractual powers under the "new" policy. I think that any claim for compensation that is based on the notion that
once we have set a policy, then it must be fixed in stone for all time (as otherwise it is an admission of liability) is flawed,
and would arguably lead to very strange policy setting behaviour. It strikes me that it is also fair to say that our world has
changed a lot in the last few years, and one would therefore expect our policies to change as well......Chris

Paula,

There are still cases today that we precautionary suspend as detailed on the example page that you
have so not all of the 147 cases wouid fall into the no precautionary suspension category. Each case
would need to be assessed on the facts and to put this in to context we have 147 cases over a period of
13 years.

From reviewing the 147 cases there are a few that if we were dealing with that case today we would
probably have not precautionary suspended but for the majority these are probably at the other end of
the spectrum.

Hope this helps.

A question for tomorrow at Sam.

if we have changed our policies so dramatically on suspensions etc, isn't that an
admission that we got it wrong in the past and should therefore automatically pay
compensation to all affected?

Subject: Further briefing for tomorrow
Alice, Paula,

Please find attached is further briefing from Chris following a phone call from lan
Henderson.

Also attached a draft agenda that James has sent through after seeing ours, I suggest we
ask to take business improvement first at the start of the meeting as this sets the tone
for our wider engagement.

There are some further bullet points below setting out a proposed response to the past
cases issue:

e Cartwright King have reviewed past cases in line with a process that has been by
endorsed by leading Counsel.

e 325 individuals cases were reviewed to see if any issues arising out of the
Second Sight review ought to be disclosed to the defence in accordance with
our duties as a prosecutor.

e Further disclosure was provided in 21 cases.

e It is up to the defence in cases where disclosure has been provided to review
the material and take any appropriate action in the interests of their client.

e Thus far no convicted defendant has sought the leave of the Court of Appeal
to challenge his conviction; this may of course change.

¢ Post Office is still confident that we have not seen an unsafe conviction. We
continue to keep this matter under constant review as the Second Sight work
and Post Office's own investigations into the complaints continue.

e All 147 applications (including those with a criminal conviction) are being
overseen by a former Criminal Court of Appeal Judge Sir Anthony Hooper.
