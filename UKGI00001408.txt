Dear Minister

I have been contacted by Mrs Carol Riddell, of East Boldon Post Office, 93-95 Front Street,
East Boldon, NE36 OSA. Mrs Riddell is a sub-postmaster and runs East Boldon Post Office,
acting as an agent on behalf of Post Office Ltd. She informs me that she would like to raise
concerns of the difficulties faced by sub-postmasters such as the use of the computerised
accounting and electronic system called Horizon. Mrs Riddell informs me that the system is
difficult to use and over time she found discrepancies in her accounts that she was unable to
explain. Mrs Riddell has informed me that she suffered significant financial loss due to the
losses incurred using this system and was subsequently suspended from her contract) with
Post Office Limited. Mrs Riddell strongly maintains that it is not possible, when using the
Horizon system, to establish the reason for any discrepancy and believes the system maybe to
blame for the discrepancies that have occurred. I am informed by Mrs Riddell that although
she has since been reinstated by Post Office Limited she has had to dismiss two] staff
members, both of whom are close trusted family members. This situation has caused a great
deal of distress to Mrs Riddell and her family and Mrs Riddell informs me that she and other
sub-postmasters.are pursuing legal action against Post Office Limited for breach of contract.
Therefore, I would be grateful if you could look into Mrs Riddell’s concerns and let me know
your comments.

Stephen Hapburh MP —
