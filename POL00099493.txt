Janet I would suggest that you use the same forms as we are going to send to the JFSA, and to Shoesmiths which we can
send to you on Tues and you can forward to the MPs; you could also use the same form to send on to individuals who
may have contacted you directly. Going forward I think that new cases should be referred to the Alan Bates at the JFSA,
or alternatively you could email the pack.

With regard to the meeting in October, I think that Paula and James had briefly discussed this before the holidays so by
all means talk to James and perhaps it can be picked up as part of the meeting that Alice is having with him in early
September.

Thanks for your help

Thanks for the nudge, Susan.

Please find the list of new cases attached.

The level of information the spreadsheet contains fs poor, I’m afraid. In some cases, I have emails from the
relevant individuals (or their relatives) which I can send on to you — or someone, perhaps Tracy? — which offer
slightly greater detail, but none is in a state to send on to the investigators. Let me know if you want me to
send these emails on, and to whom.

Where no MP is listed, this is because I do not have the information required to indentify who the relevant MP
is.

Regarding getting in touch with each individual, because these have come in via email, what will work best is
if, in James’ absence, I write to each MP letting him or her know that the Post Office wishes to contact the

POL-0099076
POLO00099493
POL00099493

individual directly, and te pass on postal addresses to James’ office. I can then pass these details on to you.
Where we do not have identified MPs, I will email the relevant individual, requesting the same, and will pass
details on when I receive them.

If new cases arrive, where should I send details to, please?

Also, we did not cover what the October report ought to comprise when we met yesterday. I'd like to see what
James thinks, and then I'll report back. Would you be content with this?

Kind regards
Janet

Thanks

Thanks Susan,

Can you also — and in due course as I realize this isn’t going to happen immediately ~ let us know if you
decide to get in touch with Sir Stephen? And also if you don’t? James has jumped the gun rather, and if you
decide not to contact Sir Stephen, he will want to backtrack gracefully!

Kind regards

Dear Susan and Alwen,

James has come back to me with the following, which he kindly simply said pass straight on to you unedited.
“In the first document there is a "singed" rather than "signed".

In the second there is the following sentence: “If a solution cannot be reached directly between Post Office
and the Subpostmaster, both parties will then be invited to attend mediation." This implies a right to
mediation even if (as stated by the previous paragraph) the case review has determined the case is not

suitable for mediation. I personally would include after the words "both parties" the words "in a case found
suitable for mediation", but it's not a crucial point.

POL-0099076
POLO00099493
POL00099493

The third document begins "Thank you for your Application to the Initial Complaint Review and Mediation
Scheme. I am pleased to confirm that your Application has been accepted." It does not make clear what
"accepted" means. Accepted for what? Mediation? Consideration for suitability for mediation? Some over-
optimistic sub-postmaster might even take it as suggesting the points they have made in their application
letter have been agreed, and it needs to be made clear that is not what is intended.

Subject to those points, I am very happy with the way this is going, agree my quote (Susan / Alwen, see
below) and have spoken to Sir Stephen Sedley who might well be interested and would be a perfect chair
provided it did not take too much of his time. I haven't told him much in order not to compromise his

independence, so the Post Office would need to set out clearly what him. They need to
speak to his senior clerk, Glenn Hudson, in his chambers, Cloister:

The quotation you might consider dropping into the eventual announcement should read as follows, and I
would be very grateful to have sight of a draft copy prior to his eventual release.

‘James Arbuthnot said today, “I am very pleased indeed with the working group’s proposed process. To my
mind, it represents the very best chance all parties — individual SubPost Masters and Mistresses, and the Post
Office — have of ensuring the best outcome for everyone. It is fair, thorough, and independent.”

Many thanks, and I'll be in touch tomorrow with new cases list.

Janet
