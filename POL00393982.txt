1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 PURPOSE

The purpose of the Problem Management Operational Review Forum (PMORF) is to
review the performance of the problem management service, and consists of
representatives from the Problem Management units of PON Business Service
Management and ICL Pathway Customer Service.

1.2 SCOPE

The scope of Problem Management covers a variety of services within ICL Pathway
and PON. It is important that the PMORF does not duplicate work reviewed by
other Service Review groups. Inevitably there will be overlaps, so it is important
that each group informs others of any ‘linked’ discussions. For example, problems
will be discussed in other Operational Review Forums in which the problem pertains
to their particular area, for example, the Reference Data Operational Review Forum
will discuss Reference Data Problems. It is important that any issues with the
problems that are being dealt with are reported back to the Problem Management
Forum for review and action.

1.3. OBJECTIVES

The main areas PMORF will focus on are:

¢ Performance against the Interface Agreement [Ref.2];

¢ Performance of the cross-domain problem management operation/ process;

¢ Adherence of problem management to the cross-domain problem management
procedures;

¢ Quality of information being passed across the domains;

¢ Synchronisation of databases;

¢ Problem Management volumetrics;

¢ Types/categories of problems being raised.

2. POLICY
2.1 BUSINESS SERVICE MANAGEMENT

The Terms of Reference have been developed in line with the policy of the Service
Management Framework Service Review document [Ref.3.]. The SMF Service
Review document forms part of a group of documents that also include:

¢ Incident Management;

¢ Business Continuity Management;

e Change Management;

e Service and Performance Reporting.

It is important that members of Problem Management Forum and anyone involved
in related activities are conversant with the contents of the Framework documents.

3. MEETING PROCESS
3.1 ATTENDEES

The Problem Management Operational Review Forum will be chaired by the
representative of the PON Business Service Management team. The secretariat will
be provided by the hosting organisation.

Key attendees will be derived from:
« PON BSM Problem Management;
¢ ICL Pathway Customer Service Problem Management.

It is important that all representatives are suitably empowered to speak and act on
behalf of their respective domains. If an attendee can not attend a meeting, it is the
responsibility of the attendee to appoint a suitable substitute to take their place.

3.2 INPUTS

The following reports/inputs will be provided to the meeting:
¢ Problem Management Database reports;

¢ Service Improvement proposals;

¢ Issues raised to the forum from PON or ICL Pathway;

¢ Minutes and actions of the previous meeting.

3.3. MEETING AGENDA

3.3.1 Basic agenda

The basic structure for the Agenda will, on the whole remain constant. However,
attendees can request items to be added or removed from the Agenda as and when
appropriate.

3.3.2 Agenda distribution

Three working days prior to the meeting, the host organisation will distribute the
standard agenda, accompanied by a list of the problems and issues they wish to
table for discussion. * The other organisation will return their problems and issues
to enable visibility at least 3 working days prior to the meeting. All issues for
discussion which are not covered by the standard agenda will be addressed at the
meeting under ‘Any Other Business’.

* All problems raised should be in the agreed template format (see Appendix A).

3.5 FREQUENCY OF MEETINGS

The Problem Management Operational Review Forum will meet on a calendar
monthly basis. This will be timed to occur between ICL Pathway publishing the
latest performance reports and the Horizon Service Review Forum meeting, typically
the second week of the month.

3.6 ESCALATION AND REFERRAL

3.6.1 Escalation
Escalation should be considered to be an exceptional resort, and the reasons for
resorting to escalation should be examined for each occurrence. Escalation to a
higher level will normally occur either:
- When an issue is causing increased concern through time delay and
consequent business impact, or
- When it has not been possible to reach agreement on some aspect of the
definition or management of the issue.
Escalation from the PMORF will be to the HSRF.

3.6.2. Referral

The PMORF will refer issues that are outside its scope to the appropriate service
review forums.
