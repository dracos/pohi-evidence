Dear Angela,
Closure of the Post Office in Runnymede Avenue, Cleveleys, Lancs

Thank you for your letter dated 10% January, plus the.copy of the article you
referred to and which was posted the following day.

Whilst Julie Wolstenholme (subpostmistress of Runnymede Avenue) may
have voiced some personal opinions, there are wider personnel issues under
consideration, which I am not at liberty to divulge.

Post Office Counters Ltd is satisfied with the performance of the Horizon
platform, including the operation of OBCS within this environment. I am
sure that the Department has also seen the benefits of OBCS in the fraud

savings it is making and in the performance it is receiving from POCL.

There have been complimentary comments made by staff whom have
embraced automation, as well as some dissension with staff who have found
the transition challenging. However, we have found that once those who

“-have-had difficulties making the change have become reasonably proficient in
. using Horizon, views have changed. The Post Office publication Courier has

published comments from staff, from time to time, from’staff whom are now
using the Horizon platform, and I do recall that one specifically mentioned
how it had helped v with pension and allowance work. :

Our business is undergoing a major transformation, and inevitably there will
be some individuals who, for what ever reason, are resistant to or find it hard
to cope with change.

Yours sincerely
