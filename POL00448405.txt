Connecting Online & In Branch Experiences:

Bridging the Gap:

There are several things that the Post
Office do well from a customer
perspective.

The online experience is a great
example of what good looks like, but
then this is let down when “Online* is
translated to “In-Branch”.

Our aim is to co-create with the Post
Office an enhanced branch with
evolved touchpoints focused on
better serving the customers.

The 4 key areas of leverage that we

believe will best aid this evolution are:

- Queueing
- Signage

- Experience
- Service
