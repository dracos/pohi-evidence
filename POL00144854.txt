Dear Sir/Madam
Re Branch Discrepancies at Dundas Post Office

You may have been aware of 2 small value unexplained discrepancies
that have impacted your branch.

In light of these discrepancies Post Office has thoroughly investigated
your branch's records and, whilst undertaking this investigation, we have
ensured that any known discrepancies have not been charged to your
account. I write now to confirm the outcome of our investigations.

I can confirm that gains of £5.84 declared at TP9 in 2011/12 and 2012/13
were not proper to your branch. This issue was created by a specific set

of circumstances dating back to an actual gain you declared in 2010
(TP8).

In brief the stock unit that declared the discrepancy and placed it into
Local Suspense was deleted on or before 10" December 2010. A change
in archiving strategy meant did not account for this specific scenario.

The impact of this was that the loss of 2010 was picked up again at the
beginning of TP9 the next year in Horizon. At the end of TP9 the branch
was forced to clear this along with current discrepancies. The Local
Suspense ledger in the Post Office Finance System was impacted in the
same way.

This was scenario was then repeated at the same point the next year.
Both TP9 discrepancies recorded at your branch were of course assigned

to nominee and resolved under standard monthly settlement. Post Office
Ltd will not be looking to recover these gains.

You may not have been aware of these discrepancies but I felt it to be
important to make you aware of the issue.

Archiving rules have been amended to prevent a scenario of this type
repeating itself.

Yours sincerely
