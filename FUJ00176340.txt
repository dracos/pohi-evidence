Some transaction data is missing from PARC201 only. It is present on PARC202. Therefore we only have
one copy of the data. It is proposed to store the missing data on PARC201 too. It is proposed that the audit
servers have a generic share for storing data from ad hoc situations like this and a record of such occasions
is kept in DEV/INF/ION/0001.
