Dear Rodric,

Martin is at a funeral this afternoon. He asked me to forward these documents.

Also I spoke to a consultant about 15 mins ago who rang to run a position statement by us for the
board on Monday, relating to not commenting on turning points in criminal cases that have gone
to trial. Iam waiting to speak to Simon on the subject, but have yet to receive an email from the

consultant with her details to respond.

regards

Andrew Bole
