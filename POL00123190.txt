Craig,
Attached is the document Rob and myself have been working on with regards to how we decide the criteria for raising
investigation case-files in the ‘new-world’.

Obviously still in draft format and may be something to include in discussions when we next meet up?

Martin,

This is a revised version I previously sent you a couple of weeks ago and now includes a potential ‘scoring matrix’.
Your thoughts/comments welcomed.

Thanks,

Andy
