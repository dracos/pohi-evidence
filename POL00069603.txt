&
Tom Begzer and I had a telephone conversation with Mandy Talbot.

Tom explained that we wanted to catch up with her and keep her closely involved with this
case and strategy in view of developments over the last 36 hours.

I explained to Mandy that we had received a letter from BDO and they said that the
Accountancy Expert (not the IT Expert) would cost up to £62,000 plus VAT. We thought that
this was a significant amount and Mandy agreed. However we had always known that the
amount of costs involved in pursuing this case would way exceed the amount at stake.

Tom explaining that I had spoken with Counsel and we suggested the following strategy :-
1. I pick up the telephone to the other side’s solicitors. I explain to them that we had
looked at the manual reconciliation letter that they had sent to us in July and point out to
them the error that they had made i.e. they had compared the stock and cash for the wrong
week and assumed wrongly what had been brought forward.

2. We tell them what our expert cost is going to be and that we will look to recover that
from them - if the expert confirms what we think he will confirm.

3. We therefore invite them to disclose their Expert Report on a without prejudice basis, we
look at that and get our Expert to do a short response. We then have ADR and we arrange
to vacate the Trial date.

Mandy agreed that this was a sensible way forward and instructed me to make the telephone
call,

I will update her as and when I hear from the other side.
