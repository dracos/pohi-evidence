Problem Number : 10000073 - Volume of Non-Polled Office

Current incident levels are as follows at the end of July: 64 in total, with a breakdown as follows:

Day1 :27
Day 23:17
Day 4+ :20

One outlet (160 313) is at 8 days; this was reported in ICLP’s report of 28/07/00 as resolved. This outlet was reported as
resolved because ICLP’s health check shows that communication with the counter can be made, although a configuration
problem means that the counter is unable to communicate back. ICLP are hopeful that the problem should be resolved by
02/08/00 as it is a problem which has occurred before.

Root causes include =

* BT faults - The largest percentage of polling failures are caused by problems in the BT ISDN network .

« Problems cleared by gateway swaps and/or reboots.

* The majority of non poll failures are following a weekend - Analysis has failed to identify a trend on this although the
suspicion which cannot be proved are that some offices simply switch off their kit on a Saturday.

A clear statement of the solutions

Revised Incident Mgt Process introduced by ICL Pathway - the overall incident management process was reviewed and
tightened to ensure that incidents are handied quickly and directly

* BT faults. - Pathway are working with Energis in this area.

* Problems cleared by gateway swaps and/or reboots. - Analysi

Whilst these graphs show a far higher incidence of non-polling, on Monday , itis pleasing, to
note that the number of non-polled outlets has not grown in relation to rollout

NB. The 24'* July shows a high level of non polled offices. This was solely due to a
problem with the Pathway Correspondence server within that week. By Tuesday 25" July
non Polling had returned to normal levels.

Non - Conformance Issues

1. Girobank Postmaster’s Daily Records ( PDRs )

No information has been received from Girobank this month because of annual leave.
2.Non Polling

The action taken following the build up of a backlog of non polled offices after Easter and
the May Bank Holidays has resulted in more vigorous investigation of non polling incidents
by ICLP. However, despite the increase in resources devoted to the issue ICLP have not

been able to identify a significant level of non conformance.

Only two instances of non conformance, out of a total of 271 closed incidents, have been
identified on the new reports that ICLP have been producing, since 24 July.

The two postmasters concerned were contacted. One said his assistant had accidentally hit
the processor switch on her way out of the office. The other denied that the equipment had
been switched off. She said they had had a lot of problems with the system at the time and
that at one point they had been instructed to reboot all their terminals.

Although ICLP only contact offices after they fail to poll for two consecutive days they do
additionally contact those that fail more than once in a seven day period. This, together
with the fact that offices where the equipment is deliberately switched off at the weekend
would not be polled for two days, means that postmasters who deliberately switch off their
processor should be identifiable.

3. Passwords

The number of requests for One Shot Passwords has fallen by 40% (6% due to less requests
from auditors ), to a full network equivalent of 180 per week, since last month.

The number of calls related to non conformance has fallen in line with the overall fall in the
number of requests. However, there has been no improvement in our ability to identify the
reasons for requests - 45% of calls can not be categorised with confidence.

- First tranche of staff in post to cope with the increased number of errors from Horizon offices. These staff were allocated to individual teams for clearing the
increases up to May 2000

-Although recent weeks have produced a high number of errors for Horizon and manual offices and the length of the learning curve has increased, the latest forec:
of extra staff numbers are now inline with the original forecast by applying the improved average error clearance rates achieved in TP over the last 6 months.

- First staff being picked up now / June onwards from the external recruitment exercise for additional people and where replacements required

- This is a revised learning curve based on errors produced in the last 15 weeks at Horizon offices. The height of this curve is not as severe during the early stages after
‘conversion as that previously used. Errors produced per office in the 1st weeks after conversion, based on the last offices to go live, are shown in the table below.

- The length of the current learning curve is at least 20 to 30 weeks. The mid period figures (weeks 7 to 15) and the tail of the learning curve (over 20 weeks after conversion)

remain well above the baseline

- From the limited information available for converted offices at the moment, the learning curve is assumed to return to the manual baseline after 30 weeks.

Comments

The main cause of the problem is that many tables on the Cash Account are not mandatory for completion and some postmasters are realising

this once the account has been printed, thus the information has not been captured.

Impact

m Extra resource needed to input data into the system.
& Client Information distorted if not completed.
& Postmasters pay impacted - knock on effect could be more challenges on remuneration to TP

Recent figures show a considerable improvement over earlier months.

The sample size for time to prepare a cash account is too low for NRO2 and so
this has not been included.

The outlet coping, curves show that offices are now ‘coping’ at a similar level
to NRO and NRO1, and better than the live trial offices.

Mystery Shopper - June 2000

The mystery shopper survey has been used to look at the effect of installing,
Horizon on:

© quality of service;
* product knowledge;
© customer service indicator (conformance to standards).

Four groups of offices have been identified in order to look at the effect of
installing Horizon, and to look at whether this effect changes over time.
These groups are:

offices without Horizon;

live trial offices (LT);

national rollout offices before Christmas (NRO);
national rollout offices after Christmas (NRO1).

Only data from June has been analysed in this report, therefore NRO 1 offices
have been rolled out for and average of sixty nine days.

The main point to be noticed in this chart is the fact that overall number of
customers queuing for more than five minutes, is lower in the offices with
Horizon than those without. In the case of the Franchise and Modified
offices, which were rolled out in the Live Trial, no customers were waiting for
over five minutes during the mystery shopper vis
Analysis of the average waiting times of customers shows that overall the
longest queues are in offices which have been rolled out since Christmas 1999.
This is then followed by the offices without Horizon. This suggests that when

The graph above shows that the level of Sub Postmaster resignations has
remained relatively stable despite the continuing rollout of Horizon. At the
beginning of September 1999 there were only 323 offices on Horizon by May
1999 this figure had risen to 7000 offices yet there does not appear to be any
sharp increases in the levels of Sub Postmaster resignations. While some Sub
Postmasters have stated the introduction of Horizon as reason for their
resignation ; it appears that overall levels of resignations are not out of the
ordinary.

levelling off around 1.5 calls per office per week. (The troughs in the graph 17-23 April & 29 May - 4 June are caused by Bank Holidays

when a lower number of calls were received).

The level of calls to Regional helplines has continued to fall as offices become automated and therefore phone the NBSC instead of their
regional helplines. Total calls over the last month have however remained fairly static despite the migration of some 300 outlets a week .
The average level of calls to the Regional Helpdesk is around 1.5 calls per office per week. This is comparable to the average calls to the

The pie chart shows that there has been an increase in percentage of client counter

procedure calls and a reduction in the percentage of horizon calls when compared to the
year to date totals. This is probably due to the fact that a some of the old horizon calls were
not proper to NBSC and should have gone to the Horizon System Helpdesk. The reduction
in the percentage of Horizon calls received would indicate that this problem has been

reduced.

The graph shows that the main area for concern is the rising number of people who had
increasing difficulty during April and May. The reason for the increase in people failing to
get through to HSH was due to the surge in calls at the end of April and beginning of May
regarding revaluation. This issue had been resolved by June hence the fall in complaints in
this category. The introduction of IVR (Interactive Voice Recognition) by HSH at the
beginning of June may also have helped to reduce complaints in this category.

Traffic Light System

Each CSF has at least one measure attached to it. These are shown in
blocks and each block of measures are weighted at 100%. If all are
equally important in the block the 100% is divided across the block of
measures. This system works well in areas like OSG where there are
distinct differences in the importance of each measure. The traffic lights
are then used to show the total of the weighting. For example if a CSF
has a number of low graded measures on red but the higher ones are all
on green this suggests that there are no major issues affecting the CSF
and therefore the overall traffic light for that CSF would be green.
However in Transaction Processing all the CSF’s are equally important
which means that if any of the measures are adversely affected the
impact is high on TP.
