The target date for Live for the Oracle fix for the LCK problem is 25" April. We have considered an option to
bring this LCK fix into Live on Thursday evening and believe this is possible:
FUJ00095350
FUJ00095350

1. Just before the ref data refresh at 00:00 i.e. between 22:30 and 00:00

e We made a similar change @ this time on a previous occasion with the important task being to
restart the BAL's to ensure they are all connected after the work.

e If the system is available at 22:30, the team is comfortable with the timescales for application of the
fix to the BDB and possible regression before 23:45.

2. Just after the ref data refresh at 00:30

+ This is slightly different and hasn't been done before but there should be no major differences between
this and 1) apart from slightly different TWS schedule considerations

+ If, for some unknown reason, we had to wait later than 22:30, we can easily adapt the second strategy
of running it in after 00:30 as the schedule changes are very similar

My view would be to proceed with number 1 above but if the early evening schedule runs late, we have the
fallback to number 2.

If it goes on to LST with no issues, we'd be comfortable running it in to Live during either of these periods on Thursday
night, we'll also verify the 30 minutes for the BDB fix on LST.

Following successful application of the LCK fix on Thursday evening, we’d like to agree a Friday afternoon
slot to switch Streams on to test the LCK problem in Live.

In addition to the above changes and fixes, we are also working on other options to address current
behaviours on the system, some of these fixes may come through test on time for a Sunday morning upgrade
or later next week as OCP’s.

I would like to discuss this by conf call, probably tomorrow morning,

Regards Vince
