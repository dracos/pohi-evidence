PC0121131 - Item IDs will
become 5 digits

25/05/05: With Des-Auth (Chris Bailey) — May be an
issue for $90. If so counter regression tests needed.
26/05/05: Design should cope with 5 digits but at least
I place wont cope (PLU look ups) — Where can this be
tested? When is it likely to be a problem?

27/05/05: To be discussed

01/06/05: long term item - on hold pending discussion.
10/06/05: remains on hold.

01/07/05: Call will be addressed, but its priority is
ranked 3rd after 050512_2 above and 050607_11
below.

04/07/05: Example code confirming this problem exists
has been found in EPOSS code. Extent not yet known.
Monitoring by CS suggests drop-dead date for fix
delivery is not later than 11/2006.

07/07/05: re-evaluation by CS now puts the date at
08/2006.

11/07/05: Chris Bailey to be asked to start
investigations

12/07/08: ChrisB has gone as far as poss without Dev
help. Further investigation needed, but should probably
be CP'd before any corrective action is implemented.
18/07/05; No Change (Awaits Resource possibly
available w/e 22/07))

Clone of PC0122270 (see Move to

to apply the Solaris patches.

28/06/05: Need to dovetail with V&I plan — to be

30/06/05: CS produce a risk list of all activities to be
accomplished on w/e 16/17-07.

04/07/05: Further concern expressed in development.
RC to get Andy Gibson to Prayers tomorrow morning.
05/07/05: ISD not available to prayers. On-Going
06/07/05: need to understand: how best to test host code
against Solaris patches; when to introduce Solaris
patches to which rigs; the full set of dependencies if
this causes slip; the extent of any slip: before sharing
this problem with POL. DH to initiate desk check of
Host code. RC initially to take lead in collecting
information. BR to lead on discussions with POL when
information collected and understood.

07/07/05: host code desk check started. Likely task
completion 12/07/05. Draft plan produced by Peter
Goodwin to be circulated to Prayers attendees by PD.
Alternative strategies still being invesigated.

BR to discuss possibiity of reduced Solaris Patch set
with EMC and Bring GJ & PJ up to speed.

08/07/05: Desk check ongoing. BR has made POL
aware of probable slip. EMC not yet contacted.

GJ to invite NiallF and or SimonF to get involved and
if possible take ownership.

11/07/05: Desk Check has shown potential problems in
various d/bases, Of concern is TES and LFS.

CS asked for impact on SLAs etc

DH to provide areas for test concentration. Desk
checking to continue apart from those people working
on APOP. PMU: BTCI had fixes in place

12/07/05: Desk Check continuing.

Search for problem causing patches continuing.
Consider effect of patch removal on EMC tests already
carried out.

13/07/05: Solaris patch problem now being progressed
by separate forum (Chaired by NialF?). This action to
be held open at least until solution identified.
Significant progress by the separate forum to be
reported to prayers.

14/07/05: Fix for Peak delivered in WP22405, tested &
delivered to live. Solaris Patch problem on-going.
15/07/05: Desk check complete. Some testing of "at
risk" areas performed by ITU. Design team not
convinced the depth & breadth of testing done in the
time available is enough to give confidence. EMC
position is no support without full Solaris patch set.
GJ to take forward at programme level on 18/07.
18/07/05; GJ taking forward today. DH & SB
discussing options for Cycle 5.
