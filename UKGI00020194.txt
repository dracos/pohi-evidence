Think Patrick overworrying, probably because he is less sighted than he wants to be!

Good to know. I discussed with Andrew that there will be a limit to what Tim will be able to do in the time. Wondering if
we can get to the point where in April Tim offers to write to JA with a publicly-suitable update at the appropriate time -
or even offers to meet? Patrick may not like the idea of putting pen to paper publicly but they will have to say something
at some point

Tim quite relaxed about meeting BNR. Would rather it be towards the end April if possible as hard to speed up process
(Deloitte got lot of work to do, one of the qc's has a big case that doesn't end to next month). But his view is we'll be
where we will be.

Hi Laura

I have just had word that BNR’s PS had asked for a meeting with Tim in April, with the specific ask that he take her
through the ‘detail’ of the horizon testing, so that she is in a position to brief Lord Arbuthnot when she meets with him
at the end of that month.

That’s rather unexpected and raises a number of issues, including the fact that the work being done is in the nature of
confidential legal advice to Tim.

We were due to speak once the Board meeting has taken place in any event — can we add this development to that
conversation ?

’'m copying Jane MacLeod, who is on leave in Australia, for information since I think she ought to be sighted on this.
Many thanks

Patrick
