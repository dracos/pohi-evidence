Transaction Acknowledgements (TAs)

What is a Transaction Acknowledgement?

Transaction Acknowledgements (TAs} are an
automated way to account for transactions carried out
‘on the Paystation or Camelot Lottery terminals each
day.

Transaction Acknowledgements are sent electronically
overnight and are processed by the first person who
logs into Horizon Online after it has been sent.

A pop up message appears on Horizon and you won't
be able to serve until the outstanding Transaction
Acknowledgements has been processed.

You need to:

+ Check the cash received for your Paystation
and Lottery transactions against the list of
outstanding Transaction Acknowledgements

+ ‘Process TAs’ to accept all entries on the screen

+ Physically move the cash in or out of the stock
unit where the Transaction Acknowledgements
were accepted. This ensures that your stock
unit will balance

Viewing accepted Transaction
Acknowledgements

There may be occasions where an assistant needs to
serve customers quickly, so they process the
Transaction Acknowledgements without checking or
physically moving the cash in or out of the relevant
stock unit

‘On those occasions, you can print a report to show
what was accepted, on Horizon go to:

+ "Back Office’ then ‘Reporting’. then ‘Reporting
Office’. then ‘Outstanding and Processed’

+ Enter dates from (yesterday) and to (today}

This report prints on the back office printer, so
remember to switch it on.
