The recusal issue [confidential] (if there is in fact one) is to be dealt with "in house" at One Essex Court. The wider

appeal issue remains a live topic but is on a longer time frame.

As matters firm up around the wider appeal I may be in touch but POL recognises MHQC may get 'booked! in

between.

I hope to be in touch going forwards but just thought I'd drop you a line now to say the urgent element is being dealt

with at OEC.

Many thanks

Tom,

I’ve spoken with Mark and he would in principle be happy to assist going forward.

Mark has several smaller hearings in the run up to a 6-7 week arbitration commencing the last week of May
so he has good availability over the coming months to advise and draft as required.

As things stand, Mark would then be looking from January 2020 to accommodate a hearing in the Court of
Appeal.

I hope that this assists and look forward to hearing from you in due course.

All the best,

Luke

Today is the last day of an Arbitration that he is attending so I’ll speak to him when he returns this evening.

Just touching base to see if any clarity re MH QC availability in (say) next two months if appeal/recusal application(s)
needed.

Look forward to hearing.
