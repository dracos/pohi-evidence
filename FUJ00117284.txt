Currently we have a red for the period Jan-Mar due to the 3 month induction windows incomplete for February and March. We have
Ja 100% conformance for January. We cancelled the induction for March due to end of year commitments hence the reason none of
the March joiners have attended. As those who Joined in February still have the April induction to attend and those who joined in
March can still attend in April and May this is not an issue and the expectation Is that when the 3 month induction period Is over for
the March joiners, this will be green.
