OPERATIONAL SERVICE MANAGEMENT

1. Introduction

This report is produced by the PDA Operational Service Management team and
provides a high level “in-flight” assessment of any threats to overall Business .
Continuity in the Congo 4 live service environment. The primary purpose is to
identify any issues (actual or potential) that might give rise to considering a
suspension of the Congo 4 roll-out or regression from ICL Pathway services.

For ease of reference, the report utilises a traffic light system with the following
keys -

o

Immediate Threat to Business Continuity

Potential Threat to Business Continuity

No Threat to Business Continuity

NB Any comments about the content, format or value of the report
would be welcomed by the PDA Operational Service Management team
at Terminal House.

2. End to End Business Continuity

There are no matters that need escalating for consideration of suspending the Congo
4 roll-out and/or regressing from ICL Pathway services.

5.1 INFRASTRUCTURE

5.1.1 ICL Pathway are continuing their investigations and testing of the release 1c
printers, OSM are awaiting a further update.

5.2 BES

5.2.1 With reference to transactions being lost after printer failure. ICL Pathway have
investigated their system in a testing environment and have concluded that after the
user produces a manual receipt and ‘exits out’, the system returns back to the
transaction to be committed. However, OSM believe in the ‘live’ environment the
system actually return to the main menu and does not prompt the user to commit the
transaction. OSM will seek further clarification.

5.2.2 Incidents have arisen this week where payment cards have been incorrectly issued
to customers in five Post Offices in the NE Region, this has left the customers with
unactivated cards,

ICL Pathway, CAPS and OSM have contained the situation by identifying and
isolating the possible customers concerned (eleven ), and making arrangements for
new cards to be distributed to them.

OSM has produced and arranged distribution of a special notice to ALL 205 Post
Offices operating release Ic.

The CSU has made contact with the said customers, explaining the situation and the
impact on them.

OSM has logged the incidents on the problem management database with purpose
of identifying the route causes.

PAS
ICL Pathway are considering improvement opportunities to various aspect of the
Bath Road duplicate payment problem;

monitoring of communications with outlets;

PAS acceptance of duplicate transactions harvested on the same day;
inclusion of these in CBoS and the CPCS and ABED interfaces;
PAS validation to minimise file rejections by CPCS;

CMS

The PUNs for IGL card swap-out were scheduled for distribution in week
commencing Ist December and is expected to continue for the duration of
December.

The reason for'the IGL cards to be replaced are:-

. PAN checksum incorrect.

. Livery change on Card reverse ( Rollout Card is different from that for IGL)

° Word change on Card reverse ( Helpline telephone number, Freepost return
* address & referral contact for information about the benefit ).

To date there has not been any problems with the card replacement process, OSM
will obtain further update at the end of December 1997.

ABED

There has been no new problems to report this week. All outstanding conceins /
problems continue to be monitored and awaiting resolution via the problem

"management process.

Fraud and Security

Proposals for the authentication of users to the Payment Card has been submitted to
the parent organisations, however there was need for further clarification from ICL
Pathway.

7.1 Definitions for the purpose of this report.

A transaction is a broad description of a customer session.

A payment is the Child Benefit allowance money due for one weck, or for four weeks ( in case of
a four- weekly allowance).

Anencashment is a measure of the work effort in a customer session from the clerk accepting the
payment card to returning the card with monies, i.e. one customer is paid all due Child Benefit
allowance. Thus, a customer may save several payments before visiting their PO. During such a
transaction there will be one encashment of several payments.

APPENDIX ‘A’

EXTRACT FROM BA/POCL PDA RECONCILIATION - OPERATIONAL
REPORT _ 4

SUMMARY OF RECONCILIATION FOR THE PERIOD

IGL
Two IGL incidents were carried forward for which ICL Pathway provided credits on
its October invoice, These incidents were closed on 12 November.
Release 1c Statistics
There were 10 new reconciliation incidents representing nine cases - one was
prematurely cleared and a new incident raised when new evidence emerged. Eight
were cleared and two remain open, one related to a registered “Known Problem”.
* New Not Cleared*
Exception Type & Exception Number No. £s I No. I fs
Authorisation of a non-existent Payment (30) 3] 87.15 1} 29.05
Stop not confirmed to CPCS (“marooned”) (330) 1I 60.15 1] 60.15
Transaction data lost - BES time-out (465) 3] 81.35
Transaction data lost - counter printer failure (523) 2I 33.15
Transaction data lost - user set-up error (530) 1I 38.05
Totals [10 I 299.83 2{I 89.20

* Cleared = reconciliation work complete but not closed (perhaps any credits due not yet issued).
Not cleared = reconciliation work (including data and financial resolution) not complete.

General Reconciliation Performance

General reconciliation performance was good. In particular, recovery of lost
transaction data was prompt and effective.

Improvements F
Improvements are being made to reconciliation processes:
. all parties now get notification of all incidents and a weekly summary;
. forms and reports are being revised to improve text and cross references;
. original encashment id to be recorded for lost transaction data recovery;
¢ "inks to associated “software” incidents for BA COPS are under discussion.

Concerns

The duplicate payment on 17 November in Bath Road Post Office included a series
of compound errors and is a “Problem”. Resolution of the reconciliation and data
aspects is decided but not yet complete.

A software fix is scheduled for next month to clear and prevent “marooned stops”.

OPERATIONAL SERVICE MANAGEMENT

A system fault at the Payment Card Helpline caused a duplicate encashment that
was compounded by a failure. This caused loss of transaction data that was
recovered,

aba

Incidence of transaction data loss is much higher than forecast for the 10 active post
offices. Recovery has worked well, but there is a need to review causes.

The overall exception rate (1 per 310 encashments) is a concern if’ scaled up to full
Release 1c volumes (factor 25) and an issue if scaled to full roll-out (factor
thousands).
