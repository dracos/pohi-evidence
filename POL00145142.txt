RE: Horizon Letters - Strictly Private & Confidential - Subject to Privilege - Do Not Forward

the updated Timeline info at Point 2 change your advice at all plse?

as though we may have only been able to view it as a repeating problem in Feb 2013 when we
to see it happened for a second time (does that make a difference? — see question 1 below)

e — It also looks like we then ask FJ to investigate in Feb 2013

SO my questions are:
1. Do you still have to I
2. Does it mean the on!

look back to cases since it first happened in Jan 2012 (we will want you to anyway)
ly GJ statements that might give concern are ones since Feb 2013?

Susan and I have to brief the CEO at 9.45

Letters - Strictly Private & Confidential - Subject to Privilege - Do Not Forward

Two issues following on from our conference today:
POL00145142
POL00145142

1. the letters to branches regarding the 14 Branch Anomaly (“B14”) and its impact on the (purported)
prosecution of an assistant at a “Costcutter” branch; and
2. the timing of when B14 came to the attention of Post Office Limited and Fujitsu

1. Letters to Branches

I attach the letters we propose sending to the branches affected by B14. The “Merthyr Dyfan” letter concerns the
Costcutter branch which might have involved a Police prosecution of a branch assistant. Unfortunately, we are still no
clearer on the status of this investigation/prosecution.

During our con, you recommended sending information concerning B14 to defense counsel (assuming there is one).
Please provide us with a draft letter for this purpose and an indication of the information which should be supplied
with it. In case it assists, I attach the initial report Gareth Jenkins produced on B14 (the version I received was dated
10 May 2013, but I see from the attachment that it uses an auto-date).

During our con, you explained prosecuting counsel’s duty of disclosure. Please also let us know whether we could
satisfy our duty of disclosure (i.e, that we know of an issue which might be relevant to criminal proceedings) by
notifying the Police/Costcutter prosecuting counsel of B14 so that they can take a view on whether they should
disclose it to the defense in accordance their duty.

2. B14 Timing

Issue first surfaced at POL Finance Service Centre (FSC) on 6 February 2012, at the close of a Branch Trading
period

* Issue concerned the £9799.88 discrepancy at Willen branch

© FSC might have proactively contacted SPM given the size of the discrepancy

© FSC investigated, saw that it looked wrong, and brought the account back to balance (i.e. £0) at no cost to the
SPMR

* FSC would have monitored the Willen branch to see what happened the following month

© Over the next few weeks, as the rest of the Branch Trading data for the same period was processed, the other
13 branch anomalies were noted

* Those other branches’ accounts were brought to balance, again at no cost to the subpostmaster

© This was not perceived to be a significant issue given the small number of branches affected and the small
sums involved

© On 6 February 2013, the Willen SPMR contacted POL National Business Support Centre (NBSC) to report the
same discrepancy in his Branch Trading as the previous year

* NBSC passed this on to Fujitsu between 6 and 8 February 2013

© Fujitsu then notified FSC of the problem on 28 February 2013

* Fujitsu resolved B14 on 25 April 2013

Does any of this change the advice given at the con?
Please let me know if you wish to discuss.

Kind regards, Rodric

Thanks all.

Andy Winn — can you please confirm that letters in the zip file are those emailed by Andy Parsons at 1432, plus the
one for Merthyr Dyfdd.

I need to check the position on the Merthyr Dyffd one because of a criminal prosecution taken against a staff member
of that branch, before sending them all to Lesley Sewell and Alwen Lyons for approval.

Thanks, Rodric

Hi Andy

Amended versions.

On Rosyth Terminus I’ve altered the end of the 5" para “Errors made by yourself” as Alan does not work in branches.
The same would be said of all the letters going to a head office rather than a branch. In the scheme of things not a big
issue.

Rodric, Rod
Please find attached the 10 letters to SPMRs for your review.

I've based these on the template letter however each has needed to be customised depending on each branch's
specific circumstances. My amendments are as follows:

e Amendments in W are where there is a variable in the template that needs to be changed in each letter
and I have updat le variable.

e Track change amendments are where I have changed/deleted sections of the template letter to meet specific
circumstances.

In general, my amendments have been to:
POL00145142
POL00145142

e Adjust for whether a branch suffered a gain or a loss.

¢ — Adjust the loss/gain figures.

e Adjust the final paragraph as to how the gains/losses will be settled (this depends on whether there is a loss /
gain and whether there is a SPMR or multiple branches)

e Adjust dates to reflect trading periods. For example, I believe that a loss incurred in TP10 will actually be in
January. Hence the date of the loss needs to be 2012 rather than 2011 or 2013 rather than 2012.

I've taken my information from the original letters produced by Andy Winn.
I've inserted the address for WHSmith and updated the "typo" to refer to 14 branches rather than 5 SPMRs.

There is only one letter where the SPMR knew of this issue (Willen). However, I had understood that POL had
received two complaints. Was this second complaint from a Crown branch?

I'll be on my direct dial below for the next 30 mins and then on the BB if you need me.

Kind regards
Andy

Can you please produce the individual letters to the branches based on this template, then email them all back to me

Thanks for your assistance.

Subject: Horizon Letters - Strictly Private & Confidential - Subject to Privilege - Do Not Forward

Hi, further to my conversations with Joanna in Communications and with Rodric in Legal I attach the latest redrafted
letter. Suggested actions:

1. Simon / Lesley — consideration of whether need to run the letter past Fujitsu

2. To consider briefing NFSP (George and Marilyn)

3. Rodric to liaise with Bond Dickinson as per the remainder of my note below
I have made one change from the v2 version which I sent round at 17:22 on Friday. That change is to expand the

introductory section for branches who have not previously had any communication about this issue. This is the bit in
smaller font at the start of the letter

Rodric has advised that Bond Dickinson are on standby to populate individual tailored letters from a master template.
The plan is therefore that Bond Dickinson will produce the 10 individual letters as variants to the attached example.
These should then be recirculated with myself and Andy as prime sign offs in terms of checking that the variants do

properly reflect the chain of events. We appreciate that this is not a straightforward situation.

I think there are a number of paragraphs requiring tailoring of wording or values or dates etc. These should include
the following areas:

Has there already been comms with this branch about it?
Gain or loss?

Does a previous branch owner need mentioning?

Is it right to refer to TP9 only?

Was the loss / gain made good locally or settled centrally?

If settled centrally, was it blocked or was payment made?
POL00145142
POL00145142

Are there other losses & gains to refer to?

How will it be resolved (pay run, or something else)
In terms of addressees, we believe that the addressees on the original draft of 10 letters produced by Andy are right
to use. The addressees are either the current subpostmaster or the nominee / multiple retailer head office contact

for branches which are owned by multiple partners.

There is one branch under separate review where a different agent was in tenure at the time when the original loss or
gain arose in the first place in 2010 (Bowness 266418)

The one missing address in the earlier 10 drafts was WHS (for the Houndslow branch). We will send that on shortly.

Thanks, Rod
