Susan: I have today received permission from Mr Rudkin to release to POL a copy of his affidavit. Hereitis. Might!
suggest that we keep it on a limited circulation, not least because it contains many unproven but nonetheless potentially
damaging assertions. I think it would help if Simon, Alwen and Angela were to see it. The section dealing with the
Bracknell matter (paragraphs 47 - 60 ) has highlighted a couple of small errors in our draft Spot Review (SROOS) so I have
corrected it and attach the new version of it here.

lll be happy to discuss and will separately send Simon a copy of SROO5 but leave it to you to control the handling of the
affidavit.

Best regards, Ron.
