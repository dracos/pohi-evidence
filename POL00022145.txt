Attachments: FW: Second Sight Engagement Letter; Second Sight Part Two report

Jonathan,
We have not yet received Second Sight’s “Part Two” report, but will forward this to you as soon as it comes in.

I do however attach an email containing a pdf of the first draft of this report, Section 2 of which sets out SS’s
“commentary” (for want of a better word) on the standard subpostmaster contract.

As we discussed yesterday, could you please help us prepare a form of challenge to SS’s commentary on Section 2,
which ideally would compel SS to either remove or neutralise that section from the Report, or failing that, provide a
response to the commentary which could be read alongside it.

In case it assists, I also attach an email with the Engagement Letter we have with SS. Para 5.1 of the Schedule may
provide a bit of a hook —if SS are required to “act with the skill and care expected of qualified and experienced

accountants”, to me that means they have agreed not to stray into other areas of expertise, e.g. contract law.

With thanks for your assistance,
Rodric
