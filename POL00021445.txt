7. EXTERNAL AUDIT I

Irrelevant I

ovided an update on the audit work relating to the postmast
Horizon. PM explained that he had met with JM and AC to discuss the status of the
court proceedings. PM was also due to meet with JM and Andrew Parsons (Womble
Bond Dickinson) in late April to receive a further update and review the need for a
disclosure note. PM explained that to date, the claimants’ had not indicated the
amount of damages being sought and a formal state of claim was awaited. If a
statement of claim was received prior to the signing of the annual report and
accounts for the year ended March 2018, the Company would be required to
disclose the figure as a contingent liability. This disclosure would be accompanied
by a narrative to be drafted by JM and Womble Bond Dickinson for agreement by
the Company. PM clarified that the figure disclosed would not need to be provided
for because the Company would be making clear its intention to defend the matter.
The Committee understood that EY would also assess whether the statement of
claim affected its audit opinion and would prepare an emphasis of matter
referencing the contingent liability. At present, the amount of damages sought was
unquantified and PM would monitor the situation. JM added that there was a }
possibility that no indication of damages would be given until the forthcoming court
hearings had considered the construction of the contract and the operation of
Horizon.

DG and CR joined the meeting.
