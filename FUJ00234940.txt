6.1.3 1 Tech Lead;

6.1.4 2 Test Analysts; and

6.1.5 1 Business Analyst,

each of which shall have the responsibilities set out within Appendix 3 (Participants).

The parties acknowledge and agree the benefit of standardisation and consistency in
the structure and delivery of the Digital Development Services. However, during the
Product Initiation phase or at any other time agreed by the Digital Demand
Forecasting Board (on at least 90 days’ prior notice), if, despite having acted
reasonably to seek to use the Standard Sprint Team Structure and standard size of
Sprint Team, Post Office and Fujitsu Services are unable to make use of such
Standard Sprint Team Structure, Post Office and Fujitsu Services may agree (or, in
exceptional circumstances only, where the Standard Sprint Team Structure and
standard size of Sprint Team cannot accommodate the Sprints intended for a Sprint
Team, Post Office may require):

6.2.1 analternative structure for a Sprint Team for a given Product that differs from
the Standard Sprint Team Structure in which case the parties will agree upon
the allocated roles to be contained within that alternative or smaller Sprint
Team and consider any applicable necessary changes to the Per Sprint
Story Point Allocation accordingly, taking into consideration the composition
of the Sprint Team and increased (for example, due to improved
communication as a result of a smaller team) or decreased (for example, a
larger percentage of a smaller team providing management, rather than
development, functions) efficiencies introduced through the size of Sprint
Team;

6.2.2 an alternative, smaller size for a Sprint Team, in which case the parties will
agree upon the allocated roles to be contained within that alternative or
smaller Sprint Team and consider any applicable necessary changes to the
Per Sprint Story Point Allocation accordingly; or

6.2.3 to fill a Fujitsu Services appointed role in the given Sprint Team with a Post
Office individual (provided that the ScrumMaster and Tech Lead shall always
be filled by Fujitsu Services).

For clarity, the day to day management of the Sprint Team resides with Fujitsu
Services and Post Office shall ensure that any of the Sprint Participants who are Post
Office roles agree to accept management and direction by Fujitsu Services.

For each Sprint, Fujitsu Services shall ensure that the Fujitsu Services appointed
roles in the Standard Sprint Team Structure are filled by effectively trained individuals
with the abilities, qualifications and experience necessary to meet the Sprint
Requirements. The parties acknowledge the continuity benefit of retaining the same
individuals in the appointed roles and therefore any changes will need to be managed
to minimise Sprint disruption. In particular, Fujitsu Services shall not change any

individual in the Fujitsu Services appointed roles without a valid, justifiable reason for
doing so, which it shall provide to Post Office in advance of the individual being
changed. Where the Sprint Requirements for a Sprint require particular skillsets,
Fujitsu Services may, in consultation with the Product Owner, vary the individuals in
the Fujitsu Services appointed roles for that Sprint in order to match such skillsets.

DEMAND FORECASTING
The Digital Demand Forecasting Board

Post Office shall be responsible for arranging and managing the Digital Demand
Forecasting Board which shall meet every 12 weeks during the DDS Term, and as
otherwise required. The Digital Demand Forecasting Board shall work with the Post
Office’s portfolio management processes to understand, assess and manage the
overall Demand Forecast. Should the Digital Demand Forecasting Board fail to meet
as scheduled, Fujitsu Services shall escalate the same to Post Office’s Group ClO
as a priority and the Digital Demand Forecasting Board shall urgently meet within 5
business days of such escalation.

The Digital Demand Forecasting Board shall be responsible for:

7.2.1 reviewing and registering new Products on the Demand Forecast by
assessing whether there is available capacity for these within the current
resources involved in the provision of DDS (as set out in Appendix 3);

7.2.2 agreeing the Sprint Team requirements and associated increase or
decrease in other resources as appropriate on a 90 day ordering block as
more fully described in Appendix 5;

7.2.3 shifting available capacity from one Product to another Product as forecast
demand flexes (including where Post Office requires urgent works on a
Product or otherwise wishes to prioritise or expedite a Product); and

7.2.4 allocating Sprint Teams to Product Owners and Product Delivery Managers/

The commercial mechanisms for ordering additional capacity or reducing a previous
commitment are set out in Appendix 5 to this Schedule 13.

The provisional attendees to the Digital Demand Forecasting Board are set out in
Appendix 4 (Governance).

PRODUCT INITIATION

Once the Product Vision and Business Case have been produced by the relevant
Product Sponsor and approved internally by Post Office, then where Post Office
requires Fujitsu Services to commence the delivery of the relevant Product it shall
commence Product Initiation. Product Initiation utilises the Product Vision and
Business Case to deliver the pre-requisites and dependencies that are necessary
before development work can commence.

As part of Product Initiation, Fujitsu Services, with Post Office input, shall produce the
following key deliverables:

at this stage);

(c) a Release and Test Strategy for the Product which itself has been
prepared by the Post Office; and

(d) the Service Requirements for supporting the Product once live; and
8.2.2 an initial Product Backlog.

In order to support Post Office to complete the Product Roadmap for the Product,
Fujitsu Services will perform the following activities:

8.3.1 provide support and expertise to the Product Owner to enable effective
planning;

8.3.2 analyse User Stories to provide advice on dependencies and pre-requisites
so that User Stories in the Product Backlog can be correctly prioritised and
sequenced;

8.3.3 provide advice on the size and complexity of each User Story to enable items
in the Product Backlog to be scheduled into available Sprints;

8.3.4 provide input to enable Product Backlog items to be identified as Planned
User Stories and/or Stretch User Stories; and

8.3.5 feed into the Digital Demand Forecasting board as necessary.

AGILE METHODOLOGY

Each party shall act in accordance with the provisions of Appendix 1 (Agile
Methodology).

PERFORMANCE METRICS

The parties shall comply with the terms of Appendix 4 (Governance) and Appendix 8
(Service Credit Mechanism).

RELIEF EVENTS AND DISRUPTED SPRINTS

To the extent that Fujitsu Services becomes aware that it may be unable to complete
a Sprint Requirement as the result of the occurrence of a Relief Event, Fujitsu shall:

11.1.1 notify Post Office as soon as reasonably possible and at the next Daily
Stand-up; and

11.1.2 use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate the Relief Event (which may
include working on alternative User Stories within the Sprint Backlog).

11.2 Where Fujitsu Services is not able to sufficiently mitigate the Relief Event, the
affected Sprint Requirement(s) shall be removed from the relevant Sprint and the
matter shall be escalated to the ScrumMaster and Product Owner, who shall refer the
matter (with their recommendations) to the Delivery Lead and Product Delivery
Manager for resolution. The parties will agree the impact of the Relief Event on the
affected Sprint Requirement(s) upon the Sprint (including with regard to Appendix 8
(Service Credit Mechanism)).

11.3 Fujitsu Services shall not be liable for failing to complete a Sprint Requirement that
has been removed from a Sprint pursuant to paragraph 11.2, but shall still be required
to seek to complete the remainder of the Sprint Requirements in the relevant Sprint.

11.4 Where the Product Owner elects in respect of any given Sprint to cease such Sprint
or to make a material change to a Sprint prior to scheduled completion, and such
Sprint is thus ceased prior to scheduled completion, such Sprint shall be considered
a “Disrupted Sprint”.

11.5 Where a Priority 1 or Priority 2 incident occurs in respect of a given Product (as
determined by Post Office) and such incident is identified through the existing incident
management procedures as being within the remit of the Digital Development Service
as a resolver group, then (unless otherwise specified by Post Office), one or more of
the Sprint Teams for such Product (as directed by the DDS Lead) shall immediately
prioritise resolving such incident, irrespective of the current Sprint Backlog. The
occurrence of such Priority 1 or Priority 2 incident shall be considered a Relief Event
for the impacted Sprints.

12. CHARGES

12.1 In consideration for the provision of the Digital Development Services, Post Office
shall pay to Fujitsu Services the Charges set out in Appendix 5 (DDS Charges) (the
“DDS Charges’).

APPENDIX 1
AGILE METHODOLOGY
1. GENERAL
1.1 The Participants shall adopt an agile development methodology based upon the

“Scrum Framework” for the Products in the Product Roadmap and development work
shall be carried out during a series of Sprints and in accordance with the processes
set out within this Appendix 1 (Agile Methodology).

1.2 Each Sprint shall have a fixed period of two (2) weeks, during which a Sprint Team
shall complete and test Sprint Functionality in respect of all Sprint Requirements in
the Sprint Backlog. On the completion of a Sprint, the Sprint Team shall promptly
commence the next Sprint for which a Sprint Backlog has been prepared in
accordance with paragraphs 1.17 of this Appendix 1 (Agile Methodology).

1.3 The Participants shall use the DDS Tools in the provision of the DDS.

1.4 The total number of Story Points for the User Stories allocated to each Sprint shall
equal the Per Sprint Story Point Allocation for all Standard Sprint Teams. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Sprint Backlog for each Sprint will include additional User
Stories in excess of the Per Sprint Story Point Allocation, which may be used by the
Sprint Team in place of those User Stories due to be completed during such Sprint
where required to enable Fujitsu Services to manage the throughput and achieve the
Per Sprint Story Point Allocation. An example of when this might occur is an
unexpected inability to complete a given User Story during such Sprint.

1.5 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement the parties acknowledge that
the goal of each Sprint is to complete Sprint Functionality to fulfil all Sprint
Requirements within the applicable Sprint Backlog; however, by nature of the agile
approach used in the delivery of the Digital Development Services, it may be the case
that, despite the Sprint Team having completed sufficient Story Points so as to meet
the Per Sprint Story Point Allocation for the applicable Sprint, not all such Sprint
Functionality is completed within such Sprint. Accordingly, for the purposes of the
Service Levels, Fujitsu Services’ performance under this DDS Schedule shall be
assessed against the number of Story Points actually completed and delivered within
each Sprint, rather than the number of Sprint Requirements fulfilled. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the estimated Story Points for a Sprint Requirement
changes during the course of a Sprint then, where agreed between the parties, the
actual Story Point allocation for that Sprint Requirement will be considered for the
purposes of assessing Fujitsu Services pursuant to Appendix 8 (Service Credit
Mechanism).

1.6 Sprints may be run in parallel, where conducted by separate Sprint Teams.
Product Backlog

1.7 A product backlog shall be prepared for each Product by the relevant Product Owner,
using the Product Backlog tool and in consultation with the Product Delivery Manager,
and shall include the following items:

1.8

1.9

1.7.1 aprioritised set of development requirements (which may include bug fixes,
minor enhancements, new feature requests, non-functional requirements,
service requirements and major functionality changes) to be completed,
expressed as User Stories;

1.7.2 the estimated business value of each User Story;

1.7.3 anestimate of the number of Story Points for each User Story, allocated with
reference to the Reference User Stories;

1.7.4 aset of Acceptance Criteria for each User Story and any further details of
these User Stories provided by the Product Owner; and

1.7.5 a Definition of Done for all User Stories,
(the “Product Backlog’).

The Product Owner may add User Stories to the relevant Product Backlog at any time
and, when any such User Story is added, the Product Delivery Manager shall, in
consultation with the Product Owner, set the number of Story Points using the
Estimating Methodology and with reference to the Reference User Stories and the
Acceptance Criteria.

A Product shall be complete once all User Stories in the Product Backlog have been
delivered and the Product Owner has notified Fujitsu Services accordingly.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Product Owner may opt to end the delivery of the
Product at any point prior to the completion of all User Stories.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Product Backlog may include third line support
activities arising as a result of incidents and problems raised by Post Office and
triaged for resolution to the Digital Development Service through the existing incident
management procedures.

User Stories and the Definition of Ready

Before User Stories from the relevant Product Backlog can be included in a Sprint,
they shall meet the following requirements:

Done shall include the criteria set out in Appendix 2 (Definition of Done);

1.13.5 based on the output of the processes in paragraphs 1.13.3 and 1.13.4 of this
Appendix 1 (Agile Methodology), the Sprint Team, working with the Product
Delivery Manager and the Product Owner, shall determine how many of
such User Stories can be completed during such Sprint, provided that the
sum of the Story Points for the User Stories shall equal the Per Sprint Story
Point Allocation;

1.13.6 the Sprint Team, working with the Product Delivery Manager and the Product
Owner, may decide to replace a higher priority User Story with a lower
priority User Story bearing equal or fewer Story Points if it is technically
expedient to do so; and

1.13.7 the Product Delivery Manager and the Product Owner shall agree the final
selection of User Stories to be included in the Sprint Backlog (each, a “Sprint
Requirement’).

1.14 At the Sprint planning meeting, the Product Delivery Manager and the Product Owner
will also identify and agree the specific Sprint Dependencies on Post Office that are
required for the Sprint Team to be able to complete the Sprint Requirements.

1.15 At the Sprint Planning Meeting, the Product Delivery Manager and the Product Owner
will also review and confirm and/or refine which (if any) elements of the Sprint
Functionality will be Listed Rights in accordance with Paragraph 7 of Schedule H
(Digital Intellectual Property Provisions).

1.16 Once the Sprint Requirements for a Sprint have been agreed, no alterations or
additions to the Sprint Requirements (including the estimated number of Story Points,
Definition of Done and Acceptance Criteria) shall be made.

Sprint Backlog

1.17 The Product Delivery Manager shall then prepare the Sprint Backlog in consultation
with the Product Owner, which shall include:

1.17.1 the agreed Sprint Requirements;
1.17.2 the agreed number of Story Points allocated to each Sprint Requirement;

1.17.3 a breakdown of each Sprint Requirement into specific tasks and allocation
to individuals within the Sprint Team;

1.17.4 the Acceptance Criteria for each Sprint Requirement and the Definition of
Done for every Sprint Requirement; and

1.17.5 the agreed Sprint Dependencies.

1.18 The Sprint Backlog shall be completed no later than 10 business days prior to the
start of the applicable Sprint and, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, will contain
at least 120 Story Points worth of User Stories.

Sprints

1.19 During each Sprint, the Sprint Team shall develop the functionality to meet each
Sprint Requirement in accordance with the Sprint Backlog, any agreed coding
standards and this Schedule 13 (Digital Development Services) (the “Sprint
Functionality”).

1.20 By the end of each business day during the course of each Sprint, the Sprint Team
shall ensure that all functionality and other materials developed during the course of
such business day are made available (in their current state of development) in
Source Code form on an agreed code repository, for review by Post Office. The

During each Sprint, the Sprint Team shall maintain the Sprint Backlog and update it
daily to reflect progress towards completion of the Sprint Requirements.

If, during the course of any Sprint, a dispute between the Parties arises in connection
with any Sprint Requirement which cannot be resolved within the Sprint Team, then
such Sprint Requirement shall be immediately removed from the scope of such Sprint
and the Sprint Team will seek to deliver an alternative User Story from the Sprint
Backlog to make up the Per Sprint Story Point Allocation. Where there is no
alternative User Story that is reasonably suitable to be delivered during the Sprint in
place of such Sprint Requirement, then for the purposes of assessing performance
under Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism), the Per Sprint Story Point Allocation
for that Sprint shall be reduced by the number of Story Points allocated to the
removed Sprint Requirement and all Story Points expended on such Sprint
Requirement during the Sprint shall be excluded from any Service Level calculation.

Sprint Review Meetings

Within 5 business days of the last day of each Sprint, the Product Delivery Manager,
the Product Owner and the Sprint Team shall hold a review meeting in respect of
such Sprint (a “Sprint Review Meeting”). At the Sprint Review Meeting, the
Participants shall:

1.23.1 determine whether the Sprint Functionality meets the Acceptance Criteria
for each Sprint Requirement, and the Definition of Done for all Sprint
Requirements, in the Sprint;

1.23.2 agree the manner in which any ongoing support for the Sprint Functionality
will be handled; and

1.23.3 review the Agreed Metrics for the Sprint and, where appropriate, propose
additional measures to be added to the Agreed Metrics for consideration by
the DDS Service Review.

Any Sprint Requirement the Sprint Functionality for which has: (i) not met its
Acceptance Criteria; (ii) not met the relevant Definition of Done; or (iii) not been
developed during the relevant Sprint, shall not be submitted to Post Office for
Acceptance.

Any Sprint Requirement the Sprint Functionality for which has: (i) met its Acceptance
Criteria; and (ii) met the relevant Definition of Done, shall be submitted to Post Office,
in both source and object code form for Acceptance. Within 2 business days of such
submission, the Product Owner shall sign such report to indicate agreement as to
that Sprint Functionality that has been Accepted. Where the Product Owner has not
signed the acceptance report or demonstrated why any Sprint Functionality has not
met the Definition of Done and the Acceptance Criteria in accordance with the above
timescales, Fujitsu Services shall escalate the matter to the Post Office Delivery Lead
who shall use all reasonable endeavours to provide a signed form of acceptance, or
provide reasonable evidence of why any Sprint Functionality has not been Accepted,
within 24 hours of the escalation.

COMMITMENT

Subject to Fujitsu Services complying with the terms of this Schedule, the Post Office
hereby commits that the DDS Charges paid or payable in respect of each of the first
two fiscal years commencing 1 April 2018 (each such fiscal year being a “DDS
Commitment Year”) will equal or exceed £7,358,400 per annum, in the third fiscal
year, commencing 1° April 2020 it will equal or exceed £2,456,384, and in the
subsequent two fiscal years commencing 1st April 2021 and 1st April 2022 for
financial year 1st April 2021 to 31 March 2022 £1,034,602 for financial year 1st April
2022 to 31st March 2023 (the “DDS Commitment’). Fujitsu Services agrees that any
amount which has been spent to date on Development Services between the 1 April
2018 and the DDS Commencement Date will contribute towards the commitment for
the first DDS Commitment Year. The DDS Oversight Roles Service Charge and the
DDS Platform Standing Team Service Charge are excluded from the DDS
Commitment for the two latter DDS Commitment Years (those commencing on 1%
April 2021 and 1% April 2022). The parties agree that the DDS Oversight Roles
Service Charge and the DDS Platform Standing Team Service Charge (regardless of
the activities assigned to the personnel to whom the DDS Oversight Roles Service
Charge and the DDS Platform Standing Team Service Charge relate) shall constitute
Actual Spend for the purposes of the calculation in Schedule 11 (Revenue Switch
Mechanism).

Where Post Office in either the first or second DDS Commitment Years only fails to
meet the commitment set forth within paragraph 2.1 of this Appendix 5 (DDS
Charges):

2.2.1 by an amount equal to or less than £500,000, Post Office shall,
notwithstanding such shortfall, be deemed to have met such commitment in
respect of the given DDS Commitment Year provided that the Charges
within the four (4) month period immediately following the end of the
applicable DDS Commitment Year (the “Remedy Period”) exceed the
amount of the shortfall. For the avoidance of doubt, until such time as the
relevant shortfall is met, the Charges during the Remedy Period shall count
towards the shortfall only and not towards meeting any commitment in the
subsequent DDS Commitment Year (if applicable);

2.2.2 by an amount exceeding £500,000, Fujitsu Services may invoice Post Office
for the shortfall in excess of £500,000 and subsequently paragraph 2.2.1
shall apply in respect of the remaining £500,000 (by way of example, should
Post Office fail to meet the commitment by £600,000, Fujitsu Services may
invoice Post Office for £100,000, with the remaining £500,000 being then
subject to the Remedy Period specified within paragraph 2.2.1 of this
Appendix 5 (DDS Charges)); or

With respect to the final three DDS Commitment Years (ending 31st March 2021,
31st March 2022 and 31st March 2023) paragraphs 2.2.1 to 2.2.3 shall not apply.
Instead, if, in one of the final three DDS Commitment Years, Post Office exceeds the
DDS Commitment for that DDS Commitment Year then the excess shall be credited
against any shortfall in the DDS Commitment for the following DDS Commitment
Year. If, after applying such credit, there remains a shortfall within one of the final
three DDS Commitment Years then Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to invoice Post
Office for such shortfall at the end of the relevant DDS Commitment Year.

Paragraph removed by CCN1670a

ORDERING OF SPRINT TEAM CAPACITY

Subject to paragraph 3.8 below, the parties shall agree the number of Sprint Teams
at the Digital Demand Forecasting Board.

Sprint Teams shall be agreed and ordered in blocks of 6 Sprints to cover a 12-week
period.

Each block of Sprints shall be ordered at least 90 days in advance of their
commencement. For example, the Digital Demand Forecasting Board meeting in
March would order Sprints commencing no earlier than July

Post Office shall confirm the Sprint Team capacity in writing through the minutes of
the meeting and Fujitsu Services shall ensure that the ordered capacity is ready to
commence work in accordance with such order for each ordered Sprint.

Once ordered Sprints can only be adjusted on less than 90 days’ prior notice pursuant
to paragraph 3.6 (for the avoidance of doubt, this shall not affect the ability for the
Digital Demand Forecasting Board to adjust such Sprints with more than 90 days’
prior notice).

Where Post Office requests a change in accordance with paragraph 3.5 the following
shall apply;

3.6.1 Where there is a request to increase the number of Sprint Teams and using
reasonable endeavours Fujitsu Services is able to meet the request, Post
Office shall pay the Charges for such additional Sprint teams in accordance
with paragraph 1.6 above.

3.6.2 I Where there is a request to decrease the number of Sprint Teams allocated
to a specific Product or the number of Sprints then, in addition to the general
ability for the Digital Demand Forecasting Board to reallocate Sprint Teams
between Products, then with Fujitsu Services’ agreement, Post Office may
require the Sprint Teams that are the subject to the reduction request to
undertake other activities not contained within a Product Backlog
(‘Additional Activities”), provided that such Additional Activities are
reasonably within scope of the capabilities and expertise of the applicable

Sprint Team. In such circumstances: (i) the Charges for such Sprint Team
shall remain as scheduled for the applicable period; and (ii) any work
undertaken by such Sprint Team in respect of any Additional Activities shall
be excluded from any assessment of performance by such Sprint Team
pursuant to Appendix 8.

The parties have agreed the initial Sprint Team capacity (being two Sprint Teams)
and following the DDS Commencement Date, Fujitsu Services shall stand up this
number of Sprint Teams and this shall be the minimum number of Sprint Teams
during the first 90 day period following the DDS Commencement Date (the “Ramp-
Up Period”). During the Ramp-Up Period, Fujitsu Services agrees that Post Office
may increase the number of Sprint Teams up to a maximum of 4, provided that:

3.7.1 Post Office provides Fujitsu Services with at least 30 days’ prior notice of the
requirement for an additional Sprint Team;

3.7.2 I where more than 3 concurrent Sprint Teams will be required before 60 days
after the DDS Commencement Date, any additional requested concurrent
Sprint Teams will be subject to paragraph 3.6.1;

3.7.3. where more than 4 concurrent Sprint Teams will be required before 90 days
after the DDS Commencement Date, any additional requested concurrent
Sprint Teams will be subject to paragraph 3.6.1; and

3.7.4 each Sprint Team uses the Standard Sprint Team Structure.
The provisions of this paragraph 3.7 are without prejudice to paragraph 3.6.1.

Within 10 business days of the DDS Commencement Date the parties shall hold a
Digital Demand Forecasting Board and agree and or confirm the number of Sprint
Teams for the next block of 6 Sprints following the Ramp-Up Period.

Annex B contains worked examples of the planning approach for the initial Digital
Demand Forecasting Board.

APPENDIX 7
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TRACKER

In determining whether the IPR in any of the Software to be created pursuant to a Product (or
a Release) is a Listed Right, the Fujitsu Services Architect Owner shall, as part of Product
Initiation consider the requirements and the manner in which the Sprint Requirements could
be delivered by Fujitsu Services. The Architect Owner will liaise with the Product Delivery
Manager and the Product Owner to discuss and agree the IPR strategy for the Product. An
agreed IPR strategy will be contained within the Product Initiation deliverables.

Any changes to the Product Initiation deliverables that relate to FJ Digital Background IPR, KS
IPR or Horizon IPR will be updated as part of any relevant Sprint Review. With respect to the
use of open source or third party IP Rights, recognising the requirement for the Sprint Team
to be able to deliver the User Stories in the most efficient manner possible, the use of any
such open source or third party IP Rights shall be tracked as part of the Sprint Review Report.

To the extent that there is a change to the Product requirements following Product Initiation
that relate to the usage of FJ Digital Background IPR, K5 IPR or Horizon IPR, the Fujitsu
Services Architect Owner shall escalate to the Product Owner and the Delivery Lead such that
the parties may agree upon any revision to the IPR strategy and the same will be tracked
within the updated Product Initiation deliverables accordingly. The parties acknowledge that
such a change in the Product may require the Sprint Team to be re-set prior to re-commencing
the Product delivery.

The Product Owner shall be responsible for ensuring that Post Office’s Chief Technical Office
(or nominated representative) agrees to the IPR strategy (including any changes to the IPR
strategy) with respect to any Sprint Requirement which is to be designed, coded or supplied
as a pre-existing component or an algorithm using any Listed Rights prior to formally approving
the Product to be delivered under DDS.

APPENDIX 8
SERVICE CREDIT MECHANISM

DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION

In this Appendix, the following terms and expressions shall have the meaning set out
below:

“Average Sprint Performance” means in respect of a given Sprint Team, subject to
paragraph 3.1.3 of this Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism), the average
Completion Rate over the previous six Sprints completed by such Sprint Team;

“Completion Rate” means in respect of a given Sprint, the percentage of Story Points
that were scheduled for completion during such Sprint that were actually completed
during such Sprint;

“Expected Service Level” means, in respect of a given Sprint, the expected target
percentage (as set out as the ‘expected’ percentage within Attachment 1 to this
Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism)) of the Story Points due for completion during
such Sprint;

“Improvement Plan” has the meaning given to it in paragraph 4.1 of this Appendix 8
(Service Credit Mechanism);

“Minimum Service Level” means, in respect of a given Sprint, that at least 75% of the
Story Points due for completion during such Sprint were actually completed and
Accepted;

“Sprint Charges” means, in respect of any given Sprint, the total charges payable by
Post Office in respect of such Sprint;

“Sprint Service Credit” means, in respect of any given Sprint, ten per cent (10%) of
the Sprint Charges; and

“Threshold Service Level” means, in respect of a given Sprint, the threshold target

5.1

3.1.1 During each Sprint, Fujitsu Services shall measure its performance against
the Expected Service Level, Threshold Service Level and Minimum Service
Level for such Sprint.

3.1.2 Within the DDS Service Review, Fujitsu Services and Post Office shall review
Fujitsu Services’ performance during the previous two Sprints. Fujitsu
Services shall provide sufficient evidence of its performance during such
Sprints to allow assessment of its performance.

3.1.3. Where the period for assessing the Average Sprint Performance of any given
Sprint Team includes any Disrupted Sprints, such Disrupted Sprints shall be
discounted from the calculated average. By way of example only, where the
relevant 6 month period contained 1 Disrupted Sprint, the Average Sprint
Performance shall be calculated as an average of the remaining 5 Sprints
within such period. Where the number of Disrupted Sprints within any such
period exceeds 2, the period shall be extended until an average can be taken
across at least 4 Sprints that are not Disrupted Sprints.

CORRECTIVE ACTION

Creation of an Improvement Plan

Where, in respect of any Sprint, the Completion Rate fails to meet the Expected
Service Level in respect of such Sprint, Fujitsu Services shall, within 5 business days
of the end of such Sprint, provide Post Office with a written plan for improving Fujitsu
Services’ performance, so as to improve Fujitsu Services’ performance and satisfy
such Service Levels in the future (an “Improvement Plan”) for Post Office’s approval.
In the event that Post Office (acting reasonably) does not approve the Improvement
Plan, Fujitsu Services shall submit a revised plan to address Post Office’s concerns.
For the avoidance of doubt, an Improvement Plan may result in an individual resource
being removed from a Sprint Team where the parties agree that this is an appropriate
action to help to address Fujitsu Services’ performance issues).

Implementation of Improvement Plan

Upon Post Office’s approval, the Improvement Plan shall be implemented by Fujitsu
Services in accordance with the timescales set out in the Improvement Plan and
Fujitsu Services shall bear the cost of performing its obligations and responsibilities
under such Improvement Plan. During the implementation of such Improvement Plan,
Fujitsu Services shall provide to Post Office weekly status reports containing
progress updates until such time as Fujitsu Services’ performance is fully evidenced
to be in compliance with the applicable Service Level. For the avoidance of doubt, the
implementation of the Improvement Plan shall not relieve Fujitsu Services of any
obligations hereunder or from incurring additional Sprint Service Credits.

SPRINT SERVICE CREDITS

This paragraph 5 of Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism) shall not apply until 1
November 2018.

Calculation
Where, in respect of any Sprint, the Completion Rate fails to meet:

(i) the Minimum Service Level (a “Minimum Service Level Default”); or

(ii) the Threshold Service Level (but does not fail to meet the applicable Minimum
Service Level) in respect of such Sprint and the Average Sprint Performance
by Fujitsu Services does not exceed the Threshold Service Level,

then, subject to paragraphs 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 of this Appendix 8 (Service Credit
Mechanism), Fujitsu Services shall pay to Post Office an amount equal to the Sprint
Service Credit for the applicable Sprint, which shall be applied as a credit for the next
invoice as a separate line item.

In no circumstances will the total amounts payable by Fujitsu Services in Sprint Service
Credits for any given Sprint exceed 10% of the Sprint Charges for such Sprint.

Subject to paragraph 6.1 of this Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism), but without
prejudice to paragraph 4 (Corrective Action), the payment of Sprint Service Credits
shall be the Post Office’s sole remedy with respect to any failure to meet the Service
Levels.

Where a new Product is introduced to the DDS Service or a new Sprint Team
commences (as described in the table set out in Attachment 1 to this Appendix 8
(Service Credit Mechanism)), then the Threshold Service Level shall apply for the first
3 or 5 Sprints (as applicable) prior to it becoming set at the “Existing Team” levels. For
the purposes of calculating the Average Sprint Performance across 6 Sprints which
include new Products or new Sprint Teams, the Threshold Service Level will be
calculated as the average of the Threshold Service Level targets across all of the 6
Sprints for the purposes of determining whether a Sprint Team has meet the Average
Sprint Performance. An example of this process is set out beneath the table in
Attachment 1 to this Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism).

TERMINATION

Where the average Completion Rate across any twelve (12) consecutive Sprints
across all Sprint Teams commencing at any time after 1 November 2018, fails to meet
the Threshold Service Level (“Critical Service Failure”), then, notwithstanding
paragraph 5.4 of this Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism), provided that during
such period there were an average of at least four (4) Sprint Teams running
consecutively, Post Office may terminate the Digital Development Service a result of
Default by Fujitsu Services by giving Fujitsu Services no less than sixty (60) days’ prior
written notice. In the event of any Critical Service Failure, paragraph 5.4 of this
Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism) shall cease to apply.

6.2 If, in the event of a Critical Service Failure, Post Office commences proceedings
against Fujitsu Services in respect of the provision of the Digital Development Services
by Fujitsu Services in relation to one or more Products, Fujitsu Services shall not be
required to (but may if it so chooses to) provide further Digital Development Services
in respect of such Product(s) and Fujitsu Services or Post Office may elect for Fujitsu
Services to cease to provide Digital Development Services in respect of such
Product(s) on providing at least 10 business days’ prior written notice to Post Office,
and in that case:

Fujitsu Services will use all reasonable endeavours to procure an orderly and
efficient transition from the provision of the DDS for the Product so terminated
to the Post Office or a Replacement Service Provider;

for the avoidance of doubt, Fujitsu Services shall continue to provide Digital
Development Services in accordance with this Schedule I3 in respect of all
other Products;

the Charges relating to the Product Roles and the Sprint Teams associated
with the terminated Product shall cease to apply from the date of termination
(the “Product Reduction Amount”) and the Charges related to the Platform
Standing Team Charges and the Oversight Roles Charges shall be reviewed
by the parties with a view to reducing them by a percentage equal to the
average Sprint Team Charges for the affected Product(s) over the previous 6
month period as a proportion of the DDS Charges (excluding the Platform
Standing Team Charges, Oversight Roles Charges and Tooling Charges)
until such time as new Products are introduced or additional concurrent Sprint
Teams are engaged to support existing Products that require additional
resources within the Platform Standing Team or Oversight Roles, or such
other proportion taking reasonable account of the continued provision of DDS
(the “Product Reduction Percentage”). The DDS Commitment for the
remainder of the current DDS Commitment Year and for each subsequent
DDS Commitment Year shall also be reduced by the Product Reduction
Amount and, for so long as it applies, by a percentage equivalent to the
Product Reduction Percentage; and

the annual liability cap referenced in Clause 14.1(ii) shall be reduced by the
Product Reduction Amount for each subsequent year of the DDS Term and,
for so long as it applies, (for each subsequent year of the DDS Term) by a
percentage equivalent to the Product Reduction Percentage.

* A ‘New Product’ Sprint Team refers to a Sprint Team supporting a new Product that has not
previously formed part of the scope of activity undertaken by Fujitsu Services as part of the
Digital Development Services. For clarity, an Existing Team moving to a New Product will
have the New Product measures applied.

** A ‘New Team’ Sprint Team refers to any new Sprint Team created to provide support for an
existing Product that already forms part of the scope of activity undertaken by Fujitsu Services
as part of the Digital Development Services.

** The number of Sprints completed by a Sprint Team refers to the number of concurrent
complete Sprints undertaken by the specific Sprint Team in question, starting from the first
Sprint undertaken by that Sprint Team since the last Product Initiation.

WORKING EXAMPLE

Working Example of calculating Average Sprint Performance where the Threshold Service
Level is at different figures during the 6 Sprint measurement Period.

NEW PRODUCT
Threshold is 75 Story Points for first 5 sprints, then 85 for subsequent sprints

Anew Product is introduced and the Sprint Team performs as follows:

Sprint Performance has been met.

SPRINT TEAMS COMMENCING PRIOR TO 1ST NOVEMBER

A new Sprint Team commences DDS on 1* October. For Sprints 1 and 2, Service Levels
shall be measured but no Service Credits will apply. For Sprints 3 onwards, the Threshold
Service Levels and Expected Service Levels will be as per the table but Service Credits will
apply.
