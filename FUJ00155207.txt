fhe CofABalance 551000 object should be updated each day (normally at EOD) to include the CofASummary figure for the account. In
some instances this is not happening. Two cases I have found recently happened when the gateway had been rebooted and was writing
loverdue CABS messages. The CofASummary messages and trailer for a previous day were written successfully, but processing stopped
before the CofABalance persistent object was updated. On restart, the check probably found the trailer and assumed the process
was complete, but did not notice that the object had not been updated.

[the figure is needed because it is sent to POL within the LFS cash statement (GeneratedCash attribute). If it is wrong, some of
pOL's cross checks may fail, and they may question why there is a difference between this figure and POLFS. There is now a

ech. which realigns the CofABalance at EOD after end of Trading Period, but it would be better if we can remove this
inconsistency and get it produced properly at the outset.

could an extra check be made within CABSProcess to see whether the EODDate in the object is equal to (or greater than?) the
lcoppate being processed? If not, the required summary line could be found via the CofABSP Trailer object.

It attach messagestore extracts from two recent examples:
IFAD 169859, CofASummary for 2nd Oct written 4th Oct 11:06 GMT, CofABalance not updated;
IFAD 118807, CofASummary for 21st Sep written 22nd Sep 12:01 GMT, CofABalance not updated.

the writing of the CofABSP Trailer object and the CofABalance objects will be written atomically using a handle created by the
StartTransaction method. In this way either the whole set will be written or none at all. This will ensure that you are not left
lin a confused state if the machine is rebooted in the middle of writing out the CABSProcess output records.

Fixed by a new release of CABSProcess.

low the transactions written for each day by CABSProcess are written atomically - i.e. all or none. In particular on the final
day the <Collection:CofABSP><ObjectName:Trailer> and the <Collection:CofABalance><ObjectName:551000> are written atomically and
so it is not possible to have one without the other.

CABSProcess has now been changed so that all transactions are written atomically even when it catches up on multiple days.

Discussions with Anne Chambers show that even on the busisest of offices it will be able to catch up at least 16 days.
