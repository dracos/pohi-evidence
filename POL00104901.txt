or Agents. In order to prosecute offenders the following matters must be proved;

3.1.1 The person must be engaged in the business of a postal operator.

3.1.2 Contrary to their duty. Some duties involve employees opening mail for example at the National
Returns Centre (NRC) Belfast and occasionally delaying mail such as not delivering to unsafe
addresses. This point therefore protects a person who is acting in accordance with his/her duty from
committing a criminal offence.

3.1.3 Without Reasonable Excuse. The Investigator must prove that the suspect did not have a reasonable
excuse to open or delay postal packets.

3.1.4 Intentionally delays or opens. In the case of “delay” it must be demonstrated that the delay was
caused by a deliberate act or a deliberate omission on the part of the offender. In other words,
accidental mishandling will not suffice. In cases of “opening” it must be shown that the offender
physically opened items although a slight or partial opening will suffice. It is also worthy of note
that neither opening nor delay require any dishonesty, they only require intent.

3.1.5 Postal Packet in course of transmission by Post. Reasonable inference that an item was in course of
transmission by post can be taken if we can identify the sender who confirms the item was posted or
the addressee who confirms non receipt.

3.1.6 Intentionally Opening Mailbags. This offence can also be committed if a person opens or delays a
mail bag (rather that a postal packet) contrary to their duty or without reasonable excuse.

3.1.7 Maximum sentence. On indictment 2 years imprisonment or a fine or both.

Section 84 Interfering with the Mail - General
3.2.1 Section 84(1) provides for it to be an offence if a person intentionally delays or opens postal
packets whilst in the course of transmission by post without a reasonable excuse.

postal operator has given general or specific permission for anything to be enclosed in a postal
packet, or

offender and addressee are not material.

3.3.5 It must be proved that the packet was or had been in the post

3.3.6Maximum Sentence. The maximum sentence on indictment is 12 months imprisonment or a fine or both.

offices, post boxes or other property belonging to or used by a Universal Service Provider (USP) in
connection with the provision of a universal postal service and other damage or disfigurement to such
property.
