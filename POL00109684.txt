Hello both

Paula and I have just agreed this as the final version.

POL-0111071
POL00109684
POL00109684

She has asked, however, that both of you have a final read.

Subject to any critical changes, can I then ask Avene to top and tail it (salutations and removing the DRAFT — PRIVATE
AND CONFIDENTIAL bit at the top) and send it out electronically and with hard copy with her real/formal signature to
follow on Monday first thing.

Could Avene then please send the version as send to the wider copy list from yesterday (Belinda, Mark D, Tom W, Chris
A, Mel Corfield, Mark underwood1, Rodric Williams and myself) ?

Many thanks

Patrick
