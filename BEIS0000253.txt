LETTER FROM ICL: TIMING OF PUBLICATION OF NAO
REPORT ON CANCELLATION OF THE BENEFIT PAYMENT
CARD PROJECT

1. George Hall, Director of Corporate Affairs at ICL wrote to you on 30
June to express concern about the timing of publication of the National
Audit Office study on the cancellation of the Benefit Payment Card (BPC)
project. ICL wanted early publication to minimise the adverse effect on
their planned flotation in the autumn of a report which shows the company's
performance on the Horizon project in a less than flattering light.

2. The decision on whether to publish this side of the summer recess
was taken right to the wire by DSS determination to play hardball with the
NAO on drafting amendments prior to acceptance of the report. In the
event a compromise text was accepted last Wednesday, which allowed the
report to be placed before Parliament (on Thursday), in turn clearing the
way for publication on probably 10 August. We made sure that DSS and
NAO were reminded of ICL's concerns throughout the final negotiations,
and ICL were kept in touch with the developing situation. It would
however be apropriate for you now to write briefly to the company
expressing satisfaction that an outcome which meets the company's
concerns has been achieved. A draft is attached.

DAVID SIBBICK
