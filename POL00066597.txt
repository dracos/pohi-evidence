Signature i

I am the Operations Manager for Post Office Ltd, Audit and Inspections team. I have held this

position for four years and have been employed by Royal Mail Group for ten years.

As part of the post audit process, members of the audit and inspections team carry out a reconciliation
of inward and outward remittances for an office cash account, following an audit. I am notified of any

large discrepancies.

On 6 March 2003, I was notifies of a large discrepancy, in excess of £300,000 (Three Hundred
Thousand Pounds) in connection with the Walton on Thames post office. I satisfied myself that the
necessary checks had been made and that this was not some “paper error”. I then made
arrangements for Mr Paul BOSON to attend Walton On Thames post office the next day, 7 March

2003, to carry out a further audit.

From office records I have obtained copies of the audit reports for Walton On Thames for 23°° May
2002 and 15" November 2002. I now produce these items as MD/1 and MD/2. I have signed an

exhibit label for each of these items.
