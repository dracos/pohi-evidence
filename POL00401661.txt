Dear Colin,

Key Refresh - Clause 409

I write in response to your letter of 6th September.

The obligation of ICL Pathway to refresh the keys as set out in document RS/FSP/001
is subject (at several points, including at sections 8.3.2.5, 8.7.2.2) to agreement with

the Contracting Authorities. POCL considers that such agreement has not taken place.

Without prejudice to POCL’s rights under the Codified Agreement, POCL proposes
the following:

e That, as you agree, POCL and ICL Pathway continue to progress the matters set
out in bullet points 2, 3, and 4 in POCL’s letter of 5th September.

e That ICL Pathway raises a CCN in order to amend documents RS/FSP/001 and
CS/PRO/090 to include the key refresh procedure, when this procedure has been
agreed.

e That anew CCD relating to key refresh be introduced.

Yours sincerely,

Keith Baines I
