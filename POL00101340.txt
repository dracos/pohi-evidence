Well done mark. In the circumstances this feels quite balanced.

All

This is the BBC online report around Horizon. Earlier inaccuracies have been corrected and our
clear line included. We will continue to monitor coverage, though it is pleasingly low on BBC
schedules.

We will update Board in morning. BIS are aware and in loop. Jo Swinson has requested a brief
for the moming - we are working with Richard Callard on that.

Worth reminding ourselves that this is what we expected to happen and in the current news
agenda this is not likely to stay in the news cycle for long.

Please do let me know any queries.

Mark
