HORIZON SUSPENCE

DURING MIGRATION AND STARTING HORIZON WE LOST £541.19,

ON THE NEXT DAY WHILST SUPERVISED A FURTHER 30.00 WAS LOST, LOOKING BACK NOW I SHOULD
HAVE PUT INTO SUSPENSE ACCOUNT, AND NOT MADE GOOD,

‘T DURING ALL THIS WAS BOTH SURPRISED AND WENT THROUGH EVERYTHING
HIMSELF, AND COULD NOT FIND ANY FAULTS.

MY RNM AND GARY ADDERLEY REVIEWED THE SITUATION AND NEITHER COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE
MISSING MONEY. SEii LETTER ATTACHED. NO SUPPORT WAS RECEIVED OTHER THAN ABOVE, AND
FURTHER CONTACT WITH HORIZON ONLY BROUGHT COMMENTS LIKE IT IS NOT OUR PROELEM.
EVENTUALLY A LADY WROTE TO ME BUT IT WAS ONLY A POLITE LETTER WITH NO PATH OR ACTION FOR
RESOLUTION. IT AUSO SAID THAT ITEMS WHERE CLEARED WHICH WAS NOT TRUE. IN FACT HORIZON
CLOSED SEVERAI. PC)INTS ON THEIR OWN BACK, AND IN SOME CASES I INSISTED THEY WHERE RE
OPENED. TO PUT I't SLUNTLY THEY WHERE ONLY INTERESTED IN GIVING AN ANSWER THEY CONSIDERED
OK, AND THEN WANTED TO CLOSE THE ISSUE.

AFURTHER £109,52 WAS ALSO INVESTIGATED IN WEEK 25, WHICH I MADE GOOD BUT BELISVE NOW THAT
1 SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE.

OCTOBER GIRO TRANSACTIONS CUT OFF AFTER ISSUE OF REPORT, APPEARED AGAIN NEXT DAY.
BECAUSE OF PROBLEMS BEING EXPERIENCED WE ACTUALLY PRINTED ANOTHER REPORT TO SHOW THAT
NO TRANSACTIONS EAD BEEN MISSED, AND A REPORT WAS GENERATED TO SHOW NO NEW
TRANSACTIONS }14.0 TAKEN PLACE, THE RECORDS WHERE SEEN BY MY RNM WHO AGREED THAT IT
HAD HAPPENED :

25-10-00 COULD NOT GET CASHFLOW TO WORK HAD TO RE BOOT COMPUTER.

OTHER EXPERIENCES -- CASHFLOW FIGURES WHERE DOUBLING UP—HORIZON SAYS WE WHERE PUTTING
IN TWICE, WHICH WE WHERE NOT, AND ALSO WITNESSED BY POCL ON ONE OCCASION. HORIZON NOT
INTERESTED,

SEVERAL RE BOOTS 0UE TO MALFUNCTION OF SCREEN, SCANNER,PROCESSOR.

DURING A PENSION GROUP 13 ENTRY OF VALUE THE SCREEN CHANGED AND PRINTED A RECEIPT. THE
HELP DESK EXPLA!NED WHAT HAD HAPPENED, SOI ACTUALLY DID WHAT THEY SAID AND IT DID NOT DO
WHAT HAPPENED. ANOTHER UNEXPLAINED OCCURRENCE, AGAIN HORIZON NOT INTERESTED.

AAD TO ADJUST STOCK ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WHEN THERE SHOULD NOT HAVE BERN ANY CHANGE.
APS FUNCTION WOULD NOT WORK ONE DAY,

CANNOT GET CONTINUITY BETWEEN CASH ON HAND AND SNAPSHOT, HOWEVER HARD I TRIED.

2 POSITION SAID OTHER SCREEN OUT OF ACTION, SAID OK AND IT PUT ON A TV LICENCE.

20-10-00. THIS IS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED, AND AFTER A LOT OF COMPLAINING 1 WAS
CONTACTED BY DAVE SMITH , IF 1 REMEMBER CORRECTLY, WHO CONSIDERED I HAD A SERIES OF
PROBLEMS THAT NEEDED FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

IN ORDER TO COOPERATE SOMEBODY ELSE TOOK OVER THE POST OFFICE WHILST 1 WORKED WITH DAVE
ON POSITION 2.

DAVE ASKED FOR AN OFFICE SNAPSHOT TO BE PRINTED, WHICH I DID, PARTWAY THROUGH THE
COMPUTER SWITCHEI OFF, LOGGED BACK ON. DAVE WENT AWAY AND CAME BACK LATER AND
CONFIRMED THA'T ‘THE COMPUTER HAD SWITCHED OFF ON ITS OWN ACCORD, NOT INSTRUCTED BY ME,
AND THERE WAS NO RECORD OF THE OCCURRENCE, AND THEY COULD SEE 1 HAD SUBSHIQUENTLY RE
BOOTED.

THE COMPUTER WAS CHANGED.

ONCE THE COMPUTER WAS CHANGED THINGS CAME QUICKLY IN TO CONTROL AND ON THE 20-10-2001
PHOTOCOPIED SOME DOCUMENTS THAT SHOWED THE CASH ON THE SNAPSHOT AND CASH DECLARATION
AS BEING WITHIN 46P. AN EXCELLENT IMPROVEMENT ON WHAT HAD BEEN HAPPENING, OTHER
MYSTERIOUS OCCURENCES ALSO STOPPED.

SINCE THEN ALL DISCREPENCIES HAVE BEEN ACCOUNTABLE FOR IN THE END.
