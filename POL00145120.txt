Thank you for your time on the telephone yesterday.

We expect to receive Second Sight's Interim Report late Thursday / early Friday. I will forward it to you as soon as it is
to hand so that you can review it for factual accuracy and (as requested by our Chairman) any possible defamation
issues. We will want as quick a turnaround as possible.

To help you, I attach:

    1.  The Terms of Reference pursuant to which Second Sight have been operating;
    2.  The "Concerns with Horizon" document which set out a mechanism by which Subpostmasters could raise
       issues with Horizon for consideration by Second Sights. This also sets out a little bit more about how Second
       Sight should conduct its review and report its findings;
    3. A brief for the meeting which our Chairman, CEO, and Company Secretary had with James Arbuthnot MP this
       morning;
    4. An internal POL Briefing Note on the Interim Report, which expands on many of the issues raised in the
       meeting brief; and
    5. The "Spot Review Bible" (see below).

Second Sight has approached its review by identifying specific issues and forwarding them to us for comment. We
have called these "Spot Reviews".

The four specific cases the subject of the Interim Report are covered in Spot Reviews 1, 5, 21 and 22. The "Spot
Review Bible" embeds the requests in from Second Sight and our responses (which were prepared with assistance
from Fujitsu, which supplies the Horizon platform).

Please let me know if you would like me to talk you through any of these documents or any issue in more detail, or if
you need any further information.

Kind regards, Rodric
