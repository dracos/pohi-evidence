App 15 Question and Answer Form For Use At MIB/UAE 43

1.Management Summary

This document describes the processes in place for POCL to support the Horizon
Implementation Programme in mandating Training during the 5 day training window.
{t_also describes the processes for supporting :-

¢ Competency Testing

e MIBs

e UAE

ICL Pathway are providing 4 key events for users they are :-

MIBs

UAEs

Training Course for Managers
Training Course for Assistants.

eeee

These events are critical to the success of the Horizon project. It is in POCLs interest
to maximise attendance at the Management Infrastructure Briefing and the User
Awareness Events. It is a contractual obligation on POCL to ensure all staff are
released to attend training within the 5 day training window. The associated text and
flow charts demonstrate how POCL will ensure our obligations are met. Three
documents (BP/PRD/014 and IM/TRN/SS/00 land 002) further support POCL
commitment

2.Scope

This document describes in detail how POCL will aim to maximise attendance at
MIBs and UAEs and Mandate attendance at Training . It will form part of POCLs
communication cascade to Regions of their role and the process’s they are to use

during National Roll out for Horizon Training and Awareness. The process’s are

further supported by ICL Pathways Document Ref IMP/REQ/014

It is shown in Flow chart format supported by a text description of each of the
processes and at what time the activity will take place. It incorporates the different
scenarios which will occur and the relevant action taken by POCL Regions in
scheduling and mandating training.

It puts in place formal process’s for all individuals to attend Training and
demonstrates the pro-active approach and commitment POCL has to ensure the
success of Horizon in the outlets.

The process to manage minimum training compliance is still being developed and will
be detailed in a later document.

This document also describes contingency procedures which are in place to fully
support POCLs contractual obligation and subsequent CARs 531/532.

3.How To Use This Document

This document follows the implementation cycle where users of the Horizon Platform
are involved. It gives a step by step account of each of the processes involved for
outlet and regional staff . It is further supported by flow charts and timescales for each
process. NOTE: Timescales in brackets reflect the reduced time available to resolve
an issue when it impacts on installation. ICL Pathways documents SY/REP/021 and
IMP/REQ/014 further support the process’s described in this document.

4.Management Infrastructure Briefing (MIB)

4.1 Overview of the Event

The MIB is aimed at the outlet managers of the network only. Invitations are also
extended to landlords via the outlet Manager if they wish to attend. If the landlord
does wish to attend then this needs to be confirmed with ICL Pathway so that their
name can be added to the list of attendees.

The MIB is the first real involvement that the outlet manager has with the Horizon
implementation cycle. The event is scheduled for an evening attendance and lasts
approximately 2 hours. Attendance at the event is not mandatory although POCL are
committed to maximising attendance. (see app1)

The evening starts at 19.00 where outlet managers sign in. Any manager who has said
they would attend but subsequently fails to turn up is later sent a MIB pack
explaining what is going to happen at their outlet. Additionally POCL will send a
letter/phone the outlet, (see appendix 8) to explain the importance of reading the
pack. The event is run by ICL Pathway and is delivered via video, slides and Horizon
Demonstration Equipment. It describes in detail the 23 week Infrastructure cycle and
gives an overview of the 12 week Implementation cycle.

During the event there is the opportunity to see the Horizon equipment and to ask any
questions of both ICL Pathway and POCL.

A questionnaire is completed by the outlet manager(s) to enable ICL Pathway to
measure their satisfaction and understanding. The outputs will be shared and
distributed to POCL accordingly SU/REP/021 refers.

4.2 Support Attendance

At the event itself POCL will support it with the attendance of a survey support
manager (SSM) and a relevant invite for RNMs to attend providing they have
informed the RLM so that their name can be added to the list of attendees, which are
notified to ICL Pathway via the Forward Schedule Return. (see para 5.4 for detailed
description of process)

to Support National Rollout Ver: 1.0
Date: 10/08/98

4.3 Role Of The Survey Support Manager (SSM) At The Event

The SSMs role at the MIB is a relatively small one .They are there to show support by
POCL at the events, and to answer any POCL related questions on infrastructure
issues.

They will use the” car park ”, ie any outstanding questions which cannot be answered
at the end of the event will be taken away, and actioned by POCL as described in app1
and para 10.3

These questions will be added to the Q&A brief and circulated to RLMs/HIMs and
ICL Pathway for onward distribution.

4.4 Question And Answer Process

At the mid point stage of the event outlet managers are asked to complete a questions
sheet which is then handed to the ICL Pathway administrator . The administrator,
presenter, and the POCL representative assess the questions and prepare the answers
as appropriate . At the end of the event the questions raised are read out and the
answers given to all the audience, by the appropriate person using the Q&A brief
documented answers .

4.5 Refusal Or Failure To Attend MIB

Attendance is not mandatory but it is desirable and POCL is committed to encourage
attendance by all outlet managers .

POCL has a process described in this document (see para 10.1) where attendance is
encouraged separately by the Regions as a result of sight of ICL Non Attendance
Report (ref SU/REP/021).

Where an outlet manager cannot or will not attend then a MIB pack is sent, followed
by a letter or phone call from POCL stating the importance of reading the
information. (see appendix 8)

4.6 Specialist /Surveyor Or Visitor Attending MIB

Failure to notify ICL Peritas of attendees may result in the individuals being told at the
door they cannot attend (see appendix 1a). It is important that numbers are controlled
due to the size of the room booked and Health & Safety and Fire Regulations. RLMs
are proactively conveying this message via internal POCL communication. This
process is described in detail section 10.2 appendix la.

5.0 User Awareness Event

5.1 Overview of the Event

The UAE is aimed at the 72,000 individuals who are invited to attend an event by ICL
Pathway supported by POCL.

The UAE is the first event that the outlet managers’ staff will attend, and will give
them the opportunity to see first hand the capabilities of the Horizon system and
understand the reason behind automation.

The event is scheduled for an evening attendance and lasts approximately 2 hours.
Attendance at the event is not mandatory however, POCL are committed to
maximising attendance. (See app 2)

The evening starts at 19.00 where outlet managers sign in. Any manager who has said
they would attend but subsequently fails to turn up is later sent a UAE pack
explaining what is going to happen at their outlet. Additionally POCL will send a
letter or phone the outlet to explain the importance of reading the pack (see appendix
9). The event is run by ICL Pathway and is delivered via video, slides and Horizon
Demonstration Equipment. It gives an overview of the 23 week Infrastructure cycle
which the outlet has just been through and explains in detail the 12 week
Implementation Cycle that they are now moving into.

During the event there is the opportunity to see the Horizon equipment and to ask any
questions of both ICL Pathway and POCL.

A questionnaire is completed by the outlet manager(s) to enable ICL Pathway to
measure their satisfaction and understanding. The outputs will be shared and
distributed to POCL accordingly SU/REP/021 refers.

5.2 Support Attendance

At the event POCL will support, with the attendance of an RNM and/or a POCL
manager.

5.3 Role Of The Retail Network Or POCL Manager At The Event

The RNMs role at the UAE is a relatively small one (see para 11.2). They are there to
show support by POCL at the events, and to answer any POCL related questions on
survey issues.

They will use the” car park ” process. Any outstanding questions which cannot be
answered at the end of the event will be taken away and actioned by POCL as
described in (app2 and para 11.3)

These questions will be added to the Q&A brief and circulated to RLMs/HIMs and
ICL Pathway for onward distribution.

5.4 Question And Answer Process

At the mid point stage of the event outlet managers are asked to complete a questions
sheet which is then handed to the ICL Pathway administrator .

The administrator, presenter, and the POCL representative assess the questions and
prepare the answers as appropriate . At the end of the event the questions raised are
read out and the answers given to all the audience, using the Q&A brief documented
answers .

5.5 Refusal Or Failure To Attend UAE

Attendance is not mandatory but it is desirable and POCL is committed to encourage
attendance by all outlet managers .

POCL has a process described in this document (see para 11.1) where attendance is
encouraged separately by the Regions as a result of sight of ICL Non Attendance
Report (ref SU/REP/021).

Where an outlet manager cannot or will not attend then a UAE pack is sent, followed
by a letter or phone call from POCL stating the importance of reading the information.
(see appendix 9)

5.6 Specialist Or Visitor Attending UAE

Failure to notify ICL Pathway of attendees may result in the individuals being told at
the door they cannot attend (see appendix 2a). It is important that numbers are
controlled due to the size of the room booked and Health & Safety and Fire
Regulations. RLMs are proactively conveying this message via internal POCL
communication.This process is described in detail in section 11.2 appendix 2a.

6.Training

6.1 Overview Of Training

Training is being offered to the circa 72,000 managers, subpostmasters, counter
assistants, reliefs and support staff working within the POCL network.

Training will take place within a five day window prior to the installation of the
Horizon System in an outlet. The outlet manager and deputy/substitute will be given a
1. 5 day contiguous course in a training centre local to their outlet. The course is
based on modules covering all the main counter activities (including Horizon Reports
and balancing) carried out by the outlet manager. At the end of the course a
competency test will be administered with a “pass /fail score” per requirement 915
and CAR 53] (see para 6.2 )

Counter assistants for all outlet types will be given a 1 day course followed by a same
day competency test

Regions are not required to organise catering as Tea/ coffee and a lunch will be
provided for the first day of training . Tea /Coffee is available on the second day for
Managers.

Specialist training courses are also being developed for :-

HFSOs. - 3 days POCL induction, 2 days manager course and 5 day HFSO
POCL Trainers - 5 days
POCL Auditors - 2 days
POCL Security - 2 days
POCL Helplines - 1 day

as defined in SU/TRN/001 Training Needs Analysis

6.2 Competency Testing

At the end of all the training individuals attending will be given a competency test
based on the skill set they need to operate the Horizon system. For example a counter
assistant who is not the subpostmaster’s substitute, will not be tested on preparing an
office balance.

During Roll Out it is compulsory for all users of Horizon to take a competency test
either as part of training or remedial training. Should the individual fail, then they will
be given two more attempts to pass. The first remedial training may be in the same
evening as their original course and will only be on the modules failed. Should they
still fail a second time then they will be given the opportunity to attend a further
remedial training course within the 5 day training window. Only if MTC is not
affected would training be offered in the two days post Go Live.

POL00089741
POCL POCL Processes For Training and Awareness Scheduling —_ Ref: BP/PRD/013
to Support National Rollout Ver: 1.0
Date: 10/08/98

If the subpostmaster fails three times, then the outlet will have to be withdrawn from
the Rollout schedule if a substitute cannot be found to run the outlet (see appendix 7).

If a Subpostmaster refuses remedial training or refuses to take a competency test then
the process described in( appendix 5) is invoked.

It is recommended that each region set aside a resource of one or two trainers who can
provide (for the subpostmaster only) back up training . For assistants it will be the
responsibility of the subpostmaster to give additional support along with the HFSO.

An outlet could still Go Live if the Subpostmaster has failed the competency test
providing a substitute manager has passed.

6.3 Mandate Attendance

POCL is contractually committed to ensure all 72,000 individuals are released to
attend training in the five day window. The ISD process will be used by POCL to
identify individuals who may refuse to attend prior to ICL Pathway contacting them.

A process has been developed to manage such an occurrence and is shown at
(appendix 5) and supporting text is shown in (para 14) POCL will in addition to the
ISD process be embarking on an internal communication campaign using various
mechanisms confirm the message that training is not an option. Additionally at the
MIB and UAE it is further stressed that training is mandatory.

Communications Planned are :-

e A letter to the NFSP explaining its position regarding mandatory attendance.

e A letter to every Subpostmaster from their Regional General Manager Stating
POCL position on all Horizon activities

e Communication Pack for each outlet describing the activities that will take place
during the 39 week Implementation cycle.

6.4 Role Of RNM/RLM

The roles of the above will be pivotal to the success of the Horizon training
programme. The first point of contact will be the RLM, whether it is being proactive
in identifying potential non attendees, prior to training joining instructions or it is
acting upon processes in place, as identified in this document ( see app 5 and 6)

The RNM will work closely with the RLM when a situation arises which the RLM has
been unable to resolve. It will be the responsibility of the RNM to ensure attendance
or invoke agreed procedures i.e (continued refusal to attend) with the individual
concerned (see appendix 5 & 6).

6.5 Refusal Or Failure To Attend

This is an area which could have a major impact on the Rollout Schedule. POCL, as
previously mentioned, are committed to ensuring all individuals attend training
however POCL experience shows that there will be opposition and indeed refusal to
attend. The process for dealing with such eventualities are shown at appendices 5, 6,
10, & 11.

The success of the Horizon Rollout is dependent upon POCL having in place a policy
to deal with any and all eventualities, this policy will form part of this document and
is shown via a flow chart supported by a description of each of the activities for
clarification.

6.6 Minimum Training Compliance (MTC)

MTC is an agreed and documented process, a matrix has been developed by POCL
and shared with ICL as part of POCL requirement during roll out. This demonstrates
the minimum number of staff who must have passed a competency test before the
outlet can go live or be installed. An outlet cannot go live if the outlet manager or a
substitute has not passed the competency test (see appendix 7).

MTC is monitored on a daily basis by ICL Pathway with the information of those
failing a competency test being passed electronically to ICL Pathways Implementation
Team the RLMs and copied to the HIMs for actioning

6.7 Specialist Training

The booking of specialist on training courses will be the responsibility of the RLM to
control. Due to the work loads of specialists and the time that this work is booked in
advance , different booking arrangements will need to be in place. The process for
boking specialists on courses is described in detail in Para 13.

7.Regional Key Dependencies

There are a number of areas where rollout is dependent on regional support. These are
as follows:-

« Necessary communications links and data transfers are in place between ICL
Pathway, TAC and Regions

e The RLM and HIM teams are in place and fully resourced and aware of the
contractual commitments in this document

e RNMsare able to be contacted by the RLM and HIM teams

e RNMsare able to react to issues timely and reply to the RLM/HIM teams within
agreed timescales

e RNMsare fully briefed on the implications of their responsibilities related to the
Horizon rollout

e the relevant communication channels are in place within POCL to pass on Horizon
updates around the Q&A process from MIBs and UAEs

e Regional staff are released for training

«© aPOCL representative is present at the evening MIB and UAEs

e helplines are fully briefed on the activities taking place

© a floating resource of one or two trainers are available for support of

subpostmasters, branch managers or their regular substitutes have failed to pass the
competency test.

8. Regional Resource

It is likely that there will be an impact on RNMs time when issues arise. The actual
time impact is difficult to quantify as the number of issues which might arise is an
unknown. If we look at the Ic release the small amount of RNMs with outlets
involved did spend quite some time sorting out problems with outlets.

Regional resource input will be required from the training section to support outlets
where the subpostmaster, branch manager or staff have failed the competency test
three times.

9.Measures

The measurement of activities in the areas described in this document will be capture
via the baselined ICL Pathway Standard Reports and Format document.
(SU/REP/021)

10. Management Infrastructure Briefing Description of Flow Charted
Process At Appendix 1

10.1 POCLs Approach To Support Attendance

ICL Pathway issue invitations (10.2) each Friday at week 0.

e the outlet manager is given 8 working days to return the response form (10.3). If
the response form has not been returned, the TAC (ICL Pathway) will telephone
the outlet manager to ensure that they have posted their response form.

e ICL Pathway produce a Non Attendance Report (10.13) (Appendix 13) which
details those outlets invited to the MIB, but have either declined to confirm their
attendance or cancelled their reservation. This will be e-mailed to the RLM team
each Saturday for action on Mondays.

e¢ RLM team will phone the outlet manager (10.14) to:-
¢ ascertain reason for non attendance
e highlight importance of attendance
© encourage attendance

© when the outlet manager agrees attendance they should be advised to contact the
TAC (10.15) to arrange a suitable venue and time. RLM team complete the
Exceptions report and return it to ICL Pathway ROHD via e-mail, retaining a copy
for their files.

e Ifagreement to attend is not achieved then the issue is to be escalated to the RNM
(10.18) who will contact/visit the office to encourage attendance. Outlet managers

MIB non attendance letter to encourage outlet managers to read MIB pack

Dear
Horizon Implementation Process

I understand that you were unable to attend your important Horizon Management
Infrastructure Briefing. This means that you have missed your opportunity to learn,
face to face, about the Horizon implementation process, how it affects your outlet, and
the important role that you play in the process.

As it is important that you understand how the Horizon implementation will affect
you, ICL Pathway will send a briefing pack direct to you at your outlet. It is important
that you take the time to read this pack and make sure you understand:

e what you need to think about before we survey your outlet;
e how you can help during the survey;

e that you will need to agree a layout plan during the survey to accommodate the
Horizon equipment at your outlet;

This survey will take place within the next few weeks. ICL Pathway will be contacting
you soon to make the necessary arrangements. Please make every effort to be
available for this survey once agreed. Remember that this is the largest project of this
kind in Europe and ICL Pathway will be arranging hundreds of surveys each week
during the rollout of the Horizon system. Whilst they will make every effort to fit in
with your wishes, you will need to be flexible and then carry out what you have
agreed.

If you have not received the briefing pack a week before your survey, please contact
the ICL Pathway Training Helpdesk on 0345 413036. If there is anything you do not
understand in the pack, please give your Regional Liaison team a call on 0345
223344.

Yours sincerely,

Horizon Implementation Process

J understand that you were unable to attend your important Horizon User Awareness
Event. This means that you have missed your opportunity to learn, face to face, about
the Horizon installation process, how it affects your outlet, and the important role that
you play in the process.

As it is important that you understand how the Horizon installation will affect you,
ICL Pathway will send a briefing pack direct to you at your outlet. It is important that
you take the time to read this pack and make sure you understand.

that training is mandatory for you and your staff. You will soon be receiving a
form to request places for you and your staff on a training course. The courses are
planned over the 5 days prior to installation.

e that BT will be contacting you to install the ISDN line, the communications link
for Horizon.

e what you need to think about before we install the equipment

e that any work you have agreed to carry out at the survey is completed prior to
installation.

Installation will take place within the next few weeks. ICL Pathway will be contacting
you soon to make the necessary arrangements. Please make every effort to be
available for the installation once agreed. Remember that this is the largest project of
this kind in Europe and ICL Pathway will be arranging hundreds of installations each
week during the rollout of the Horizon system. Whilst they will make every effort to
fit in with your wishes, you will need to be flexible and then carry out what you have
agreed.

If you have not received the briefing pack a week before your installation, please
contact the ICL Pathway Training Helpdesk on 0345 413036. If there is anything you
do not understand in the pack, please give your Regional Liaison team a call on 0345

Clarification of Subpostmasters Position Re Horizon Meeting

As a result of the forthcoming inclusion of X SPSO into the Horizon installation
programme, the subpostmaster, Title & Name received an invitation to attend for the
required training.

Title & Name having indicated that he/she does not intend to attend the required
training event arranged by ICL Pathway nor any reasonable alternative event that can
be offered, this meeting was convened by Title & Name, RNM, to clarify the
subpostmasters position and seek a way forward.

At the conclusion of the meeting, we can confirm the following:-

1. The reasons for the subpostmasters refusal to attend training have been fully
discussed, including any fears about and any physical barriers to, the attendance at
the event offered or reasonable alternatives.

2. That the RNM has explained the reasons for the automation of its Network by
POCL and why it cannot and will not allow any exceptions to the automation
programme.

3. That the RNM has fully explained to the subpostmaster his/her contractual
position with POCL. This included clarification that refusal to attend for training
is considered a breach by the subpostmaster of his/her contract for services by
POCL.

4. That the subpostmaster has been made aware of the consequences of continued
tefusal to attend for training, or any other hindrance to the automation programme.
That he/she understands that POCL will take action as a result which may include
possible termination of contract.

Subpostmaster Date RNM

As a result of this meeting I confirm the following:-

1. * J will now attend a training event for the Horizon automation system when
offered. Furthermore, I will co-operate fully with POCL in the automation of
my office.

2. * do not wish to attend a training event for Horizon and request my outlet be

removed from the Horizon programme. I understand that POCL will take any
action it considers necessary as a consequence of my decision.

(Letter to outlet manager - staff non attendance on day of training)

Dear

J understand that a member of your staff name did not attend their Horizon training
on date. Horizon training is mandatory and every attempt should be made to ensure
that your staff receive training from ICL Pathway. This training is available up to and
including the day after your installation.

Please phone the ICL Pathway Training Helpdesk on 0345 413036 to make alternative
arrangements. The installation at your outlet may be delayed whilst your staff are
trained - this should be avoided at all costs.

Should name be unable to attend the ICL Pathway training prior to go live, then it is

your responsibility to ensure that your staff are trained to the required standard, before
they can be allowed to use the Horizon system.

Yours sincerely,

Regional Liaison Manager

Dear

I understand that following the ICL Pathway Horizon Training, name has not obtained
the Horizon Achievement Certificate.

As there are enter number staff from your outlet already trained to the required
standard then the installation at your outlet is unaffected and is confirmed for enter
date.

It is now your responsibility to provide further training for name to ensure that he/she

achieves the required standard prior to working on your counter.
