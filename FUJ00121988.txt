I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account, formally ICL Pathway Ltd.,
since the 22" September 2003 as Security Manager where I am responsible for IT Security
and the Audit Retrieval Query service. I have working knowledge of the computer system
known as Horizon, which is a computerised accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. 1am
authorised by Fujitsu Services to undertake and supervise extractions of audit data held on the
Horizon system and to obtain information regarding system transaction information processed
on the Horizon system.

Further to the statements submitted by Beatrice Neneh Lowther and Penelope Anne Thomas
regarding extraction of data for ARQ’s 198, 199 and 200 relating to Forest Gate Post Office,
FAD Code 100002. I confirmed that at Fujitsu Services, Forest Road, Feltham, TW13 7EJ
between the 25" and the 28"" May 2004 I carried out a comparison of the Forest Gate ARQ
data as extracted by Beatrice Neneh Lowther and forwarded to Post Office Limited as Exhibits
NL/1B, NL/2B and NL/3B and the Forest Gate ARQ as extracted by Penelope Anne Thomas
and submitted to Post Office Limited on the 27" May 2004 as Exhibit PT/02. The recreation of
the data and the check was due to Beatrice Neneh Lowther’s absence on maternity leave and
the possibility of a witness being required to attend a planned court date.

These comparison checks revealed the following omissions in the data provide by Beatrice
Neneh Lowther as Exhibits NL/1B, NL/2B and NL/3B. This request is split over 3 ARQ, No's
198, 199 & 200 as follows.

Continuation of statement of William Leslie Mitchell

ARQ 198 — The ARQ covers the period 14/10/02 to 13/11/2002, totalling 31 query days. The
root cause for the omission of data from this ARQ is that the retrieval was executed as a single
task with the resultant data retrieval exceeding the available 100Gb limit of the Message Store
area on the Audit Server. This forced the Audit Server to randomly drop 11,135 data entries. A

total of 10 days were affected these dates are:

16/10 — Partial, no end of day
17/10 — Partial, no end of day
19/10 — No data retrieved.

21/10 — Partial, no end of day
22/10 — Partial, no end of day
23/10 — Partial, no end of day
25/10 — Partial, no end of day
26/10 — No data retrieved

29/10 — No data retrieved

30/10 — Partial, no end of day

ARQ 199: The ARQ covers the period 14/11/02 to 11/12/2002, totalling 28 query days. The
root cause for the omission of data from this ARQ is when an ARQ is retrieved it is necessary to
add additional days to the end of the requested date span to ensure a full and complete capture
of the data which may have been harvested at different times. The operator should then
confirm that an end of day log off is present and extract only the required data files. In this
case the operator added two additional days to each ARQ, which is normally sufficient, but it
appears did not confirm that an end of day log off was present, consequently an additional 235
data entries were not included in the data extraction. The affected date was 27/11/2002 —

Partial, no end of day.

ARQ 200: The ARQ covers the period 12/12/2002 to 08/01/2003, totalling 28 query days. The
root cause for the omission of data from this ARQ was the same as ARQ 199 above and 679

additional data entries were not included in the data extraction. The affected date was
03/01/2003 — Partial, no end of day.

All records to which I refer in my statement form part of the records relating to the business of
Fujitsu Services. These were compiled during the ordinary course of business from information
supplied by persons who have or may reasonably be supposed to have personal knowledge of
the matter dealt with in the information supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of the
information or cannot be traced. As part of my duties, I have access to these records. Having
reviewed both sets of data I have confirmed that the omissions made within the data provided
by Beatrice Neneh Lowther have not been repeated in the ARQ data provided by Penelope
Anne Thomas as Exhibit PT/02 and that the data is complete in accordance with the original
ARQ.
