To Colin Burston Contracts Advisor. Paul Dann Former Subpostmaster Account
From Judy Balderson FSA
Date 17 January 2011

Subject Howey 158644

As you are aware the Subpostmaster (Mr Bailey) of the above branch was suspended
on 5/1/11 following a large audit shortage. The branch operates an outreach service
using luggable kit. Branch code 223644 At the time of the audit at Howey the
luggable kit was not working (confirmed with engineer on site). Consequently I
returned to the branch on 17/1/11 to complete an audit of the outreach branch.

The result of the audit at the outreach was a surplus of £42.18 pence (£41.21 in cash
and 97p in postage). In addition on accessing Howey a credit transactional correction
for £45.00 was on site which was accepted. making the total surplus £87.18. This
surplus was transferred to the late account to be offset against the audit shortage.

A final account was prepared and despatched.

The branch was defunded and all cash and stock returned to the distribution centre. I
gave Mr Bailey the safe keys as it was now empty and retained the datestamps.

Both Mr and Mrs Bailey were on site during the audit. They seemed to be under the
impression that the audit shortage would reappear somewhere in the paperwork and
all would be well. I explained very clearly that even if the money did come back,
there would still be the issue of inflating the cash on hand figure to cover the
shortage.
