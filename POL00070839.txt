Subject: Post Office Limited -v- Mr L Castleton

Dear Mr Ward,

As you know, we act on behaif of the Post Office in relation to the above matter. In summary,
the dispute is as follows:

(1) The dispute

Lee Castleton was a Sub-Postmaster at the Marine Drive branch 18 July 2003 to 23 March
2004. His Contract for services states that he is strictly responsible for the safe custody of cash
and stock, obliged to make good all losses caused through his own negligence, carelessness or
error and losses of any kind caused by his assistants and that his responsibility does not cease
when he relinquished his appointment and that he remains obliged to make good any losses
incurred during his term of office which subsequently came to light.

Between 18 July 2003 and 25 March 2004, net losses of £27,115.83 occurred at the Marine
Drive branch. Castleton‘s case is that any shortfall is entirely the fault of problems with the
Horizon computer and accounting system at Marine Drive branch and that the P.O wrongfully
terminated his Contract in respect of which he has suffered loss not exceeding £250,000.

(2) Witness Statements and Fujitsu

We have to serve Witness Statements by no later than 14 July 2006. I understand that you
have been having a frustrating time trying to get anything meaningful from Fujitsu. We have an
email from Andrew Price at NBSC to Cath Oglesby (P.O.) stating that Andrew Wise at NBSC
had been unable to find any errors with the system. We also have an email from Julie Welsh
Service Delivery Manager, HSH which stated that there was no evidence of any system
problems, (Copies of these documents are attached). To make life easy for Fujitsu, 1 would like
to arrange a date to visit Julie Welsh and Andrew Wise to take Proofs of Evidence from them. I
will then draft their Witness Statements based upon the evidence they give to me.

House, 35 Broadway, Manchester, M5 6YY. Tel

Julie Welsh is based at Fujitsu Services, Lovelace Road, Bracknell, Berkshire, RG12
8SM. Telephone number:
Mobile Number:

I propose to contact Andrew Wise and Julie Welsh directly to arrange dates to visit them and
take proofs of evidence. Ideally the meetings would take place between between around 22
May and 9 June. It may also be helpful for you to attend, Are you available around that time?
I am also copying in Ian Herbert of Hugh James to this email. Ian is dealing with two similar
claims that may be brought against the Post Office by other Sub-Postmasters (by Bajaj and
Bilku) in relation to Horizon issues, Ian will probably also attend. (Ian, please also let me have
your availability).

Secondly, is there a "techy" person that you can identify at Fujitsu, that will have an intimate
kne — :dge of the Horizon System and be able to explain how it works and capability etc, who I
coulu also interview at the same time as Julie Welsh?

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Kind regards.
