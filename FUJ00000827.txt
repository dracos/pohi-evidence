EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF IMPACT ASSESSMENTS:

By letter (the “Letter”) dated 29 September 2000 from Keith Baines to Tony
Oppenheim, POCL asserted that it had acquired the right to terminate the Codified
Agreement between the parties dated 28 July 1999 (the “Codified Agreement”) on
the basis that Pathway had failed to meet certain Service Levels referred to in the
Letter for three Service Level Measurement Periods in a 24 month period.

Whilst reserving its position under the Codified Agreement in respect of that and all
other rights to terminate asserted by POCL, Pathway has entered negotiations and
workshops with POCL and has taken steps to address the issues raised in the
Letter.

The full package of measures to address the issues raised in the Letter is not yet
agreed between the parties. As part of the package of measures and amendments
to be introduced, the parties have agreed variations to the SLAs concerning the
answering of calls to the Help Desk set out in Schedules A15, A16 and G10 of the
Codified Agreement.

To clarify the Service Level basis for the introduction of “Network Banking” the
parties agree, on the terms set out in this CCN, to give affect to the agreed Service
Level variations relating to the answering of calls by the Help Desk, notwithstanding
that the overall package of measures and amendments to be introduced to the
Codified Agreement remains to be agreed.

OVERALL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: HIGH--MEDIUM / LOW

REASON FOR CHANGE:
Partial resolution of issues raised in the Letter and variation of Service Level
provisions.
