They would have seen different figures on different counters, and would not necessarily have realised they had processed the
transfer twice.

| would not be happy to blame any resulting problem on the branch not following procedure.

I’ve found a long email chain from 2006 which I’ve attached, and three calls raised by the branch for the original problem:
PC0126042, PCO126376, PCO127246

Having looked at these, | slightly disagree with Gareth’s description of the problem below. My wording would be

2. It manifested itself by the Receiving Stock Unit not being able to “see” that the Transfer made by the “sending” Stock Unit
had already been accepted in, and compounded by accepting it again. Other transactions might have been omitted from the
balance but would have been included in the following week's balance instead.

But this is all a very long time ago and it is hard to be entirely accurate. Not helped by the various spellings of Callender/dar etc!

Thanks Anne

| assume from this answer that if the branches followed correct procedure there would be no balancing issues?

Pete,

| have found a summary of the problem that Gareth produced when preparing evidence for a court case in 2010. | have made a few
amendments to make it more generally applicable.

1. The problem occurred when transferring Cash or Stock between Stock Units.
It manifested itself by the Receiving Stock Unit not being able to “see” the Transfer made by the “sending” Stock Unit and
could be compounded by attempting to make a further transfer. Note that such transactions usually reappeared the next
day.

3. It was clearly visible to the User as a “Receipts and Payments mismatch” at the time that one of the Stock Units was
Balanced.

4. The problem was also visible when looking at system events associated with the Branch.

5. The problem was fixed in the S90 Release which went live in March 2006.

Receipts and payments mismatches normally showed up on one of the reconciliation reports and would have been investigated
and reported to Post Office at the time (though of course we don’t know what action they took).

Pete,

As | said on the phone, the ‘Callender Square’ problem was a Horizon issue, not HNG-X (the Castleton trial was at the end of 2006,
long before HNG-X went live).

| have various emails relating to this, though haven’t so far found a concise summary. A fix was applied in March 2006. However
FUJ00083775
FUJ00083775

this problem, when it occurred, caused repeated NT events. When data is retrieved for audit requests, SSC check for these specific
NT events and whether the branch could have been affected by this problem.

Anne.

Hi Anne

Post Office have asked us to confirm the following which I have extracted from Anne Chambers evidence in the
Castleton trial relates to one of the two disclosed bugs in HNGX:

“She immediately recognized the branch with confidence as being a branch at Callendar Square in Falkirk. The
problem at Callender Square had, she said,

arisen from an error in the Horizon system, but there was no evidence of such a thing at Mr. Castleton's branch. I
found Mrs. Chambers to be a clear, knowledgeable and reliable witness, and I accept her evidence.’

Thanks

Pete

Hi Pete, Thank you for the below.
In terms of the TFS — is the attached the TFS call for the 2010 incident?

In terms of the third bug — this was said to have occurred at the Callender Square Branch in Falkirk, so! presume it does exist — not
least because it was reference in two separate court procedures? Could you do some digging please?

| believe you are at PO today so if easier, happy to speak in person

Hi
Updated status in blue below:

Following our conversation yesterday these are the “asks” of Fujitsu which we are currently working on:

¢ Can Fujitsu provide photographs of the area in Bracknell Mr Rudkin visited? - Attached

e Can Fujitsu accommodate a visit by Angela Van Den Bogard to this area next week? — Post Office to offer availability
Completed

e Would Fujitsu approve a Panorama film crew the opportunity to film in the test area in Bracknell? For the reasons
discussed yesterday Fujitsu have decided not to take up this offer.

e Provide TFS outputs and supportive documentation for the 2 bugs identified in the Second Sight Report Detailed
information attached. Still trying to find some example TFS calls related to the two bugs.

* Investigate the suggestion there is a 3" bug in the Second Sight Report- Mark Underwood has sent over the email with the
detail. Fujitsu can confirm there have only been 2 bugs.

« — Fujitsu to soften words as discussed on the statement to be issued to Panorama’s ROR. Statement submitted and agreed
Will be submitted to Panorama as appropriate

Regards

Pete
