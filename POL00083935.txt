Action Points from 21 August 2013

1 The minutes of the meeting were circulated by AP in advance of this week's telephone
conference.
2 A telephone conference took place between AP, the Security team and JS1 Singh re action point

list. Confirming that Matrix drafted.

3 SB2 copying JS1 and RW into all emails regarding new MP cases, reporting and relaying
information regarding queries by MP's to Rosie Gaisford (RG) of Bond Dickinson. SB2 is also
liaising with RG on any new cases that arise.

4 JS1 and MS discussed what further information is needed on Wincor ATM theft issues. MS
currently trying to establish what existing/past cases have been covered. MS liaising with Helen
Dickinson (HD) and making further enquiries.

RK stating that Wincor can provide details of all sites and that they are currently cross
referencing this with all investigations. MS/RK to update on this.

JS2 stating that Security having a meeting with the police this week. Police taking an interest as
it appears to be an industry wide problem - £250K.

5 Rhigos branch — GP updating, £24K cost to which Angela is investigating further under the case
review. GP suggesting to RW to put in mediation as SPM refusing to interview. RW agreeing.

6 E-top up issues — AW still investigating and stating that recovery document going out (which had
already been planned) with suggested wording to cover the scenario. AW still uncomfortable with
this.

GP stating to hang fire, need to discuss steps of top-up where there is a communication failure; it
is unclear what should happen. Need a clear answer form Fujitsu before recovery document
sent.

JS2 — asking for clarification on the issue and whether there was any impact on prosecution
cases. GP - noting that issues are conflicting advice around error messages and that we should
be clear internally before updating as it has a financial impact on branch. Example provided: If

customer asks for £10 top-up and the transaction is initially declined, the SPM would process
again. When SPM goes to settle the 2"? completed top-up and connection is lost, Horizon
recovers the first failed top up. Post recovery it should account for two top-ups but only accounts
for one.

AW has never come across this before — very rare/ requires extraordinary circumstances.

MS noting that could have impact on prosecution - important that this is flagged up to address —
con calls do this.

GP/AW/ RW to discuss offline as too technical over conference. GP to liaise with Steve Beddoe
(SB1) and SB1 to lead on this matter.

Process for communicating between teams when a prosecution is withdrawn — JS1 to copy
Communications team into decision making process. Where there is anything of concern
Network & Security team are to be copied in and the Communications team will get a summary.
Agreed Public Affairs will also be copied into to any correspondence as aware MP now involved.
JS1 will formalise the process for communication with Communications team.

NB — Conscious not covering enough people in Network team and that we should also keep

Contracts team up to date. NB to call JS1 to discuss further.

Rodric Williams Legal 1. Horizon Integrity related — Fujitsu want to migrate

(RW) transaction data to new servers. Initially thought
transaction data untouchable, but not. There are risks of
data corruption/loss of integrity with transaction data
migration. Fujitsu are currently working a new proposal
for this and Dave King (DK) investigating criminal
prosecutions/ civil recovery. IT to re-scope and get risk
analysis on this. If data needs to be migrated — need
someone to independently audit process. No time limit but
Fujitsu want to get things moving as soon as possible. RW
noting that timing unfortunate and that Fujitsu were
currently working on risks/benefits for POL. JS2
concluding: NOT AN ACTION FOR THIS GROUP.

2. ATM Issue — Affects branch balancing. New routers in

ATM in Jan — issues with withdrawals not being captured.
Currently in touch with 50 branches to see if any branch
issues. Product team are to investigate further. RW to
email GP on this issue - NEW HORIZON ACTION.
