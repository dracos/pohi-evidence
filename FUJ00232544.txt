1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 PURPOSE

This document details the Service Level Targets (SLTs) contracted to by Fujitsu Services in relation to the agreed
service levels and performance metrics as described in Schedule 15 of The Agreement. Furthermore this
document identifies those service levels targets which have an associated Liquidated Damage Threshold and/or
Additional Remedy Level

1.2 SCOPE

The scope of these SLTs is limited to those Service Levels and performance metrics described in Schedule 15 in
relation to the Horizon Services and any other Service Levels which may be introduced via the Contract Change
Procedure from time to time.

1.3 CONTRACTUAL PRECEDENCE

The description in the service requirement column is in abbreviated form and is for identification purposes only.

In the event of conflict or inconsistency, Schedule 15 shall have contractual precedence over the table in section 2
of this document in respect of the description in the service requirement column and the column indicating a
related LDT and or ARL.

In respect of the service level descriptions in this document, the actual Service Level Targets shall always be as

stated in the service level target column in section 2 of the latest authorised version of this document as recorded
in the CCD entitled “Contract Controlled and Referenced Document” (BP/SPE/026).

1.4 OBJECTIVES

The main objective of the SLTs is to assure the overall performance of the Horizon Services as they impact upon
the business at post office Branches and the services provided to clients of Post Office Ltd.

1.5 PERFORMANCE MONITORING

Unless stated otherwise in the table in section 2 of this document, performance against these SLTs will be
regularly monitored by Fujitsu Services and reported monthly to Post Office Ltd in the service review book as
described in Schedule 19 of The Agreement.

1.6 SERVICE LEVEL TARGET MAINTENANCE

For the avoidance of doubt, any changes to the SLTs or performance metrics stated in this document may be
agreed through the Soft Change Control Procedure. Changes to the actual service requirement must be agreed
through the Hard Change Control Procedure as these service requirements are detailed within Schedule 15 of the
Agreement.
