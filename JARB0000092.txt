Post Office telephone conversation
28 October 2014

Possible items that will arise

1. Second Sight reports
a. Report into individual cases
b. Part 2 report — discusses thematic issues. Post Office responded to this report
pretty much refuting everything Second Sight claimed to have unearthed or
state that the areas Second Sight have commented on are ‘no go’ — areas
beyond Second Sight's remit / expertise. This Report is a work in progress
and Second Sight continue to develop it as they investigate cases.

2. Working group procedures
a. We know Alan and Kay have stopped attending the section of meetings
where individual cases are discussed — they argue that it is NOT for the
working group to sit in judgment on individual cases. Second Sight were to
investigate and made recommendation as to whether cases proceed to
mediation; this discussed at working group NOT argued legally and at length.
Spirit of mediation process appears to have broken down.

3. Jo Hamilton
a. Has been told that her case will not proceed any further until ALL cases have
been investigated. Why not?

4. Other MPs getting worried about all this
JNA office contacted by (among others): George Osborne, Jim Hood, Bob Blackburn,
Priti Patel, Steve Webb

5. Media want to talk to James now

6. Meeting request of 4 September — to Paula, asking for meeting with James and Jim
Hood — no response yet
