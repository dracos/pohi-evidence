James
Thanks to you and the team for coming in this afternoon.
As discussed just now, I’m copying Al so you can email him on the follow ups to our meeting which are:

* Conflict clearance

¢ Meeting with your senior associate Tom Henderson

* Confirmation that he and the rest of your team have the time to commit to this project fully

¢ An indicative timeline over the next few weeks so we can be ready to receive your advice and
recommendations, take the decisions required as a Board and brief Ministers

* A fee indication that incentivises you to reach a conclusion to the litigation in a cost effective
way and in a reasonable timeframe

Please feel free to deal with these one by one in the interests of speed.

Your primary point of contact for this should be Al and he will confirm your appointment as soon as the
follow-ups have been dealt with and terms agreed. Tim is also aligning the rest of the Board at our end.

Assuming everything can be finalised satisfactorily, we’re looking forward to working with you.

Tom
