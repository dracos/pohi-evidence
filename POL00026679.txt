8. Any other queries raised by Applicants / Advisors

¢ Joint correspondence from Aver and Howe & Co received 28 August.

ACTION

ACTION

Howe and Co have declined to set agree any mediation dates until the issues raised in their
correspondence have been addressed. This has resulting in an urgent need to resolve the
matter as in the case of M006, the applicant is facing two separate court proceedings which are
adjourned pending mediation. WG agreed that the issue of mediation dates was for the parties
to resolve. However given the problem with M006 it was necessary for the WG to reply to the
wider points raised in the correspondence.

The WG agreed that it is for SS to determine whether Part Two of the Mediator’s Briefing Pack
should be sent out to parties and their advisors with their CRR.

The WG discussed the suggestion of splitting mediation in two parts. The WG confirmed that it
will not interfere with the mediation process for those cases that have already moved through to
CEDR. For those cases yet to move to CEDR, the WG will discuss this at the next face-to-face
WG meeting on 16 September.

The WG agreed that where extra time is required for responding to CRRs — such an extension
should be requested before the deadline has expired.

: SAH to reply to Aver and Howe & Co outlining the WG’s position on these points.

: Secretariat to add the joint correspondence between Aver and Howe & Co to the face-to-

face WG meeting agenda for 16 September.

« Email from Steve Darlington sent on 29 August.

ACTION

ACTION

The WG agreed that restricting PO from contacting applicants was outside of the WG’s and was
not prepared to make such a recommendation — but agreed that it would be discussed further at
the next face-to-face WG meeting on 16 September.

The WG discussed Howe & Co’s concerns about Part Two of the Mediator’s Briefing Pack. The

WG confirmed that they were not prepared to put the decision of whether or not a case should
be mediated on hold pending finalisation of Part two.

: SAH to reply to Howe & Co outlining the WG’s position on these points.

: Secretariat to add Steve Darlington’s email to the face-to-face WG meeting agenda for 16

September.
