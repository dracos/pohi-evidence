Deo Mr. Bates,

Thank you for your letter of 16 April to Jo Swinson MP, about the Initial Case Review and
Mediation Scheme. I am the Minister responsible for Post Office policy, while Jo Swinson
takes maternity leave.

The Government is supportive of the desire to resolve the issues raised by subpostmasters in
a timely manner, however, as shareholder, Government cannot be involved in operational
matters concerning Post Office Ltd or the Working Group.

Clearly the matters you raise are important and I understand your desire for them to be
addressed but it is important that they are addressed by the appropriate parties.

Paula Vennells, as Chief Executive of Post Office Ltd, is responsible for operational matters
relating to the company; and the Scheme, which is overseen by the Working Group comprising
representatives from the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance, Post Office Ltd, and Second
Sight, has an independent Chair in Sir Anthony Hooper. As a member of the Working Group I
am sure you will understand that the Chair must be allowed to perform his duties
independently and free from influence.

Given the matters you raise relate to the operation of the Working Group, and also about the
engagement of Post Office Ltd with the Scheme I intend to forward a copy of your letter to both
Sir Anthony Hooper and Paula Vennells so that they can make informed responses to the

issues that you have raised. If you have any objections to my doing so, please let me know by
Wednesday 30 April.

JENNY WILLOTT MP
