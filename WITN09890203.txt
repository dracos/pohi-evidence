Dear Mr Wallis,
Freedom of Information Request — FOI2020/00186

Iam writing in response to your letter received by Post Office Limited (“Post Office”)
on 9 April 2020, which I am dealing with under the terms of the Freedom of
Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”).

Your request was as follows:

“Please supply, by year, the number of prosecutions of:

a) Subpostmasters,
b) their assistants or
c) Post Office workers (eg those in Crown Post Offices)

brought by the Post Office/Royal Mail since 1990.

Please ALSO supply, by year, the number of criminal convictions which
resulted from these prosecutions”.

We do not hold all of the information which pertains to your request. The information
we do hold is set out in the table below. However, this data is likely to be incomplete
and therefore should be treated with caution, for the following reasons:

1. The table below is based solely on information held by Post Office Limited, and
does not therefore reflect information (if any) that may be held by Royal Mail, to
which your request also refers.

2. The request covers a very lengthy period of time extending back 30 years.

3. Data relating to convictions between 1991-2006 in particular has been compiled
from extremely limited available material.

4. The table excludes cases where the data held by Post Office is inconclusive as to
whether the prosecution was brought by any other organisation, or whether it
resulted in a conviction.

In addition, although you have asked for information on both prosecutions and
convictions, the table contains information on convictions only. This is because Post
Office does not hold a sufficiently complete set of data for prosecutions which did not
result in a conviction, again reflecting the length and aged period of the request.

The below table sets out the number of prosecutions brought for which we hold records
and have been able to determine that there was a conviction. To date, we have been
unable to locate any records before 1991. There are 104 cases where Post Office holds
information recording that the defendant was convicted, but not the date of that
conviction, for which the year has been listed as “Unknown”.

In accordance with its duties as former prosecutor, Post Office is conducting a post-
conviction disclosure exercise to identify and disclose material in all historical cases
relating to Horizon data, not just those reviewed by the CCRC, that might cast doubt on

the safety of convictions. Some of the convictions referred to in the table above from
1999 onwards will be within the scope of this exercise.

We continue to make full disclosure of documents to the CCRC and will be, similarly,
assisting the appeal courts regarding the cases that have now been referred to them.

I hope the information I have been able to provide on this occasion is useful, however
if you are dissatisfied with the handling of this response, you do have a right to
request an internal review. You can do this by writing to the address below stating
your reasons for your internal review request.
