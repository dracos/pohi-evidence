Carl Page: Yes.

(TC: 00:02:14)
Manish Patel: Okay. um, if I, if I pretty much stick to the bureau de change type of transactions.

complete a transaction if it, if you like, from the very beginning of the morning. i.e. the fax that
comes in (talking over each other 02.41).

(TC: 00:02:40)

Carl Page: First job is the look at the rates, go check the rates, put them in, um, slightly go because in the
co-op, in the town, they're slightly better than the Post Office. If they' re better, I'll slightly up it a bit if
not, I leave it as it is.

(TC: 00:02:56)
Manish Patel: Okay. Let's just break that down a little bit.

(TC: 00:02:59)

appointment cause of Gemma, he needs nice transactions and he says we can get a better rate is it okay to

(TC: 00:07:04)
Manish Patel: So, you don't, but you don't own the cash right? and therefore because you don't
own the cash you don't use it for your own purposes do you?

(TC: 00:07:11)
Carl Page: No.

(TC: 00:07:11)
Manish Patel: Right. You don't set the exchange rate do you?

(TC: 00:07:16)
Nigel Pepper: Well, if we' re asking about facts and evidence here, he's just telling you that he does.

(TC: 00:07:25)
Manish Patel: No, err, sorry let me rephrase that. You don't, you don't, you don't set the national
exchange rate do you?

(TC: 00:07:28)
Carl Page: No I don't, I leave it as national exchange rate but only if I know somebody locally you do it
better, you do it slightly better.

(TC: 00:07:36)
Manish Patel: No I don't. I understand that, I fully understand that but, but-, and you've said no.
The point I was making is that you don't set the national-,

(TC: 00:07:44)
Carl Page: No.

(TC: 00:07:44)
Manish Patel: Okay. So, the Post Office has a product which is bureau de change.

(TC: 00:07:51)
Manish Patel: Right. For which we, and I use the term we meaning First Rate as well.

(TC: 00:07:57)
Carl Page: Yes.

(TC: 00:07:57)
Manish Patel: Set a national exchange rate.

(TC: 00:07:57)
Carl Page: Yes.

(TC: 00:07:57)
Manish Patel: And we say this product, which you're acting as our agent to sell, has to be sold at
this rate today. Right, with our money.

(TC: 00:08:07)
Carl Page: Okay.

(TC: 00:08:07)

Manish Patel: So, do you then have the right, just because Joe Bloggs down the road has a
different, better rate, do you have the right to make up a different rate, a preferential rate to attract
more business? Without contradicting Post Office procedures, and possibly committing criminal
offences? Do you have that right?

(TC: 00:08:33)
Carl Page: The only-, no, but if in my defence, if I can turn and say is I'm trying to encourage business
into the Post Office.

(TC: 00:08:38)
Manish Patel: Fully accept that.

(TC: 00:08:40)
Carl Page: And I'm not, um, making my own means out of it, I'm still getting like a transaction and the
Post Office is still turning over a lot of money, they more they turn over I'm worthy of being stepped out

the more they' Il make us a profit.

(TC: 00:08:58)
Manish Patel: Okay.

(TC: 00:08:59)
Carl Page: I'm not, I'm not.

(TC: 00:08:59)

Manish Patel: Okay, let's leave that there for one second, I'll come back to that in a minute but
let's go, let's go, um, slightly different route then. um, the remuneration the Post Office pays you is,
is, is done how? How is that done?

(TC: 00:09:10)
Carl Page: Per transaction.

(TC: 00:09:10)

Manish Patel: Right. Um, so for every transaction from the sale of a first class stamp to conducting
(talking over each other 09.16) a TV license so whatever you get a certain amount for it. I believe
you already mentioned that for bureau transactions you, you, I think it's £1.12.

(TC: 00:09:28)
Carl Page: £1.12 it's one pound something, it's one pound something or £1.15 off the top of my head.

(TC: 00:09:28)
Manish Patel: Thereabouts. Per transaction.

(TC: 00:09:40)
Carl Page: Yes.

(TC: 00:09:41)
Manish Patel: Is that-, does that vary depending on the value of the transaction?

(TC: 00:09:44)
Carl Page: No.

13751
POL00066734

Transcribed by Take Note®
www.takenote.co

(TC: 00:09:44)
Manish Patel: So, whether you do a transaction for ten pound or a million pounds you would still
get £1.10 okay.

(TC: 00:09:54)

Carl Page: Is err, can I add that? So, um, regarding Mr-, I was-, I'm still getting £1.10 (TC 00:10:00) but,
um, I'm getting more money into the Post Office so with the valuation I'm doing end of the week I always
think it's going to be larger. It may not be, if I lose the business from it, I'm thinking that the Post Office
is not going to get a bit of money out of it.

(TC: 00:10:16)
Manish Patel: Right, but you yourself, regardless of whether you attracted that business in or not.
With the one transaction, you yourself, financially will only gain £1.12 won't you?

(TC: 00:10:25)
Carl Page: That's correct.

(TC: 00:10:25)
Manish Patel: Yes. So, you're attracting, err, the business for the Post Office to make a profit.

(TC: 00:10:32)
Carl Page: Yes, that's the way I look at it.

(TC: 00:10:35)
Manish Patel: Not you.

(TC: 00:10:34)

Carl Page: I'm still getting £1.10 but the end of the day, the more money I'm turning over is only benefit
to the Post Office plus myself so the, my office is seen as doing well, it's tuning over money. As you
know, you probably will look at the figures, we took the bureau-, we had the bureau from nothing. And
the office were doing six a year to averaging about 150 to 160 a week. Bit slow at the moment' cause
obviously, but last year we did 7,000 something transactions.

(TC: 00:11:03)
Manish Patel: Okay. With these large transactions that you have been doing for:
um, when you do that transaction does it go down as one transaction?

14751
POL00066734

www.takenote.co

(TC: 00:11:13)
Carl Page: Just one transaction.

(TC: 00:11:12)
Manish Patel: It doesn't go down as more than one transaction.

(TC: 00:11:13)
Carl Page: No, one transaction only.

(TC: 00:11:17)
Manish Patel: You're quite certain about this?

(TC: 00:11:16)
Carl Page: Yes.

(TC: 00:11:16)
Manish Patel: Okay. In a typical week then how many transactions for Euro's would the office
perform? Not, not just for; but-,

(TC: 00:11:24)
Carl Page: I'd say a good 80% of it would be.

(TC: 00:11:28)
Manish Patel: In numbers, 100, 200?

(TC: 00:11:28)
Carl Page: If we were doing 150 I'd say between a 100 and 120.

(TC: 00:11:33)
Manish Patel: Right okay. So, it's quite high turnover.

(TC: 00:11:34)
Carl Page: It's quite high turnover yeah.

Carl Page: For when he buys in that amount, yes.

(TC: 00:11:50)
Manish Patel: Right. Do you do it for any other customer?

(TC: 00:11:53)
Carl Page: Um, I do slightly for someone who is coming in a lot, whose gonna come in a do a lot of
money. Up it from say 1.49 to 1.5, or 1.5 to-,

(TC: 00:12:05)
Manish Patel: Right and how would you decide that's what you're going to do? What makes you
decide that's what you're going to do?

(TC: 00:12:07)
Carl Page: See what locally what's going on or if I hear about maybe school parties are going away on
holiday or there's a coach party going off or whatever.

(TC: 00:12:16)
Manish Patel: Okay. But do you, do you accept that regardless of whether you've been told you
can't do it.

(TC: 00:14:19)

Carl Page: Not one person has flagged that up. Right. They're saying well, err, do you know about, err,
money laundering laws, nobody at all has flagged it up. Before Christmas I flagged it up with the
gentleman who runs the M and S to get in touch with me after Christmas because it's ridiculous that the
Post Office is sending spending deliveries. Thirty packs of special deliveries a day why can't he send me
one big book on a Monday and this gentleman who was mostly for! “t who I'm on
impression that everything's hunky dory no problem to pick up on a Monday rather than Post Office send
out special delivery, special delivery, special deliveries for this money.

(TC: 00:14:58)

procedure. um it's done for a reason.

(TC: 00:15:02)

(TC: 00:21:37)
Manish Patel: Yes.

(TC: 00:21:37)

or the day after.

(TC: 00:21:48)
Manish Patel: Sure okay.

(TC: 00:23:13)
Carl Page: Right.

(TC: 00:23:14)

Manish Patel: Right. Whose £40,000 have you given to! Because effectively that's
what you've done by attracting business and giving him preferential rate. You've given him £40,000
more than he was entitled to have.

(TC: 00:23:30)
Nigel Pepper: Sorry that question is based on the premise that somebody else would have bought and
placed an order at that amount.

(TC: 00:23:40)

(TC: 00:23:42)

this. I even, about eighteen months ago when I went over to the police station about something else I said
do you know: s he dodgy or whatever, well we've never heard of him so.

(TC: 00:29:00)
Manish Patel: Right. Okay.

(TC: 00:29:05)

Carl Page: I've had nothing in my head to turn around and say ooh because nobody's mentioned it me. I
mean Jane might have made one in passing I mean not being funny and someone says ooh he's dodgy
ain't he that's the first thing people.

(TC: 00:29:18)

Manish Patel: Okay, you mentioned cheques that's a convenient point to move to a different topic.
Let's talk about cheques for a few moments. um, cheques are taking at the Post Office for a number
of transactions for you yes. And is there a, is there a stipulation as to, um, what, what value of
cheque can be taken for any particular transaction?

(TC: 00:29:42)
Carl Page: I totally don't know.

(TC: 00:29:43)
Manish Patel: Right. So, if, if a person want to buy postage stamps and they present you with a
cheque, can they do so?

(TC: 00:29:52)
Carl Page: As long as there's a, a card yes or it's at my discretion. Reason being because if the cheque
bounces I'm the one who has to put the money in.

(TC: 00:30:00)
Manish Patel: You mentioned the card.

(TC 00:30:00) The cheque guaranteed card.

(TC: 00:30:02)
Manish Patel: That's what I was getting out if you in the first question.

(TC: 00:30:05)
Carl Page: You want to know why

+ hasn't-,

(TC: 00:30:08)
Manish Patel: We'll come onto that. But, normally, I use the term normally, cheques are presented
for transactions in the Post Office up to the value of the cheque guarantee card.

(TC: 00:30:20)
Carl Page: Correct.

(TC: 00:30:22)
Manish Patel: Right are you aware of that?

(TC: 00:30:21)
Carl Page: Yes.

(TC: 00:30:23)
Manish Patel: Right. Is that stated somewhere in an operation manual?

(TC: 00:30:25)

Carl Page: Well, no I just passed that because you' ve got more people coming through the Post Office
and you don't know everyone who comes in the Post Office. You can have more than a hundred pound if
it's regarding to a British Gas or BT-,

(TC: 00:30:38)
Manish Patel: Well, utility bills it's different because you can trace the customer.

(TC: 00:30:44)
Manish Patel: Right okay.

(TC: 00:30:49)
Carl Page: When he first started-,

(TC: 00:30:52)

Manish Patel: Are you allowed, are you allowed to, err, whether you do or not, but are you
actually procedurally allowed to take a cheque for higher than its card value for a bureau
transaction?

(TC: 00:31:03)
Carl Page: As far as I know it's down to, if there's a problem with the cheque and it bounces, it's down to
me.

(TC: 00:31:09)
Manish Patel: Well, yes ultimately, ultimately any losses which are incurred at the office, as you're
the sub postmaster, are down to you.

(TC: 00:31:16)
Carl Page: Yes, that's right then. So, it's then down to my discretion isn't it?

(TC: 00:31:18)
Manish Patel: So, if it's down to your discretion, why don't you, why don't you, knock off a fiver
for every green giro that's presented to you?

(TC: 00:31:28)

Manish Patel: Well, just for £100, why don't you give the customer 95 pound?

(TC: 00:31:34)
Carl Page: Because it's £100.

(TC: 00:31:37)

Manish Patel: Right so why would it be down to your discretion if the Post Office says that, um, for
transactions done by a cheque, you must have a guarantee card and the, the cheque value can only
be up to the guarantee card. If they say that to you and they put that in the operational manual,
how can it lead you to believe it's down to your discretion just because ultimately the loss, if there is
one, is your responsibility.

(TC: 00:31:52)
Carl Page: You're trying to say why am I accepting cheques from this larger man because they might
bounce?

(TC: 00:32:08)
Manish Patel: No.

(TC: 00:32:08)
Carl Page: Well, where are you going because I can't understand where you're coming from.

(TC: 00:32:10)
Manish Patel: I'm saying well, in a way I am, I'm saying why do you take-.

(TC: 00:32:14)

Carl Page: The difference is, the difference is is that there's 6,500, 7,000 people on that side and the
bureaus side is one gentleman whose gradually build up over two years trust, or what I thought was trust,
come in than the public, bearing in mind might have had two or three cheques that bounced over because
the money hasn't transferred or whatever. So, end of the day if you're going to into business, you' ve got to
end of the day, wrongly or rightly it comes down to trust.

(TC: 00:32:41)
Manish Patel: Okay.

(TC: 00:32:42)
Carl Page: And I've never had a problem with any cheques. If I have had a cheque I' ve said oh there's

problem with this. We had a cheque with him, two cheques, he flagged it up before I did.

(TC: 00:32:51)
Manish Patel: Right.

(TC: 00:32:53)

Carl Page: Then he used that to draw on, to draw in some more Euros that came out. And then, cause we
still haven' t had the, cause there enough for the cheque for the cheque could maybe take two or three. So,
when those come through he's going to give me cheque which is nowadays after what's happened today.

(TC: 00:33:11)
Manish Patel: Okay, when he, sorry-,

(TC: 00:33:12)

differentiate those because people that haven't been to the office, um, there's a normal.

(TC: 00:33:46)

Carl Page: We usually go every day, that's down to procedures. The bureau cheques go, when we can do
them, go every day. Sometimes they go end of the week, you know how busy you are. The last couple of
weeks ' cause I' ve only been in the office two or three days haven't we over Christmas period.

(TC: 00:33:58)
Manish Patel: Okay, well.

(TC: 00:33:58)
Carl Page: I go as soon as I can.

(TC: 00:33:58)

Manish Patel: Right. So, confirm for me that you're saying that all transactions that are done on

cheques for bureau transactions-

(TC: 00:34:24)
Carl Page: Sometimes yes.

(TC: 00:34:24)
Manish Patel: Away.

(TC: 00:34:28)
Carl Page: Until Wednesday.

(TC: 00:34:27)
Manish Patel: Because they go at the end of the week.

(TC: 00:34:28)
Carl Page: On Wednesday yes.

(TC: 00:34:28)
Manish Patel: Right would that be correct in her saying that?

(TC: 00:34:30)
Carl Page: Every now and again yes.

(TC: 00:34:31)
Manish Patel: So, you had instructed Jane to not process the bureau transaction cheques until the
end of the week.

(TC: 00:34:41)
Carl Page: Well, um, yes in the past, but lately, I' ve left her to her own because she knows that I went in
and got told off last year by the Post Office but returning things. That I started to do straight away. As
best I can, as in the labour we' ve got there, everything else.

(TC: 00:34:55)

(TC: 00:35:02)
Carl Page: Not recently I don't think.

(TC: 00:35:06)
Manish Patel: Okay. Why do you instruct them, err, for the bureau transactions to not put them
away?

(TC: 00:35:10)
Carl Page: Because put the transactions, I put the transactions in when I balance the office on a
Wednesday.

(TC: 00:35:15)

Manish Patel: But that makes no difference. Cheques, regardless of what transaction they've been
taken in for are meant to be dispatched on a daily basis. The Post Office, you're trying to make
money for the Post Office, is lost interest on £360,000, well I'm using yesterdays cheques, there's
other cheques right? If you had banked that cheque when it was presented, okay..

(TC: 00:35:39)
Carl Page: If you look at when it was presented. Okay, if you look at say, last six months, how often the
cheques have been going in, have you checked that?

(TC: 00:35:42)
Manish Patel: I haven't but I will be.

(TC: 00:35:45)
Carl Page: Yeah. As far as I' m aware that they've been going in as regular as clockwork.

T' ve got to do it. I'm not trying to dishonest any body.

(TC: 00:36:02)

Manish Patel: That's not what your staff are telling me. Your staff is telling me categorically that
you've instructed this one individual, um, that the cheques taken for bureau transactions. And
we're basically talking about the higher value ones from!_ “laren't we? There's isn't
any others.

hasn't been coming in ' til-,

(TC: 00:36:42)

Manish Patel: But that's not what, um, what your staff has just told me, your staff is saying that if
that happens on the Thursday, that cheque, under your instructions, it sits there until Wednesday

(TC: 00:36:57)
Carl Page: It's because I get round to-, well,'m the one, I get round to doing it.

(TC: 00:37:04)

Manish Patel: Okay. So, on the one hand you're taking it upon yourself to boost the business for
the Post Office and therefore make a profit for the Post Office, not you, the Post Office, by
comparing, err, exchange rates with Thomas Cook or whoever down the road and giving a
preferential rate.

(TC: 00:37:20)
Carl Page: Well, because they don't send the cheques out every day.

(TC: 00:37:19)
Manish Patel: To bring in-, to bring in the business and on the other hand you're withholding
submitting a cheque for very large values, £215,000.

(TC: 00:37:32)
Carl Page: You mean deliberately withholding is that what you're trying to say?

(TC: 00:37:30)
Manish Patel: Well, isn't that what you're doing? Why do you send all the other cheques away?

(TC: 00:37:36)
Carl Page: 'Cause I tend to the bureau balance on a Wednesday evening.

the, um, thinking behind what Mr Page has been doing.

Carl Page: So, you're saying I' ve got intent to physically hold the cheques back for some reason or other.

(TC: 00:38:21)

find time but then if you don't find time, how do you find time to send the other err, and there
might be 50 cheques.

or Tuesday.

(TC: 00:38:55)
Manish Patel: Okay.

(TC: 00:38:55)

Manish Patel: Okay. So, they allow, or they make special conditions for any customer whose
purchasing in excess of £5, 000 sterling of any currency? Or is it particular types? Or is it mainly
just Dollars?

(TC: 00:40:25)
Carl Page: As far as I-, it might be Euros or Dollars.

writing on the fax that if a customer comes in for, um, a transaction for over £5, 000 we'll give them
a better rate. Right. Does that not go in some way to saying, err, to you, it may not be written down
