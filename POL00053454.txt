Memo

2" November 2009
Post Office Seourity

¢.c. Jon Longman

Jon,

You will recall that Warwick Tatford asked me to arrange for Counsel to visit the
Office on Friday 6" November. I understand that Counsel no longer wishes to
view the Office but Defence Solicitor and the Expert still wish to do so and I
think it would be better if I could perhaps try and re-arrange this appointment
for the 6” November instead of the 13" November in order to keep things
moving along. If there is to be a change in the date the Expert wishes to come I
will let you know.

Jarnail has received a call from Warwick Tatford who, as I understand it,
requires a statement to be taken from someone ie yourself dealing with those
cases that are in that set of papers from the Defence dealing with various other
cases to do with Horizon. I am not quite sure what Counsel requires as I have
only heard it second hand but it appears that he wants a statement covering
other cases, where there was a guilty plea or guilty verdict etc. I will E-Mail
Warwick Tatford and find out exactly what he requires and it may be better that
he talks to you direct.

Best wishes.

Phil Taylor
