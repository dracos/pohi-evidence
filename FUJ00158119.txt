APPENDIX D
Databases of Electronic Documents
FUJITSU DATABASES
Fujitsu provides a range of IT services to Post Office in relation to the Horizon system throughout the relevant period. As a result, there are a significant number

of documents within Fujitsu's control which may be relevant. Whilst many of these documents are not within Post Office's control and therefore do not fall to be
disclosed by it, in the interests of assisting the Court, Post Office sets out below a high level overview of:

. the locations of documents held by Fujitsu that are potentially relevant to the Claim;
. the types of document held by Fujitsu that are potentially relevant to the Claim; and
. comments regarding the ease and proportionality of disclosure and the likely relevance and limitations of the documents.

This information has been provided by Fujitsu to Post Office.

Document type / Database Nature of data held Comments

Known Error Log (KEL) The KEL is a proprietary database with approximately The KEL only contains the current database entries and is constantly

issues that can sometimes arise in Horizon'for which versions of the current entries are no longer available.

(often because of their triviality) system-wide fixes have

not been developed and implemented. The KEL cannot be easily downloaded as it is stored on a database.

Even then, unless one has the necessary database software,
reading the data in the KEL is difficult. The alternative is to manually,
copy or print each entry, but this would produce poorly formatted
material and would take significant effort.

In light of this, the Claimant's IT expert has inspected the KEL at

Fujitsu's offices.

ML4 Yes, though a small number of the very old documents that have been asked for already (199x-2001) were received as paper only and
not scanned, but I believe these are non-Fujitsu documents. We can attempt to locate these in hard copy archive or suggest which other
parties to ask.

documents has been provided to the Claimant's solicitors.

Peak System

If Fujitsu identifies an issue in Horizon that requires a
programmatic fix then it is logged in its database, the
Peak System, and labelled as a ‘Peak’.

If Fujitsu identifies an issue in Horizon that requires a
programmatic fix then it is logged in its database, the Peak System,
and labelled as a ‘Peak’.

TFS and Powerhelp

Post Office and its agents have access to a help desk
called Horizon Service Desk (HSD) to manage technical
issues with Horizon — HSD was provided by Fujitsu prior to
June 2014 (and has been provided by ATOS since that
date).

Between 2001 and September 2009, Fujitsu used
Powerhelp to log calls. From September 2009 onwards,
Fujitsu used Team Foundation Server (TFS), a proprietary
database, to log calls made to HSD.

TFS call logs date back to September 2009. These call logs could
xtracted from TFS into an Excel document [confirm with Fd}

owerhelp may contain call logs for the period between 2001 an
September 2009, however, Fujitsu has advised that the Powerhelp
servers are still stored but they do not currently have the means to
access them; they would have to recreate a ring fenced network
running Windows 2003 (the redundant software on which PowerhelpI
was run).

SharePoint and shared drives
Projectweb

SharePoint has been used by Fujitsu since c.2008 to store
and share documents it produces relating to Post Office .

Shared drives are also used for a similar purpose.

Prior to 2008, Fujitsu used a self-built system, Project
Web, for this purpose. This system is still available in a
read-only format, altho access to the system is
technically more difficult because it is a legacy system.

As explained in relation to the extraction of documents from Post
Office's SharePoint, similar issues may be encountered when
extracting documents from Fujitsu's SharePoint.

Emails

The vast majority of Fujitsu's internal communications take
place via email.

Fujitsu does not operate a formal email archiving policy or system.
Therefore, to the extent that any emails are not stored in other
accessible locations, availability will be limited to those held in
individual users' email accounts. As users have a storage limit on
their accounts, emails are routinely deleted upon reaching that limit.

On average, between 250 to 350'Bedple at Fujitsu work on Post
Office's account at one time. Consequently, there have been
thousands of people at Fujitsu who have worked on Horizon over the
17 years since the system was developed.

“T£S” = Triole for Service
Matthew Lenton, 06/12/2017 11:20 AM

Yes, I have confirmed this with our subject matter expert.
Matthew Lenton, 06/12/2017 11:33 AM

I think “by temporary arrangement” would be more accurate — it’s not technically difficult, just restricted by internal Fujitsu IT admin.
Matthew Lenton, 06/12/2017 11:24 AM

I don’t know what those issues are, so cannot comment.

We should perhaps make clear that documentation stored in SharePoint, on file shares, and in Project Web, is regarded as uncontrolled,
working documentation, that is not held in a completely formalised structure, in contrast to the Dimensions document repository.
Matthew Lenton, 06/12/2017 11:25 AM

Might be more accurate to say “emails are routinely deleted from the users’ own email account, but may be subsequently stored in
locally held .pst files”.
Matthew Lenton, 06/12/2017 11:28 AM

I think 400 is more accurate as the upper number. Currently there are 427 people regarded as being “Account members”.
Matthew Lenton, 06/12/2017 11:31 AM

I would suggest this is more “possible” than “likely”. I think most people are in the habit of storing important information at least in

some other networked repository, even if only via email.
Matthew Lenton, 06/12/2017 11:44 AM

“individual Fujitsu PCs or local storage devices” might cover it better — many people use a portable hard disk for back up purposes.
