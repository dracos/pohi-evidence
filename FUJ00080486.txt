1. INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this document is to establish the incident handling scope of the Horizon
System Helpdesk. It details the support structure to be used within ICL Pathway, its call
sources, incident types and classification, incident prioritisation and closure criteria.

The document will be used as the control point for all incidents handled by the Horizon
System Helpdesk. Any future growth in incident sources will be sized, evaluated and
reflected in this document to ensure effective support is identified in advance of incident
take on.

Whilst this document does not address call volumes it is closely linked to the ICL Pathway
Business Volumetrics document (Reference CS/PER/002) and the ICL Pathway Business
Portfolio (reference CS/PER/001). The Business Volumetrics document estimates call
volumes associated with the incidents types listed in this document.

2 SCOPE

The document reflects the anticipated steady state operation of ICL Pathway from Model
Office Trial onwards.

This document will be used to identify all the types of incidents which are expected to be
made by either Post Office Counter staff, POCL Clients, DSS Office staff, DSS (CAPS)
staff or Customers. The current sources of incidents listed in this document are from POCL
Outlets, ICL Pathway operations and the DSS domain via the ITSA helpdesk. There is no
formal route in place at this time to register incidents from the POCL domain for POCL or
its clients. However it is anticipated that incident enquiries regarding status and progression
will be by POCL/PDA.

The Horizon System Helpdesk call matrices in this document are scoped principally for the
Benefit Encashment Service (BES), APS, OBCS and EPOSS services, for the OPS service
and strategic infrastructure service.

3. ICL PATHWAY SUPPORT

Technical support for the ICL Pathway operation is provided by various suppliers working
together to provide a complete and seamless service. The support structure is divided into
different skill areas and to different levels of expertise. The organisation and systems
involved within the ICL Pathway support structure are designed to bring Post Offices and
broken components back into operation as quickly as possible.

All technical support or request for information is gained by calling the Horizon System
The Horizon System Helpdesk provides first level support for
all technical issues. The Horizon System Helpdesk staff will record details of the issue or
request by ascertaining information from the customer regarding the nature and impact of
the problem, the Horizon System Helpdesk operator will be able to resolve or diagnose the
problem during this initial telephone conversation. Should the operator fail to resolve the
problem at this time, he will route the incident onto a second line support unit and inform
the customer what to expect and when.

Second line support will either resolve the problem or gather further diagnostic evidence in
advance of passing the incident into third line support. Second line support will generally be
equipped to deal with known issues and will implement a workaround or fix to the problem.
Second line support staff will have greater expertise than the first line operations staff.

Third line support will generally deal with new problems, that require changes to the
operation such as software patches and configuration changes. Third line support are the
interface into the product suppliers and will manage these suppliers in the production of
product changes in response to bug reports.

4.2

ICL PATHWAY CALL PROFILES.

All valid calls to the Horizon System Helpdesk will be recorded as incidents and allocated
an incident number. Each incident will be allocated a separate number and not grouped as
one incident (For example, a Postmaster with two printers broken will be given two separate
incident numbers).

Once closed an incident may not be reopened. Any further incidents with the operation or
equipment will be registered as a new incident.

CALL SEVERITY AND PRIORITISATION.

All incidents recorded at the Horizon System Helpdesk will be allocated a priority code
depending on the problem and on the impact of that problem.

Calls are prioritised at either A, B and C priority.

A priority incidents are for issues that have a significant business impact or are urgent. The
target call to fix (CTF) time for all A priority incidents is 4 hours.

B priority incidents are for issues that have a minor business impact but still cause
disruption to the service delivery. The target call to fix (CTF) time for all B priority
incidents is 8 hours.

All incidents received from the Post Office will be prioritised as either A or B priority all A
and B priority incidents will be subject to escalation against the CTF target times.

C priority incidents are for issues that have an operational impact on ICL Pathway but are
not impacting the service delivery to the Post Office. The target call to fix on C priority
incidents is 72 hours. C priority incidents will not be subject to escalation.

CALL CLASSIFICATION.

Calls will be identified by source for example Post Office or DSS and will be classified by
support area and type. Each incident type will have a support process describing the support
activities from first through to third and in some cases, fourth line support.

During the initial telephone call the Horizon System Helpdesk operator will determine what
incident type the problem relates to and allocate a incident reference or classification.

Calls are classified by and support area and type to enable effective and swift routing of the
incident towards the correct support channel.

4.2.1 CLASSIFICATION AREAS

The following table describes the sources of calls into the Horizon System Helpdesk, the
classification of calls likely from each source and the associated system code allocated when
an incident is registered.

The sources currently identified as requiring to register incidents onto the Horizon System
Helpdesk are DSS/BA domain, POCL clients via the POCL Data centres/helpdesks and
from Post Offices/Pathway estate (ie Pathway suppliers). The interface into POCL data
centres is likely to be via a helpdesk but this has not yet been defined. Business routes from
DSS and POCL are also as yet undefined and therefore not included in this document.

4.3. CALL CLOSURE.

Incidents registered by the Horizon System Helpdesk will progress through three stages,
open, cleared and closed. Open relates to when the incident is recorded by the Horizon
system helpdesk, Cleared relates to when the faulty component or operation is brought back
into operation ie a fix or a workaround is applied. Closed relates to all the activities in the
incident being completed.

All incidents recorded onto the Horizon System Helpdesk system will be tracked through
the support channels and escalation will apply until the problem area is brought back into
operation or “cleared”. Ownership of this “cleared” process sits with the unit which is
currently actioned with the incident. Calls that are cleared may not necessarily be resolved
as the owning unit may have implemented a work around to bring the Post Office back into
operation or there may be outstanding activities such as asset or documentation changes. In
these cases incidents will not be closed until all activities are completed or a resolution is
found and applied.

Calls will be closed against predetermined criteria for each incident area. These criteria are
as follows:

4.3.1 CLOSURE CODES

The intention is to keep closure codes to a minimum list however it is recognised that this
list is not exhaustive and will be updated as the service matures.

4.3 Call suspension

There are instances when incidents may be suspended if the incident logged cannot be
cleared due to an external influence outside of ICL Pathway’s control, such as the engineer
cannot gain access to the Post Office premises. Calls may only be suspended if they relate to
the Post Office and must be approved by the Horizon System helpdesk duty manager to
agreed procedures.

Calls that are suspended must be recorded as suspended and be the subject of a weekly
report to ICL Pathway.

APPENDIX A - GLOSSARY OF TERMS

Closure Codes

Advice/Information Given (Application)

Primarily for closure against User Query where usage of a counter application is
being sought/questioned in a non-fault situation (ie how do I?).

Advice/Info Given (General)

Catchment closure for Supplier Query, Pathway Query or User Queries not relating
to direct usage of an application in a non-fault situation.

Known Operational Problem

For closure by the Helpdesk against a Master operational error/problem incident.
Generally will be duplicate closures against an existing problem (eg a link being down
affects several PO’s).

No Fault Found

Investigations have ascertained that evidence of an error can’t be found (eg in
journals/event logs) or reproduced in same/similar circumstances.

Error in Operation

Investigations have ascertained that the error/problem was caused by the
user/operator not using the system correctly in order to produce the desired result (eg ’'m
trying to do this and it’s not working).

Repaired/Reconnected/Reboot/Reconfigured

For closure against incidents (generally hardware), where the problem has been
corrected without replacing any equipment. For example, power cable was not connected,
system was rebooted to establish connection, configuration details were incorrect.

Replaced

For closure against Hardware incidents, where the problem was resolved by
replacing a piece of equipment.

FUJ00080486

ICL Pathway Horizon System Help Desk Call Enquiry Ref: CS/FSP/0002
Matrix Version: 1.0
Date: 13/03/97
Environmental

For closure against problems which are due to environmental problems outside of
the equipment casing. For example, power was cut off, air conditioning faulty causing
machine to overheat.

Non-Pathway Problem

For closure against incidents where the resolution is outside the scope of Pathway’s
responsibilities. A incident is logged for information purposes and where possible the caller
is given an alternative contact.

Workaround/avoidance action provided

For closure against software incidents where a problem has been encountered and
avoidance action or workaround has been provided which has cleared/circumvented the
error. The workaround/ avoidance is a one-off to clear a one-off problem or is to be made
available to be repeated (through the Known Error log), a future correction is not planned as
impact is viewed as minimal.

Fixed in next release

A workaround/avoidance action has been provided but the impact is sufficient to
warrant a correction in a future release of the product.

Published Known Error

For closure by the Helpdesk against queries/problems which match against a Known
Error Log entry. It is required that the KEL reference number is part of the closure statement
so that Known Error frequency can be ascertained.

Enhancement/Change Proposal

The request is outside the scope of the current requirements for either the product or
the service.

Request Accepted

For closure against general requests for either a service or a product (ie Training,
Consumables, Documentation, Installation, Moves). Completion of the request (ie
attendance on the training course, delivery of the consumable, correction of the
documentation) is outside the scope of the incident management process but the completion
owner has accepted responsibility to deliver.

Request Completed

For closure against general requests for either a service or a product which has been
delivered inside the scope of the incident management process. For example, new PO
installed.

Incident Opened

This describes an incident recorded on the Horizon System Helpdesk call management
system. It is the point at which SLA the clock will start on each incident.

Incident Cleared

This is the point in an incident’s life when the reported failure is brought back into operation
