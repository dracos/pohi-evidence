Introduction

Post Office Account provides support to Post Office Security Investigations in their
legal actions against Post Masters. Generally speaking this is in the form of audit data,
witness statements and, if required, appearances in court.

Occasionally Post Office will request special assistance in matters that do not fit the
standard service described above. The dispute at Cleveleys revolves around the Post
Master being dismissed by PO in November 2000, ostensible for ‘unacceptable
losses’, her counter-claim for damages for unfair dismissal and her refusal to return
Horizon equipment to Post Office as she felt that it’s contents would somehow
vindicate her claims.

Scope

This report does not set out to address the case itself, merely what POA have provided
as support and some of the issues identified in providing that assistance. It does make
recommendations as to the outcome of this case although at the time of writing
attempts were being made by PO to reach an out of court settlement with the Post
Master.

Management Summary

The problem we have experienced with this case is that the Expert, in his original
Report, made a number of general assertions that are actually quite hard to refute
since there is no audit data available that would allow a point-by-point rejection of his
claims. He has also drawn conclusions about the Horizon System Helpdesk without
considering fully the way that the HSH operates, ie to get the outlet up and running as
quickly as possible to minimise business interruption to the PM. We have offered to
host him at any of our locations so he can analyse HSH data direct, speak to the
experts and walkthrough the problem management cycle for himself. He will not have
seen this offer since it was contained in the email that accompanied our final response
and this has not been passed on to the Expert.

Unfortunately, POA cannot prove that the system operated correctly during 2000
since we do not have transaction data that will demonstrate that fact. Equally, any
proving that we could do, for example, by design walkthroughs with the Expert,
would prove nothing since it would be a 2004 system baseline that was being
considered, not one from 2000.

Arguably we were brought into this too late. Our first involvement was August 2003,
some 6 months after the court appointed the Expert and some three years after the
original dismissal of the PM. The Expert, who was supposed to be jointly appointed,
has taken a very one-sided view of life and has drawn conclusions that are based on a
paper review of HSH call logs covering the period from initial rollout of the office to
November 2000. In some cases his analysis of the call logs is incomplete and stops at
the point where it supports his opinion.

Fujitsu Services Report on Cleveleys Post Office

Company in Confidence

When confronted with a comparative analysis of HSH calls for all 6 counter outlets
the Expert dismissed it and implied that we might have deliberately withheld the
information from him in the first place. This was rejected strongly in our final
response.

4.0 Chronology

15/08/03 I POA initial involvement following request by PO for Witness Statement declaring that there will be no
transaction data on some Horizon equipment that the Post Master (PM) was refusing to return to PO
since it would support her counter-claim for unfair dismissal,

It was known at this time that a court order had been made for a computer expert to look at the losses
at Cleveleys and whether they were caused by the Horizon equipment as was being claimed by the
PM

15/08/03 I JH brought issue to attention of CLS and questioned legal position wrt 3° party having access to the
equipment to conduct forensic examination:

20/08/03 I PO (Jim Cruise) sent fax formally requesting witness statement and background information from
their solicitors (dated 17/02/03) surrounding the appointment of a single Joint Expert be instructed on
the issue of liability and causation.

21/08/03 I A preliminary report (email) was despatched by JH to JC that identified that we did not have any audit
data for Cleveleys for the period in question (02/00 to 11/00) and explaining the issues around trying
to ‘fire-up’ a counter that has been dormant for >35 days (as was the case with this equipment). POA
also stated that we would not be prepared to allow a 3” party direct access to the counter.

06/02/04 I Nothing more was heard for almost 6 months until we received a letter from Post Office containing the
Experts report. PO were concerned that the report claimed that the equipment installed at Cleveleys
was defective and that the Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH) was more concemed with closing calls
than resolving problems. PO feared that if the report went unchallenged it could set a precedent for
other cases being progressed against PMs

12/02/04 I JHIJC discussed situation and JC asked that we respond to Expert's report with anything that might
help him change some or all of the opinions expressed in the report. In particular, any comparisons
with other similar Outlets that would suggest that Cleveleys was nothing out of the ordinary would be
very helpful. JC also confirmed that the equipment had still not been returned to PO and that it was
not examined as part of the Expert's review.

12102104 I JH realised that HSH call logs were still available for the period in question and obtained a call
analysis for other 6 counter outlets. The analysis was not conclusive but it did indicate that Cleveleys
could not be considered as out of the ordinary with regard to number of calls or the spread of call
types.

There followed a short period during which the Expert's Report was considered within POA.

20/02/04 I CLS wrote to Keith Baines with our detailed response to the Expert's Report. The POA response
challenged all of the Expert's conclusions and opinions and identified, through the HSH call analysis,
that the call profiles for Cleveleys was consistent with other 6 counter outlets.

27102/04 I The Expert replied to our response, through the PO's solicitors, stating that he saw nothing in the
POA response that would cause him to change his opinion. There was an implication in his reply that,
POA had been less than honest in the area of HSH call logs — we had previously stated that data was
not available since it was deleted after 18 months. While this is true of audit data sourced from a
regulated archive the unregulated Powerhelp files from which the analysis was sourced was
available. JC advised POA by email that the Expert's Report was not acceptable to PO and that an
application needs to be made to the court for Fujitsu to give evidence about the Horizon system and
its working

12/03/04 _I A final response to the Experts reply to our original response was prepared and despatched to JC.

19/03/04 I JHIJC discussed the case. JC advised that PO were going to make an offer to the PM and were not
forwarding our final response to the Expert pending the outcome of their offer.
