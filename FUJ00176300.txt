Without Prejudice Subject to Contract

Dear Mike
Lost Data and Audit Trail
I refer to Keith Baines’ letter dated 30 August 2002.

The proposition contained in the above letter was raised by Stephen Muchow at the
meeting with Alan Barrie on 3 September 2002. Further to that meeting, and as a
goodwill gesture, Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Limited is, subject to the conditions set
out below, prepared to make a without prejudice offer of £100,000, in order to bring
this issue to a close. This amount would be:

1. Made in full and final settlement of all PO Limited's claims against Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Limited in respect of lost audit data (as specified in your
letter of 6 February 2002);

2. Made without admission of liability;

3. Effected as a credit against Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Limited's charges for
new business introduced into the terms of the Codified Agreement through
future CCNs (but excluding charges payable under any CCNs relating to the
Debit Card Method of Payment);

4. Subject to approval of a CCN documenting the necessary changes to be made
to the Codified Agreement in respect of data storage. I attach our proposed
changes to the Codified Agreement, which would form part of that CCN.
