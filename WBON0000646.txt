All,

Re the Settle Centrally box, to reach agreement I suggest we adopt Freeths's wording + the highlighted bit.

(1) A credit or debit entry for value of the TC is made in the SPM's branch account; and

(2) A corresponding debit or credit is made in the SPM's customer account with Post Office. If a debit, this will be
treated as a debt by Post Office

TC

The change to the Settle Centrally box is not remotely “neutral” — it is contrary to our pleading that a

disputed sum that is settled centrally is not a debt.
lam otherwise relaxed about the changes.

I do not object to references being removed.
