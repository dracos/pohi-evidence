1 POST OFFICE BOARD - PO BD

MR BURROWS, Chairman of the Negotiating Committee, advised that the letter from the
General Secretary dated 22nd July 1997 indicated that Sir Michael Heron had announced his
retirement and Mr. Richard Adams had been appointed as Secretary of The Post Office. No
announcement had been made as to the new Chairman of The Post Office.

MR. MARSHALL expressed concern regarding mis-management of The Post Office
resulting in Retail Network Managers causing frustration to Sub-Postmasters.

MR. EDMONDSON commented that many employees within Post Office Counters
would agree with Mr. Marshall.

THE GENERAL SECRETARY advised that John Roberts, Chief Executive of The
Post Office had agreed to reinstate the meetings between the General Secretaries
of the CWU, CMA and NFSP with the Post Office.

GOVERNMENT REVIEW - PO PZ

2 EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - OCTOBER 1997
GOVERNMENT REVIEW

The Federation's response to the questions put by the Minister of State, fan McCartney MP,
on the Govemment Review was sent to the Government on 4th August and circulated to the
Executive Council on 1st August. The next move by the Government in connection with their
review was awaited, The correspondence of 22nd August containing press articles about the
Sell off The Post Office had been put down to speculation and denied by Government,
although John Roberts and the Corporate Board were quoted in the articles and had not
publicly denied the position as set out in the press articles.

3 POST OFFICE COUNTERS
3(a) POST OFFICE COUNTERS BOARD - PO PC 02

Deep concern had been expressed about where the Business was going on a number of
major issues and consequently a Strategy meeting took place between the Negotiating
Committee and the Post Office Executive Committee on 9th October. Those attending from
The Post Office were:-

Stuart Sweetman, Managing Director

Dick Wheelhouse, Commercial Director
Paul Rich, Development Director

David Morphey, Business Strategy Director
Rob Durrant, Communications Director
David Walker, Branded Markets Director
Mark Douglas, Financial Market Director

The meeting was held under the Normal Chatham Rules for such meetings and the agreed
outputs will be circulated. However, the following subjects were discussed in great detail:

Scottish Power

PayPoint / Bill Payment
Horizon

Royal Mail

The Corporate Financial Regime

MR. JANNETTA suggested that if a client did not renew its contract, then Post
Office Counters should not allow it to continue past the expiry date as that allowed
clients time to organise alternative outlets, as in the case of Scottish Power.

MR. ABERNETHY expressed deep concern over the delay in the installation of the
Horizon platform, whilst other competitors were gaining a foothold in the market.

MR. BRENNAN believed there was a deliberate delay in the installation of Horizon
by the Benefits Agency so as to avoid business being given to the Post Office.

MR. C. JONES was extremely worried at the tactics of Post Office Counters and
proposed the Council censured the Post Office for its lack of foresight and planning
to counteract the activities of major competitors and thus causing a major threat to
Sub-Postmasters’ incomes and business. Seconded by Mr. Brennan.

MR. BROADWITH reported he had interviewed Paul Rich for The SubPostmaster
journal. One specific question had asked whether it was considered that the delays
were such that ICL, Pathway, Fujitsu would withdraw. Paul Rich had categorically
Stated that was not the case. Reviews had been conducted by all those concerned
who had stated they would continue and were very enthusiastic about the project.

MR. BURROWS commented they had been unaware of the rapid escalation .
between February and August of the number of terminals in other outlets for

PayPoint. Horizon was a disaster scenario which demonstrated the lack of

technology and importance of installing automation to handle EPOS and bill

payment activities. The difficulty was not having the capability to plug the gap in the

marketplace. ACT would always remain. Difficulty had also been experienced in

getting the Benefits Agency computer system compatible with Horizon. if necessary

the Federation would go direct to the Corporate Board. There was a need to

question what price contracts were undertaken in the future.

THE GENERAL SECRETARY urged that considerable caution be exercised with
tegard to Pathway and the Benefits Agency and that. the difficulties were not
advertised. If the Benefits Agency was forced into making a public statement, they
could opt for direct debit. The Benefits Agency was also struggling with its own
computerisation project, CAPS.

« The Executive Council censures the Post Office for its lack of DECISION
foresight and planning to counteract the activities of major
competitors, and thus causing a major threat to Sub-Postmasters’
incomes and businesses.

MR. C. JONES clarified the use of the word censure as showing one’s active
displeasure at what was going on.

TRAINING FOR SUBPOSTMASTERS - PC HR 04

The correspondence of 25th September was confirmation of an action point conceming
training in the North East Region which, it was hoped, had now been resolved. The further
correspondence dated 4th September contained a letter dated 26th August 1997 from the
Head of Resourcing of the Retail Development Centre. The promised publications and
training support were awaited. The Negotiating Committee would keep closely attuned to this
very important subject and it was hoped to see positive initiatives.

MR. EVANS reported on the difficulty in funding for training in the South East and
the trial of 2 weeks in a classroom and 1 week on site after issuance of the letter of
appointment. Sub-Postmasters had reported of trainers being moved about the
Region with one office having 3 different trainers in one week. New Sub-
Postmasters were bitterly complaining about inadequate training resulting in losses
occurring. MR. BURROWS suggested if the problems could not be resolved within
the Region, they would be taken up nationally. Pre-appointment training had been
an ambition of the Federation.

aN

MR. MARSHALL indicated that his Region was having a problem in getting the right
people as trainers.

8(b) COUNTER AUTOMATION - BA/POCL - PC NW 06 01

The action points from the General Secretary's visit to the North East had been circulated as
had information in the form of an update of 6th August which was produced by Post Office
Counters and circulated to the offices involved in the live trial. There was considerable
Concem around the network about the delay in rolling out the Horizon platform and was one
of the subjects which had been discussed by the Negotiating Committee with the Counters
Executive Committee on Thursday, 9th October. There had been a number of reviews in

EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - OCTOBER 1997 7

NFSP00000494
NFSP00000494

respect of the future of Horizon. The reviews had all come out positively in favour of
continuing with the intention of automating every post office as reported in the Negotiating -
Committee minutes of 22/23 September. Nevertheless, there was much rumour and
speculation in the network and people were becoming sceptical as to whether they would see
the roll out at all, or whether it would be delayed once more. The Federation had ensured
Post Office Counters continued to communicate to Sub-Postmasters. In that regard Paul
Rich, the Director responsible for the automation platform, was interviewed for The
SubPostmaster journat. {t was understood the article would appear in the November edition.
The General Secretary's visit to the South West to view the Horizon platform had been
postponed due to the meeting with the Counters Executive Committee on the day originally
organised. That visit was being re-scheduled.

MR. BROADWITH drew attention to the need to advise members of the payment for
attending Horizon training sessions, THE GENERAL SECRETARY stated the
Executive Council policy was to try and obtain a payment for training and obtain the
tight rate for the job. He pointed out that to date no Sub-Postmaster had had to pay
for any alterations to the office, including electrical work up to the meter. Because
of Mr. Docherty's absence on sick leave no meeting had taken place. The change of
Government had also resulted in a reduction in the Post Office budget. A meeting
was being organised with Post Office Counters. iq

8(c) COUNTER AUTOMATION - ALPS - PC NW 06 07
= Goodwill payment for Sub-Postmasters

Although there was no correspondence on the subject the issue had been raised with Post
Office Counters both in the context of the 1997 pay negotiations and as an outstanding Box
13 issue from the pay review. The increasingly difficult financial circumstances of Post
Office Counters was making the availablility of funds more difficult each month.

MR. DARVILL pointed out the ALPS equipment could not be altered to take the mag
stripe cards and there was no equipment to combat PayPoint in the London area.
He suggested the barcode be looked at.

11 SUBPOSTMASTERS CONTRACT
11(a) TERMINATION PROCEDURES - PC SC

The correspondence circulated on 14th October indicated the latest position regarding a
revised set of termination procedures. Whilst it had been an ambition to conclude the
Procedures by now it could be seen that by careful chipping away improvements had been
made to the current position. From the draft guidelines it could be seen that there were a
fumber of different types of action that could be taken depending upon the various
circumstances of the so-called offence. First, oral wamings which were intended to help and
assist in ending malpractice, thus avoiding the need for further action. Secondly, written
warnings, of which there may be more than one were designed to improve operational
performance. Thirdly, termination of contract by 3 months notice which, as seen from the
guidelines, must not be used as a means of simply avoiding adopting the summary
termination route and the appeals procedures, The next stage was precautionary suspension
which could lead to summary termination of contract. Paragraph 10 addressed the issue of
on-going investigations and stated that if the case could not be resolved within 3 months, the
case must be reviewed as to whether suspension was still warranted and the Sub-Postmaster
informed in writing that the review had taken place. If that course of action was decided
upon, the Sub-Postmaster must be informed of the specific charge against him or her and
could request and must receive all relevant information to the charge. The appeals
procedure was set out and took the form of a complete re-hearing of the specific charge
made against the Sub-Postmaster. In future Post Office Counters could not hide behind the
“loss of confidence” instead of proving the case. The intended timescales were set out in
Paragraph 4 on page 9 for hearing appeals. The six weeks quoted in that paragraph had i
been reduced to 5 weeks as a result of continued pressure. Additionally, work was continuing
on Paragraph 12, page 6, to seek an improvement for those Sub-Postmasters who were re-
instated. The Post Office Counters solicitors are considering re-wording the paragraph. The
ambition was to get as much money as possible pre-paid to a re-instated Sub-Postmaster.
The Council would be kept fully appraised of the reply from Post Office Counters. The
Negotiating Committee sought agreement to the document, excluding Paragraph 12, in order
to be in.a position to introduce the improvements at the earliest opportunity.

The Negotiating Committee was congratulated on the work achieved.

't was noted the Sub-Postmaster’s contract was that of an individual and could not
involve the Federation by right; loss of confidence should be defined (if possible
remove from the flow chart); the appeals managers should be adequately trained.

¢ THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL AGREED to the draft of the Termination DECISION
Procedures circulated on 14th October 1997; the title be changed; the [ACTION
flow chart be amended by removal of the loss of confidence, reword
of Paragraph 12.

Correspondence had been circulated on a number of Conference resolutions. Other
tesolutions due to be acted upon by the Negotiating Committee had been addressed in
meetings. There were, however, a number which were dependant upon the roll out of
Horizon or had fallen victim to the aggressive competitive situation in the bill payment field.
Motion 3, for example, sought to align payments upwards for similar transactions which, in
the bill payment market, could lead to disastrous consequences, Motions 28 and 29 were
awaiting the next meeting on automation, the regular Forums having been postponed due to
the transfer of Mr. Docherty from the Retail Development Centre. Mr. Granville had agreed
that the meetings would be reinstated and the date of the next meeting was awaited.

+ THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL APPROVED the report of the Negotiating
Committee.

B) FINANCE

(i) Treasurers Report FIAC 02

Referring to his circulated report, MR EDMONDSON, the National Treasurer,

advised the Accounts for the half year to 30 June 1997 had been circulated and

indicated the position of the Federation. Although certain large items could be €
explained, nevertheless, during the last 18 months, £500,000 of the Federation's

savings had been introduced and expended.

He and Philip Bloor, Finance Manager, had spent time stripping the accounts and
looking for items where savings could be made. Small amounts had been identified
but if there was to be a major impact then changes would have to be made to the
way both Shoreham and the Executive Council were run. However, he did not feel
there should be any over-reaction at this stage and it had been decided to delay
taking any action until the end of the Financial Year 1997 to see if there was an
upturn in recruiting following the remandating campaign.

The Federation had to get membership back up to the 15,000 mark and beyond
that. If it managed to reach that figure, there would be few worries, if not major
surgery would be required and the Federation would never be the same again.

He was pleased to see that some of the decisions taken at the current meeting
would help in saving/not increasing costs and care must be taken not to make
mistakes in the future, (

On the 27th October Philip Bloor would be carrying out a budget exercise on the
Federation's finances based on membership at that date. With a better overall
picture, subscriptions would be considered and recommendations made to the P&D
Committee, particularly on multi-tiers, multiple rates, percentages to Branches. The
Chairman had agreed that the General Secretary and himself should attend the
November P&D Meeting. He hoped Executive Officers fully realised the problems.

MR BURFORD expressed concern over 2 items: Centenary books and the
Members’ Legal Helpline which, he had been advised, members found useful - but
was it a luxury provided for the few people who did use it, he wondered.

MR HEASMAN advised that the total number of people using the Helpline was just
over 600 and most calls were specific to employment issues. He would be meeting
with Peter Abraham on Monday 27th October to see how best to adjust the cost of
the service. There appeared to be 2 options (i) negotiate the price down, (ii) provide

28 EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETING - OCTOBER 1997

difference type of system bearing in mind that most of the calls were on
employment law.

THE GENERAL SECRETARY drew attention to the fact that the Helpline was
introduced as the result of a Conference Motion and it had been apparent that it
would be an expense. He supported what the National Treasurer had said, there
were 2 options (i) reduce the spend, or (ii) maximise income. Reducing costs were
difficult, Headquarters should do what it can to reduce running costs, tuming lights
off, looking at the general spend, etc. In return for Shoreham doing that, he asked
that every member of the Executive Council should do his/her bit regarding his/her
expenditure. But, more important, the Federation needed members.

Referring to Mr Bloor’s 6-monthly report on the state of the Federation's financial
situation, MR CHALLINOR stated that modern business practice was to check
accounts on a monthly basis: actual against budget. He wondered upon what
Mr Bloor’s budget was based, ie, on-going performance or one-off sum. He pointed
out that the Federation was 10 months into its financial year, leaving only 2 months
to make things look better.

¢ The Report of the National Treasurer was ACCEPTED.

DISCUSSION ON THE FUTURE STRUCTURE/STRATEGY OF THE NATIONAL
FEDERATION OF SUBPOSTMASTERS

GROUP 2 - MEMBERSHIP

The Group had last met on 7th October 1997 and MR EVANS drew attention to the

circulated notes (KD/gp October 1997) reporting the Group's deliberations, upon

which he briefly elaborated describing the recommendations regarding the
recommended process for: (1) (2) and (3) contacting new Sub-Postmasters, where (
Group felt the RDC procedure in following up recruitment of new Sub-Postmaster

inadequate, and the recommended steps to be taken at Branch/Regional level to

foster good relations; and the procedures that Federation Headquarters should

adopt. There were also comments and recommendations under the heading of

Union Facilities.

« THE CHAIRMAN confirmed that all the recommendations were
APPROVED by the Executive Council, with the EXCEPTION of that
relating to the Executive Council, and officers being appointed to
working parties to advise on ad hoc issues (on page 4 of the notes).
