Note from SAH

POL00302815
POL00302815

I have prepared and sent this note to SS for their consideration. It suggests a way of approaching
the claims- my suggestions are no more than tentative. Perhaps we could discuss on the phone on
Thursday.

Quantify the losses for which SPM is or has
been alleged to be responsible.

Is it alleged by the PO that the losses were
caused by theft?

If yes, then, in the reasoned opinion of SS,
were the losses caused by theft?

Is it alleged (directly or indirectly) by the PO
that the SPM, by some identified or
unidentified act or omission, caused the
losses?

If yes, then, in the reasoned opinion of SS, did
the SPM cause the losses and, if so and if
possible, how?

If in the reasoned opinion of SS the SPM
caused the losses, should the SPM, in the
reasoned opinion of SS, be held wholly or
partially responsible for the losses? In
considering this question, SS should consider
whether, for example, the SPM received
adequate training and/or assistance and
whether the SPM could have or should have
carried out checks to identify the causes of
the losses?

If in the reasoned opinion of SS the SPM did
not cause the losses, what, in the reasoned
opinion of SS, were the causes of the losses?

In giving its opinion on disputed issues of fact, SS should explain what standard of proof SS

has applied, ranging from sure to probable/likely.

In reaching its opinion, SS will have regard to other cases similar to that of the applicant.
