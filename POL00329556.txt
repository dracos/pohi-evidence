Dear Solicitor to the Inquiry

We refer to our letter dated 29 December 2023 (attached for convenience) regarding disclosure of documents related
to Mr Bradshaw and the email received from the Inquiry at approximately 15:57 today. That email sought an update
as to when the 24 documents produced to the Inquiry on 29 December 2023 (namely, the 21 documents informally
produced at approximately 16:04 and the 3 additional documents informally produced at approximately 21:35) will be
formally produced to the Inquiry via Egress.

We confirm that all 24 documents are on track to be formally produced to the Inquiry this week, as foreshadowed in
our letter dated 29 December 2023. Specifically:

1. The 3 documents informally produced at approximately 21:35 on 29 December 2023 will be uploaded to
Egress tomorrow (4 January 2024) as PRODO6G4A. A note from Peters & Peters relating to this production and
additional work being conducted in relation to Mr Bradshaw is attached; ad

2. The 21 documents informally produced at approximately 16:04 on 29 December 2023 are on track to be
formally produced to the Inquiry this week. These documents may be ready to be loaded to Egress tomorrow
(4 January 2024), however owing to some implications relating to family documents and the need to conduct
pre-production checks, it may not be possible for the production to be loaded to Egress until Friday (5 January
2024). Either way, we confirm that the 21 documents will be formally produced to the Inquiry as quickly as
possible and within the timeframe foreshadowed in the letter dated 29 December 2023.

Please let us know if the Inquiry requires any further assistance in relation to this.

Yours faithfully

Herbert Smith Freehills LLP

Dear Solicitor to the Inquiry

We refer to our letter sent earlier today (attached), which enclosed a note prepared by Peters & Peters. In that note
Peters & Peters stated that the transcripts of three audio tapes related Stephen Bradshaw’s interview of Joan Francis
Boiley (sic Bailey) would be informally produced as soon as the transcriptions were complete.

Please find attached those three transcripts, as provided to us by Peters & Peters. We note our understanding, from
Peters & Peters, that the audio files were in places of low quality, which has affected the clarify of the transcription.

This material will be uploaded by way of formal production to the Inquiry’s Egress site in the week beginning 2
January 2024.

Yours faithfully
