Jonathan,

I discussed with Chris a call tomorrow would be very helpful. are you able to sort a time?

Chris suggested he would not go to all of the mediation sessions so that would create some flexibility.
Thanks

Chris, Belinda

In preparation for Christa’s presentation to the Board on Wednesday, we were wondering if you would like to set up a
call to discuss how you would like Christa to approach the meeting and what she can expect on the day.

Kind regards

Thanks Jonathan, having discussed with Rod, could I suggest, for clarity, one change to the end of para 5.47 as below:

We include this point not because it impacts on the legal liability to repay losses per se but because such a practice
would narrow very considerably, or remove completely, the scope forarg Lastowheth SPMR eheent,
r + incelatend yt Be +e-exist a SPMR to argue that a particular loss was caused by

something other than his own negligence, carelessness or error, and therefore not recoverable from him.

Also could I ask you to remove the track change to the footer and insert ‘Subject to Legal Professional Privilege’ on the
cover and send me a final clean copy which I can submit to the Board.

Thanks

I attach the report and a mark-up showing the comments from Chris and Belinda, and further comments from Rodric
discussed with me over the phone. We will send this version to Richard Morgan for his comment by Monday, on the
assumption it is the version that will now be sent to the Board

Thanks Jonathan — I have had a quick read, and my sense is that this is much more in line with what the Board are
expecting to see. I have no substantive comments, other than to suggest that it may be better to position paragraph 4
(Exec Summary) right at the very front of the report, as a paragraph 1. Others may have additional comments, but I
will leave it to them to get back to you directly. Thanks Chris

I attach a final version of the report and a mark-up showing the changes we have made to address your comments
below.

Given the time available we have not had a chance to run the report by Richard Morgan. We will do so now and
should have any comments back from him before the Board meeting.

Further to our conversation, in addition we may have a few more minor points but I have a couple:

1. In 5.33 you refer to SS’s working relationship with JFSA and Post Office. I do not think it is that SS have a good
working relationship with JFSA and not the Post Office, I think it is more the slant of their report in terms of
acknowledging the input from JFSA rather than Post Office. The wording of the Interim report suggests that
their work was aimed at addressing issues raised through JFSA rather than the fundamental question about
Horizon. Or put another way, JFSA fed in accusations and concerns about which SS then challenged Post
Office. I agree the conclusion about the idiosyncratic nature of the SS approach.

2. In 511, could you refer to 150 applications that have been made to the Scheme. The reason for this is that
the 137 represents a figure, which changes often, is the number of cases left in the Scheme and may not be a
figure that the Board recognises.

Best wishes
Belinda

Hi Jonathan — my detailed comments are set out in the attached. Two big points, though:

1) The intro section needs to be re-worked a bit to make it clear that this report focuses mainly on the legal
liability point, and that you will be working with us in relation to alternative structures (and may be not even
producing a report). The reason for this is that some board members think that the task of coming up with
alternatives to the scheme should be an internally driven bit of work, not something that is outsourced to a
law firm.

2) The executive summary is still pretty long, and doesn’t hit the reader between the eyes with what I
understand to be your main conclusion — namely: Unless there is something wrong with the system, we are
entitled to rely on the accounts produced by Horizon as the basis of claiming sums of money from SPMRs.
Further that there can be no question of a claim for consequential losses based simply on the recovery by the
Post Office of losses if the losses were properly payable and the Post Office was entitled to the money.

These 2 statements together are quite powerful, and need to be brought our clearly, and it also needs to be
said that in consequence the amounts that could be successfully claimed in court are a fraction of the
aggregate amounts (c£100m) that has been claimed under the scheme.

I would be most grateful if you could turn this round asap in the morning.

Cheers

As discussed, I attach our draft report on the legal issues.

There is a factual question that we would like you to confirm in paragraph 5.22 (and a related question in 5.37), but
otherwise please provide any comments you may have in the time available and we will send through a finalised
version as soon as possible in the morning.

In the interests of time, I have left in the outline of “Part B” of the report in this document so that, as requested, you
can see where that part is headed. I will remove it (i.e. everything from section 6 onwards) in the final version for the
Board we send through tomorrow.
