(CPIA 1996 s5(5))

To the Prosecutor: Royal Mail legal Services, 3° Floor, 6a Eccleston Street, London,
SWIW 9LT

To the Court: Newcastle Crown Court DX 65127 Newcastle 2
Name of Accused: — Peter Holmes.

URN:

Charge: Theft from employer,

Date of next hearing: 17 August 2009

Name and address of McKeag and Co

I. The nature of the accused’s defence is: As stated in my interview under caution with
representatives of Royal Mail I did not steal any monies from Jesmond Post Office. I
believe that either the Horizon system has on occasion been at fault and ultimately
created the shortfall by creating incorrect entries. The monies entering the joint Barclays
Account are proceeds from my wife’s business.

I do accept that I did falsify documents to cover the discrepancies but this was only
because I thought error notices would be generated and that the money was not actually
missing.

2. The accused takes issue with the prosecution in relation to the following matters: I do not
believe that the Royal Mail has conducted a thorough investigation and did not consider
any alternative in relation to the allegation.

3. The accused takes issue with the prosecution about these matters for the following
reasons: no other member of staff has been investigated. I have put forward a full
explanation of the money passing through my joint Barclays Account.
