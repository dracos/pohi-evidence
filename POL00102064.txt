I gather from Gavin that you wanted early sight of the paper for discussion at tomorrow evening’s meeting. It’s very
short, in line with Chris’ wishes, and has an annex for each of the options, plus a matrix comparing them at them end.

It’s out for a second round of comments from others prior to circulation early tomorrow to attendees at tomorrow’s
meeting.

I'd envisage a longer piece for a Sub Committee or Board discussion but you can take a view on that.
Kind regards

Patrick
