Sing ; Lesley J Sewellf,

Subject: A couple of thoughts

1 we have a new criminal case starting in brum next monday - bau. jarnail to get CK up to speed using alwen to enable CK to say
something to judge re bugs po have found and disclosed (po have found them, not ss - that's an important pr point) and fact that an
ss interim report may be coming out before mp summer recess (16 july) to offer judge the chance to adjourn the case. That just
makes us look open and transparent and seems the prudent thing to do.

2. Mark d - could we prepare an "on the offensive" comms statement to go out on monday - and we send out letters to relevant
affected subs / ex-subs of the 14 bug on monday too?

This comms statement to include:

- po found the 64 and 14 bugs and told ss (ie ss didn't find them).

- po are being open about them

- get fj to confirm the bugs don't affect the transaction data

- rod williams / jarnail to comfirm that no prosecutions relate to these bugs etc

- say we have been fixing but acknowledge it's taken us a while to.

- give details of the two sets of bugs

- put it in conetxt - size of incorrect balances vis a vis all the transactions we process a day etc

3 rod ismay / simon baker to confirm no other bugs or adjustments!
