Subject: FW: Updated Draft Briefing Note - 02.07.

Attachments: Briefing Note re Second Sight Interim Report - 02.07.13.docx

Martin —there’s one amendment to the longer briefing note which I just sent that should track across into the one Susan

prepared.
It’s a small point, but the second bullet point in the “62 Branch Exception” section of Susan’s note should say
“subpostmaster branch losses ranged from £115.60 down to 8p”, not “Branch losses ranged from £777.96 down to

34p.”

My apologies — the figures came from an earlier version of my document, and reflected my misreading of a spread
sheet.

Kind regards. Rod

All — please see attached.

Main amendment is a new Annex 3 summarising the issues raised by the SPMs who are constituents of James Arbuthnot
and Oliver Letwin (cross referenced in para 13).

Apologies for the delay — my broadband went down!
