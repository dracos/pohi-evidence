07/07/1998 15:26:39 [Martin Molloy] Incorrect Password lifecycle on R1C counters.
07/07/1998 15:26:39 [Martin Molloy] A problem exists on all R1C counters whereby the expected lifecycle of a
07/07/1998 15:26:39 [Martin Molloy] password expiring that should be set for 30 days does not exist. In other
07/07/1998 15:26:39 [Martin Molloy] words post office staff will be able to use their existing passwords
07/07/1998 15:26:39 — [Martin Molloy] indefinately without the system promting for a change. A S/W fix was set up
07/07/1998 15:26:39 [Martin Molloy] which would ensure that the counter system would prompt post office staff to
07/07/1998 15:26:39 [Martin Molloy] change their password after 180 days i.e. 6 months but folloowing a
07/07/1998 15:26:39 [Martin Molloy] conversation between ICL Pathway and POCL Security it was determined that the
07/07/1998 15:26:39 — [Martin Molloy] actual timeframe should be 30 days i.e. 1 month.
07/07/1998 15:26:39 [Martin Molloy]
07/07/1998 15:26:39 [Martin Molloy] The S/W fix was ammended appropriately but before it was sent down to the
07/07/1998 15:26:39 [Martin Molloy] outlets it was discovered that there was a problem with this fix such that if
07/07/1998 15:26:39 — [Martin Molloy] a counter position were to force sign off an operator i.e. after 74

consecuative minutes of unuse and at the same time the password expired then
the postmaster would have to reboot the system before changing his password.
This was deemed unacceptable to send out like this as although the chances of
this scenario happening were very low it might happen and would cause

inconvenience to the outlet involved.

There is another PinICL open (i.e. pc0012010 ) which I have raised to A
priority in order that it is given urgent attention by Escher to provide a

fix.

Awaiting update from Steve Warwick.

F} Response :

Latest update on "technical" call states that Tony Oppenheim will stress the
importance of this issue being resolved with Mike Murphy in Escher in order
that a fix can be produced. Awaiting his update.

F} Response :

Letters have now been sent out to the 4 pilot outlets and responses are
expected from these by 30th october 1998. When received the patch will be
downloaded to the 4 outlets and then these outlets will be monitored for a
period of 1 MONTH. This period was decided on by POCL BSM who want to ensure
that a) there are no adverse effects on the Horizon system from this patch,
and b) that the system will prompt for the password to be changed after the

stipulated time.

I will update the call when the patch has been downloaded.

Responded to call type Z as Category 2 -Progress update

The response was delivered on the system

F} Response :

The S/W patch was successfully downloaded to the 4 pilot outlets on 3rd
november mwithout any ontoward happenings in any of these outlets. POCL have
requested that we now wait 30 days before downl;oading this patch to the
other 200 outlets. This is to ensure that the system does prompt the users to
change their passwords at the 4 pilot sites.

However, before downloading the patch to the other outlets we also want to
force change a baseunit in one of the pilot sites to ensure that this can be

done successfully without any problems arising with passwords. POCL BSM have
agreed to this and will inform of the cjosen outlets in order that I can

organise a swapout. I will update this call with the results.

F} Response :

The forced swapout of the baseunit was 100% successful which gives confidence
that all will be ok when the patch is downloaded to the other 200 outlets.

The next stage in the plan is to wait until the four pilot outlets are forced

by the system to change their password which will confirm that the patch has
been successful. This should happen within the next 7-10 days. Once this has
occurred letters will be sent to the remaining 200 outlets advicing them to

change all user passwords and return the confirmation slip when done. Once

26/11/1998 14:54:29 — [Martin Molloy] (onathan Rogers).

26/11/1998 14:54:29 [Martin Molloy] I will update this call accordingly.

02/12/1998 12:59:20 [Martin Molloy] POCL BSM confirmed this morning, 2/12/98, that users in all 4 pilot outlets

02/12/1998 12:59:20 [Martin Molloy] successfully received a system prompt to change their passwords. This was

02/12/1998 12:59:20 [Martin Molloy] done with no problems arising.

02/12/1998 12:59:20 [Martin Molloy] Letters will now be sent to the remaining 200 outlets advising ALL users to

02/12/1998 12:59:20 [Martin Molloy] change their password asap and return the confirmation slip to POCL BSM when

02/12/1998 12:59:20 [Martin Molloy] agreed with BSM but suspect it will be somewhere between 80%-90%) then I will

02/12/1998 12:59:20 [Martin Molloy] 200 outlets. Being optimistic this will be done before Xmas but realistically

02/12/1998 12:59:20 — [Martin Molloy] I suspect that it will be done early in the New Year.

POCL BSM contacted me today to say that the 200 outlets are being contacted
via an "Update Special" informing them to change all passwords. This Special
was sent out today, 3/12/98, and has a cut-off at the bottom which should be
returned to POCL when all changes have been made. POCL are expecting to have
all replies by Monday 14/12/98 which, if correct, means that I will be able

to get the patch downloaded well in advance of Xmas.

I will update call accordingly.

To date 144 outlets have responded to say that they have changed all the

SW & NE and advised them of the outlets that haven't yet replied. He has
informed the regions that they must get in contact with these outlets and
ensure that by Monday 21/12/98 all passwords must be changed. He will then
